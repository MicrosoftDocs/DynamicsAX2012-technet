> [!NOTE]
> <P>To indicate that a vendor is liable to pay withholding tax, you must select the <STRONG>Calculate withholding tax</STRONG> check box and select a withholding tax group for the vendor. For more information, see <A href="bra-set-up-a-withholding-tax-group-and-attach-it-to-a-customer-or-vendor.md">(BRA) Set up a withholding tax group and attach it to a customer or vendor</A>.</P>
