You can use the Tax Collected at Source (TCS) amounts that are automatically calculated or you can adjust them.

For payments made against an invoice, the following conditions apply:

  - TCS will not be calculated if it has already been calculated at the invoice level, if the payment amount and invoice amount are the same.

  - TCS will not be calculated if the invoice amount, including the TCS amount, exceeds the payment amount.

  - TCS will be calculated on the amount that exceeds the invoice amount, if the invoice amount, including the TCS amount, is less than the payment amount.
