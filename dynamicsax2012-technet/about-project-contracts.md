# About project contracts 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When you enter into a contract with a customer or other funding source to complete a project, you can manage the project in Microsoft Dynamics AX. You must first create a project contract. In the project contract form, you enter information about the terms in the project contract. When you create a project, you must assign the project to a project contract. You set up the details about the project, such as a budget, hierarchy of activities, billing rules, and financial dimensions, in the **Project** form.

The type of project that you create for a project contract determines the method that is used to invoice the project customers. You can modify a project contract and the related project, but you cannot change the project type. For more information about project types, see [About project types](about-project-types.md).
