# Account for revenue recognition from reserves not transferred 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The **Fixed asset posting profiles** form includes the **Provision for reserve** and **Transfer from reserve** transaction types. You can use the **Provision for reserve** transaction type to handle deferred profit on fixed assets. The profit is posted as a liability.

All reserves for deferred profits on fixed assets are dissolved in the future in one of the following ways:

  - As a reduction of the acquisition price of the fixed asset that has been acquired to replace the sold fixed asset

  - As revenue recognition, which means a transfer to the profit and loss accounts

You must select an account that has been set up for revenue recognition.
