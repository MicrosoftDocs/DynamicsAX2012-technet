# Create Microsoft Word documents from Microsoft Dynamics AX 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Many document types in Microsoft Dynamics AX can be saved as Microsoft Word files. After you save a Word document, you can use features in Word to add text and graphics to the document. For example, you can add your organizationâ€™s contact information and logo.

Use the following procedure to create a Word document from a document in Microsoft Dynamics AX.

1.  In Microsoft Dynamics AX, open the document that you want to save as a Word file.

2.  Create a report of the document by pressing CTRL+P. For more information about how to create auto-reports, see [Create a report by using the Microsoft Dynamics AX auto-report wizard](create-a-report-by-using-the-microsoft-dynamics-ax-auto-report-wizard.md).

3.  In the **Autoreport** dialog box, click **OK**.

4.  In the **Autoreport** form, on the top menu, click the **Export** button, and then click **Word**.

5.  Select a location in which to save the file. Your system administrator can create a default folder in which you can save exported documents. For more information, see [Export document types (class form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa616371\(v=ax.60\)).

6.  Enter a name for the file. In the **Save as type** field, select **Word**, and then click **Save**.

7.  Open the Word file from the location that you selected in step 5.

8.  Optional: Add text, images, and other content to the document.
