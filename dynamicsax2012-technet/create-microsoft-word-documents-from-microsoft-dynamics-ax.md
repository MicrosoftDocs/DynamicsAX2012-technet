# Create Microsoft Word documents from Microsoft Dynamics AX [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Many document types in Microsoft Dynamics AX can be saved as Microsoft Word files. After you save a Word document, you can use features in Word to add text and graphics to the document. For example, you can add your organization’s contact information and logo.

Use the following procedure to create a Word document from a document in Microsoft Dynamics AX.

1.  In Microsoft Dynamics AX, open the document that you want to save as a Word file.

2.  Create a report of the document by pressing CTRL+P. For more information about how to create auto-reports, see [Create a report by using the Microsoft Dynamics AX auto-report wizard](create-a-report-by-using-the-microsoft-dynamics-ax-auto-report-wizard.md).

3.  In the **Autoreport** dialog box, click **OK**.

4.  In the **Autoreport** form, on the top menu, click the **Export** button, and then click **Word**.

5.  Select a location in which to save the file. Your system administrator can create a default folder in which you can save exported documents. For more information, see [Export document types (class form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa616371\(v=ax.60\)).

6.  Enter a name for the file. In the **Save as type** field, select **Word**, and then click **Save**.

7.  Open the Word file from the location that you selected in step 5.

8.  Optional: Add text, images, and other content to the document.
