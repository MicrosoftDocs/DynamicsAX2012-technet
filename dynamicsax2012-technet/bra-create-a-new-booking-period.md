# (BRA) Create a new booking period 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Sistema Publico de Escrituração Digital (SPED) fiscal text files provide information about all fiscal documents that have been received and issued in a month. They are used by the federal tax authority to verify Imposto Sobre Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços (ICMS) and Imposto sobre Produtos Industrializados (IPI) tax calculations.

Before you can assess, pay, and declare these taxes and create a SPED fiscal text file, you must create a fiscal booking period for the month. A booking period is a unit of time in a fiscal calendar that corresponds to a calendar month. Booking periods are specified per fiscal establishment, and they include all fiscal documents that are issued and received during the specific booking period. This topic explains how to create a booking period by using the **Booking period** form.
