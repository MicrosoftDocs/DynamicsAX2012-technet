# Configure stores to accept loyalty cards 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

Before a store can participate in a customer loyalty program, you must set up the store to accept a loyalty card. Some stores might not support a loyalty program.

Before you can set up a store to accept a loyalty card, you must set up the loyalty card as a payment method. For more information about how to set up a loyalty card as a payment method, see [Set up loyalty payment methods](set-up-loyalty-payment-methods.md).

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Common** \> **Retail channels** \> **Retail stores**.

2.  On the **Retail stores** list page, select a store in the list. Alternatively, you can create a new store by clicking **Retail store** on the **Action Pane**.

3.  Click the **Set up** tab, and then, on the **Action Pane**, in the **Set up** group, click **Payment methods**.

4.  In the **Payment method** form, click **New** to create a new payment method.

5.  On the **General** FastTab, in the **Payment method** field, select the tender that you created for the loyalty card.

6.  In the remaining fields in the **Payment method** form, enter the information that is required for the store. For more information about how to configure payment methods for a store, see [Set up store payment methods](set-up-store-payment-methods.md).

7.  In the **Payment method** form, on the **Action strip**, click **Card setup**.

8.  In the **Card setup** form, click **New** to add a new loyalty card number.

9.  On the **General** FastTab, do the following:
    
      - In the **Card ID** field, select the loyalty card that you set up.
    
      - Enter a name for the card type.
    
      - Select the **Allow manual approval codes** check box to indicate that a cashier can manually enter a loyalty card number if the card cannot be read correctly.
    
      - Select the **Process locally** check box to indicate that your company uses an internal loyalty transaction service.
    
      - Enter any other requirements that the store has for the loyalty program.
