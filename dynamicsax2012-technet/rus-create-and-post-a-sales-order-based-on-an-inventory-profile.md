_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use the **Sales order** form to post a packing slip, invoice, and facture for a sales order. The inventory profile on the sales order line must belong to the kind of activity that is selected in the sales order, unless the kind of activity is **Unspecified**. The posting profile on the sales order line is defined in the **Inventory profile - posting profile** form. Therefore, if the inventory profile is selected, the corresponding posting profile is selected automatically.

When you select the **Split order lines by inventory profiles** check box in the **Accounts receivable parameters** form, the sales order lines are split by inventory profile, based on the priorities that are set up in the **Inventory profiles** form and the **On-hand inventory** form.

4.  On the **Existing items** tab, in the **Kind of activity** field, select **Unspecified**, **Basic**, **Commission agent**, **Principal's agent**, or **Bailee** as the profile type. You can view the related transactions for the selected kind of activity.

9.  In the **Inventory profile** field, select the required inventory profile.

10. Select the **Use compatible inventory profiles** check box to use the inventory profiles on order lines that are compatible with the inventory profile that is specified in the order.

11. Click the **Pick and pack** tab, and then click **Packing slip** to update the packing slip.

12. Click **OK** to post the packing slip.
