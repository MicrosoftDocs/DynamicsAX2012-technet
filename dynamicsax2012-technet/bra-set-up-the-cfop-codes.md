# (BRA) Set up the CFOP codes 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can create Código Fiscal de Operações e Prestações (CFOP) codes, or fiscal operation codes, by using the **CFOP codes** form. You can also define the default CFOP code for a transaction type or operation type by using the **CFOP matrix** form.

Fiscal operation codes are set up for transactions based on the location of the customer, location of the vendor, location of the fiscal establishment, the direction of the movement of items, and the operation type.

The default location and direction are updated in the **Location** and **Direction** fields in the **CFOP codes** form based on the first digit of the CFOP code. The following table shows the first digits of CFOP codes, and the corresponding default locations and directions.

<table xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <tr>
    <th> <p>
   
	 First digit of CFOP code
  </p> </th>
    <th> <p>
   
	 Location
  </p> </th>
    <th> <p>
   
	 Direction
  </p> </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> <p>
   
	 1
  </p> </td>
    <td> <p> <strong>Same state</strong> – The customer or vendor is located in the same state as the fiscal establishment.
  </p> </td>
    <td rowspan="3"> <p> <strong>Incoming</strong> – Items are entering the fiscal establishment.
  </p> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> <p>
   
	 2
  </p> </td>
    <td> <p> <strong>Other state</strong> – The customer or vendor is located in the same country as the fiscal establishment, but in a different state.
  </p> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> <p>
   
	 3
  </p> </td>
    <td> <p> <strong>Outside country</strong> – The customer or vendor is located in a different country than the fiscal establishment.
  </p> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

  </p> </td>
    <td> <p> <strong>Same state</strong> – The customer or vendor is located in the same state as the fiscal establishment.
  </p> </td>
    <td rowspan="3"> <p> <strong>Outgoing</strong> – Items are leaving the fiscal establishment.
  </p> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> <p>

  </p> </td>
    <td> <p> <strong>Other state</strong> – The customer or vendor is located in the same country as the fiscal establishment, but in a different state.
