# About disposition codes and return reason codes 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

To support their process for returning products, a company can create and use return reason codes and disposition codes in Microsoft Dynamics AX.

Use a return reason code to describe the reason that the customer wants to return an item. You can assign a reason code in the **Create return order** form.

Assign a disposition code when an item is received or during the physical inspection of a returned item. You can use disposition codes to describe the condition of the item. You can also use disposition codes to indicate whether additional action is required for the transaction. For example, create disposition codes for the following actions:

  - Scrap the returned item and provide a replacement item to the customer.

  - Return the item to inventory and credit the customer for the cost of the item.

  - Repair the item and return it to the customer.
