# Duplicate a product configuration model 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The following steps describe how to create a new product configuration model based on an existing model. After you duplicate a product configuration model, you can change it to suit the new product.

1.  Click **Product information management** \> **Common** \> **Product configuration models**.

2.  Select the product configuration model to duplicate, and then click **Duplicate** on the **Action Pane**.

3.  In the **Name** field in the lower part of the dialog box, enter a name for the new product configuration model.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The system suggests the name of the selected product configuration model and adds a _copy suffix, because product configuration model names must be unique. You can change the name.</P>



4.  In the **Description** field, enter a description of the new product configuration model.
