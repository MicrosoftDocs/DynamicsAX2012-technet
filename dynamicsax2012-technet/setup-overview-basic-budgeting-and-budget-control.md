# Setup overview: basic budgeting and budget control 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This topic contains information that will help you get ready to set up basic budgeting and budget control.

If you’re in the public sector and use general budget reservations, see also [Set up general budget reservation rules and reservation types (Public sector)](set-up-general-budget-reservation-rules-and-reservation-types-public-sector.md).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>General budget reservations are available only if the <STRONG>Public Sector</STRONG> configuration key is selected and if Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 Cumulative Update 8 is installed with the following hotfix: KB3047235</P>




> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic includes information about financial budgets. For information about budgets for projects, see <A href="about-project-budgets-and-forecasts.md">About project budgets and forecasts</A>.</P>



## Budgeting configuration keys

Budgeting includes three primary configuration keys.

  - The **Budget** configuration key enables basic budgeting. Basic budgeting includes financial dimensions that are defined for budgeting, budget register entries, and Budgeting workflows.

  - The **Budget control** configuration key adds budget control to basic budgeting. Budget control includes the following features:
    
      - Budget types for pre-encumbrances and encumbrances
    
      - Budget checking for source documents and accounting journals
    
      - Over budget permissions for user groups
    
      - Budget funds available calculation
    
      - Additional features such as financial dimensions that are defined for budget control

  - The **Public Sector** configuration key adds two budget types to basic budgeting that are used by public sector organizations: the **Preliminary budget** and **Apportionments** budget types.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Other configuration keys might implement additional budgeting features and features that are related to budgeting requirements in specific countries/regions.</P>



To use budget control, you must set up basic budgeting. If you are using the public sector configuration, you set it up at the same time as you set up basic budgeting.

The following sections describe the information that you need to gather before you set up basic budgeting and budget control. These sections also contain links to topics that you can view for additional details.

## Basic budgeting or budget control

Before you set up basic budgeting or budget control, gather the information described in the following table. For more information, see [About basic budgeting and budget control setup](about-basic-budgeting-and-budget-control-setup.md).

## Budget control only

If you use budget control, gather the information in the following table in addition to the information in the previous section. For more information, see [About basic budgeting and budget control setup](about-basic-budgeting-and-budget-control-setup.md).
