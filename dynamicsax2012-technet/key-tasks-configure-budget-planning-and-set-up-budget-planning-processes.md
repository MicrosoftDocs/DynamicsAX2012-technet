# Key tasks: Configure budget planning and set up budget planning processes 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

This topic explains how to configure budget planning and set up budget planning processes. When you configure budget planning, you define elements such as budget plan scenarios and budget planning stages that you use when you set up a budget planning process. When you set up a budget planning process, you combine the budget planning elements into a single process for a budget cycle, ledger, and budget organization hierarchy.

Before you can configure budget planning, you must set up a budget organization hierarchy, budget plan templates, and budgeting workflows. For more information, see [Budget planning overview](budget-planning-overview.md) and [About budget planning configuration and setup](about-budget-planning-configuration-and-setup.md).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The procedure for completing this task changed for cumulative update 7 or later for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2. The updated procedure also applies to AX 2012 R3. For more information, see the section later in this topic.</P>

## Configure budget planning

The key elements that you need to configure for budget planning include:

  - Budget plan scenarios that categorize and contain the data for the lines in the budget plans.

  - Budget planning stages that the budget plans must follow.

  - Budget planning workflows arrange the stages and provide the structure for the access levels and permissions users must have to view and modify budget plan lines.

Additional configurable elements include scenario constraints, allocation schedules and stages, priorities, and locations for attachments and templates. After you configure budget planning, you can set up one or more budget planning processes.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If your organization has workplaces in multiple countries/regions, you can specify translated text for the names and descriptions of scenarios, stages, workflows, and priorities. For more information, see <A href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh697726(v=ax.60)">Text translation (form)</A>.</P>



### Specify budget plan parameters

    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><p>Field</p></th>
    <th><p>Description</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Security model</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>The security for budget plans is determined by the security model that you select for each legal entity in your organization.</p>
    <p>Select from the following options:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Based on worker positions</strong> – All budget plan preparers who are associated with workers whose positions report to an organization unit in the budget planning organization hierarchy can access the budget plans.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Based on security organizations</strong> – All users who are granted access to an organization in the security roles can access the budget plans for that organization. To enable this security model, the organization hierarchy used must have both Security and Budget planning purposes assigned. For more information, see <a href="organization-hierarchies.md">Organization hierarchies</a>, <a href="configure-budget-planning-security.md">Configure budget planning security</a>, and <a href="configuring-budget-planning-for-microsoft-dynamics-ax-2012-r2.md">Configuring Budget Planning for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2</a>.</p></li>

    <td><p>Select this check box if you want to control access to specific budget plans by user group.</p>
    <p>If you select this check box, you’ll specify the user group that can access the budget plan for each budget plan in the <strong>Budget plan</strong> form.</p>
    <p>If you don’t select this option, all users who have access to the <strong>Budget plan</strong> form can access the budget plans based on the security model selection in the <strong>Budget planning configuration</strong> form.</p>
    <div class="alert">

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The user must have access to the responsibility center in the budget planning hierarchy to be able to create a budget plan for this responsibility center. The user can view and edit budget plans if they are part of the user group assigned to the budget plan even if they don’t have access to the budgeting organization hierarchy responsibility center.</P>


    </div></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


3.  To reduce the time that is required to export budget plan lines to Microsoft Excel, select the **Limit the associated budget plan lines to include** check box, and then select the number of levels of child budget plans to include in Excel workbooks. To export all budget plan lines for all child budget plans, clear the **Limit the associated budget plan lines to include** check box.

## Set up budget planning processes

Budget planning processes determine how budget plans can be updated, routed, reviewed, and approved in the budgeting organization hierarchy. After you set up and activate a budget planning process, users can create budget plans and submit them to workflow for updates, reviews, and approvals.

1.  Click **Budgeting** \> **Setup** \> **Budget planning** \> **Budget planning process**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Enter a name and a description for the budget planning process, and then select the budget cycle and ledger.

4.  On the **Template folder** FastTab, select the justification template to use to create justifications for the budget plans that are created by using this budget planning process. Select the attachment folder that you want to use to store the attachments to the budget plans that are created by using this budget planning process.

5.  On the **Budget planning process administration** FastTab, select the budget planning organization hierarchy. Select the budget planning workflow for each responsibility center. To assign a budget planning workflow to similar types of responsibility centers, click **Assign workflow**, and then select the organization type and budget planning workflow.

6.  On the **Budget planning stage rules and templates** FastTab, select a budget planning workflow.

7.  For each budget planning stage, define the following options:
    
      - **Associate budget plans** – Select this check box if budget plans can be associated with a parent budget plan in this planning stage.
    
      - **Add lines** – Select this check box if budget plan lines can be added during this budget planning stage.
    
      - **Modify lines** – Select this check box if budget plan lines can be modified during this budget planning stage.
    
      - **Template** – Select the template to use when you create worksheets for this budget planning stage. Each stage can have a unique worksheet template.
    
    The permissions for the budget planning data is determined by the scenario constraints that you select in the **Budget planning configuration** form, and by whether the **Add lines** and **Modify lines** check boxes are selected for each budget planning stage. For more information, see “Budget planning stage rules and scenario constraints” in [About budget planning configuration and setup](about-budget-planning-configuration-and-setup.md).

8.  On the **Budget plan priority constraints** FastTab, select the priorities that can be assigned to the budget plans in this budget planning process.

9.  When you click **Activate** for the budget planning process, the **State** field value at the top of the form changes from **Draft** to **In process**. Users then can create budget plans by using this budget planning process.

10. After all the budget plans that used this budget planning process are complete, you can click **Complete**. The budget planning process can no longer be used to create budget plans, and the **State** field value changes to **Completed**.
