# About dimension control for time and attendance 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When workers create registrations for time and attendance, for example on a project, a value is also created for each dimension.

The dimension values are defined either for the worker, or for the selected job. In the **Time and attendance - parameters** form, you set up which dimension values to use for various jobs or activities that relate to time and attendance. The following path shows how to open the **Time and attendance - parameters** form. Click **Human resources** \> **Setup** \> **Time and attendance** \> **Time and attendance parameters**.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Dimensions can be defined for different types of jobs or activities, such as projects and indirect activities.</P>
> <P>Dimensions can vary, depending on the types of indirect activities.</P>
> <P>Dimensions can be combined. For example, if no dimension is defined from the job, dimensions from the worker may be used instead.</P>
