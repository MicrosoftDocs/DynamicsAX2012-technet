Quick links Web parts on Role Centers display links that are relevant to users who have a specific role. The links provide access to frequently used forms, reports, list pages, and Web pages.

2.  Select a profile to import or export quick links for.

3.  Click **Import** or **Export**, and then click the AOT option or the file option.
    
      - If you are importing or exporting links for a profile that is on the same computer, click the AOT option.
    
      - If you are importing or exporting links for a profile that is on another computer, click the file option.

4.  Close the form.
