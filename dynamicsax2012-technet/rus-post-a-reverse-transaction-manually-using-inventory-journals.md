5.  On the **General** tab, in the **Return lot ID** field, select the return lot.

    > <P>The return lot is entered in the receipt transaction and allows the receipt cost price of the lot to be determined by the issue cost price of that lot.</P>

7.  Click **Post** to post the journal.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can view the reverse transactions of Inventory transaction in the <STRONG>Posting</STRONG> form. If the Extended Validation parameter in the <STRONG>Inventory Parameters</STRONG> form is activated, during validation using the same financial and inventory dimensions, the reverse transaction is posted in the journal as reversed transactions.</P>
    > <P>If, during validation, the inventory dimensions do not match and therefore the journal posting cannot be performed, an Infolog message will appear. This tool is very convenient when you need to display the original and reversed transactions.</P>
