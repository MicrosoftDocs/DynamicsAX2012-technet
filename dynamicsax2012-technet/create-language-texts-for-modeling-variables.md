[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Modeling variable descriptions or field prompts and help texts can be created in different languages. To do this, take the following steps.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This information applies only to Product builder.</P>



Use this form to create field descriptions and help texts in different languages.

1.  Click **Product information management** \> **Setup** \> **Product builder** \> **Modeling variables**.

2.  Click **Translations**.

3.  In the **Language** field, press CTRL+N to create a prompt text and a help text in a new language.
    
    The field refers to the set of language codes currently defined in the system. For each modeling variable, you can enter language texts in as many languages as you want.

4.  In the **Text** field, type a field prompt text in the selected language. This is the field prompt that will be shown to users during item configuration.

5.  In the **Help text** field, type the language-specific help text that you want to be shown with the prompt text from the **Text** field. During item configuration, this help text will be shown at the bottom of the screen whenever this modeling variable is selected for input.
