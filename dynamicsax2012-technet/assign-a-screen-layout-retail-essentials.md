# Assign a screen layout (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

When you set up Microsoft Dynamics AX for Retail POS registers for Retail essentials, you can specify how the screen appears to your workers. When you set up a register, you select the ID of the screen layout that the register uses. You can also assign screen layouts to specific stores or specific workers. This topic explains how to assign a screen layout to one or more stores, registers, or workers.

When Retail essentials starts, it determines which screen layout to display. For example, you assign one screen layout to a specific store, another layout to a specific register, and another layout to a specific worker. In this case, Retail essentials uses the following order to determine the appropriate layout:

1.  Worker

2.  Register

3.  Store


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Retail essentials, the form that you use to complete this task includes a subset of the controls that are available for other configurations of Retail. If a topic about this form describes controls that you don't see, it may be because you’re using Retail essentials.</P>
