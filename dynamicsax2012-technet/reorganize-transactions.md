# Reorganize transactions 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You or a customer might pay one invoice on multiple dates, or use multiple payment methods, such as a check and cash. In these situations, you can reorganize an invoice into several parts and assign a separate payment method to each part. After you reorganize the invoice, you can settle each new invoice line with a separate payment.

This information describes how to reorganize customer transactions that are in accounts receivable journals and vendor transactions that are in accounts payable journals.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can also reorganize transactions that are in the general journal and in payment journals.</P>



## Reorganize open customer transactions

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Customers** \> **All customers**.

2.  Select an account.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, click the **Collect** tab, and then click **Settle open transactions**.

4.  On the **Overview** tab, select the **Mark** check box for an invoice.

5.  Click **Transaction reorganizing**.

6.  Select whether to reorganize the transaction by percentage or amount.

7.  On the **Overview** tab, create a line for each new due date. For each due date, enter the percentage or amount of the original transaction that is due on that date.
    
    To reorganize the original transaction by method of payment, enter the same due date for each line. You will select the method of payment in step 11.
    

    > [!TIP]
