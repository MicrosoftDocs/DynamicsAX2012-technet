# Define validation connections 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

**This is preliminary documentation and is subject to change.**

You can associate a worker and a project from either the **Worker** form or the **Projects** form. However, the result of adding validation groups from the **Worker** form or the **Projects** form differs depending on the form that you use to add the group. Either a project is made available for a group of workers or a group of projects is made available for one worker.

## For a project

1.  Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Common** \> **Projects** \> **All projects**.

2.  Select a project.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Plan** tab, in the **Validation** group, click either **Assign workers** or **Assign categories**.

4.  In the **Project validation worker assignments** form or **Project validation category assignments** form, select the **Worker** tab or **Categories** tab, depending on the form that you opened.

5.  If you selected **Assign workers** in step 3, select the legal entity from which you want to assign workers.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The <STRONG>Legal entity</STRONG> field is available only if intercompany timesheet support has been enabled for your legal entity.</P>

    
    Â
