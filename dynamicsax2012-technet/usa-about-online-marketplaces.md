# (USA) About online marketplaces 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Organizations can use Microsoft Dynamics AX and Commerce Services for Microsoft Dynamics ERP to sell products easily through several well-known, established online marketplaces.

Catalogs and product listings are centrally managed, and sales orders flow seamlessly back into Microsoft Dynamics AX for processing. For more information about Commerce Services, see [online services for Microsoft Dynamics ERP](http://www.dynamicsonline.com/).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>To sell products through Commerce Services to online marketplaces, you must have a Commerce Services account. Commerce Services accounts are available only in the United States. For information, see <A href="usa-set-up-and-maintain-a-commerce-services-account.md">(USA) Set up and maintain a Commerce Services account</A>.</P>



For information about how to set up Commerce Services, see [(USA) Setting up and maintaining Commerce Services for Microsoft Dynamics ERP](usa-setting-up-and-maintaining-commerce-services-for-microsoft-dynamics-erp.md).
