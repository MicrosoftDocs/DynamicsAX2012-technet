You can use the tools for forecasting cash flow and currency requirements to estimate the company's future need for cash. To obtain a reliable forecast of the cash flow, you must do the following:

  - Identify and list all the liquidity accounts. Liquidity accounts are the company's accounts for cash or cash equivalents.

  - Identify and set up forecasts of transactions that affect the company's liquidity accounts.

You can then calculate, view, and print forecasts of the cash flow. You can also calculate and display currency requirements.

You can use a simple setup for forecasts of the cash flow, or you can use parameters to forecast the cash flow in many areas.
