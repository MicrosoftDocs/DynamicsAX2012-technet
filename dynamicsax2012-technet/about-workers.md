Records for your various types of workers are important to your human resources and payroll systems. The information that you enter can be used to track workers and personal information, to write letters, and to print reports. It is important to keep up-to-date information to reflect the current activities of your workers and of your companies, legal entities, and organizations.There are two worker types: **Employee** and **Contractor**.

You can maintain the following information for workers:

  - Basic – Maintain basic worker information, such as contact information, demographic information, identification information, family information, military service status, expatriate information, and personal and emergency contacts.

  - Employment – Maintain information about workers’ employment, such as company or organization affiliation, position assignment, start and end dates, work eligibility, terms of employment, pension, vacation, and relocation information.
