    <td><p>Select the pay type that is used to register payroll transactions for the debt amount for the employer at the close of the period.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


3.  Click **Calculation calendar**, and then in the **Calculation calendar** area, click **New** to create a record for the calculation date. In the **Calculation date** field, specify a calculation date. This date is available in the list of dates that you can select for a specific payroll period in the **Calculation date** field in the **General** area.

4.  Click **Transaction**, and then in the **Transaction** area, set up the compression level for salary transactions, the default payroll posting profile for accounts, and default payroll posting profiles for offset accounts and deferral accounts.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>

    <td><p>Select the payroll posting profile for the deferral account that is used to update the deferral account information in the payroll transactions that you create.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


5.  Click **Number sequences**, and then in the **Number sequences** area, set up number sequence codes for the following references:
    
      - Journal
    
      - Timesheet number
    
      - Number of pay-sheets
    
      - Deposit card's number
    
      - Earning wages certificate
    
      - NDFL refund offset voucher
    
      - Document number of bank payment

## 2\. Set up payroll groups

Use the **Payroll groups** form to set up codes for payroll groups and assign employees or workers to the groups. These groups are used to differentiate between the calculation methods for employees or workers based on the information, such as position, date of birth, and gender. You can create a payroll group of workers to define parameters that are specific to workers, such as tax residence or citizenships.

To set up payroll groups, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Setup** \> **Payroll groups**.

2.  Click **New** or press CTRL+N to create a payroll group.

3.  In the **Group type** field, select **Worker** or **Employee** as the type of payroll group.

4.  In the **Group** and **Description** fields, enter a name and a description for the payroll group.

5.  Select the **Blocked** check box to indicate that the payroll records of employees or workers in this group must be locked when calculating payroll.

6.  To add employees or workers to the payroll group manually, perform the following steps:
    
    1.  On the **Employees** tab, select the employees or workers to add to the group in the **Remaining employees** list.
    
    2.  Click **\<** to move selected employees or workers. Alternatively, click **\<\<** to move all of the employees or workers.
    
    3.  In the **Period** form, in the **From** and **To** fields, select the starting and ending date for the period for which the employees or workers are added to the payroll group.
    
    4.  Click **OK** to move the selected employees or workers to the **Select employees** list. The number of employees or workers that you move to the **Select employees** list is updated in the **Employees** field on the **Overview** tab.
    
    5.  If required, you can modify the starting and ending date for the period for which an employee or a worker is added to the payroll group after you add the employee or worker to the payroll group. On the **Employees** tab, select the employee or worker in the **Select employees** list, and then modify the starting and ending dates in the **From date** and **To date** fields.
    
    –or–
    
    To add employees or workers to the payroll group using a query, perform the following steps:
    
    1.  Click **Query** \> **Create**, and then specify the criteria to add employees or workers.
    
    2.  Click **OK**, and then click **Yes** to run the query. The employees or workers that match the criteria are added from the **Remaining employees** list to the **Select employees** list on the **Employees** tab. The number of employees or workers that are moved to the **Select employees** list is updated in the **Employees** field on the **Overview** tab. The **Query** check box on the **Overview** tab is selected for the payroll group. A selected check box indicates that the payroll group is created using a query, and that you cannot modify the list of employees or workers in the group manually. You can click **Query** \> **Delete** to delete the query that is attached to a payroll group.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can click <STRONG>Payroll groups</STRONG> on the <STRONG>Payroll</STRONG> tab in the <STRONG>Action pane</STRONG> on the <STRONG>Employees</STRONG> list page to open the <STRONG>Payroll groups</STRONG> form, where you can view the list of groups that an employee or a worker belongs to. You can also assign the employee or worker to another group.</P>



7.  Click **Rates** to open the **Set up rate values** form, where you can set up the salary rates for the payroll group. For more information, see 4. Set up rates based on value type.

You can generate the **Payroll groups** report that contains the details of a selected group of employees or workers. Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Reports** \> **Payroll groups**.

## 3\. Set up rates and dependencies for payroll calculation

Use the **Rates** form to define the values of calculation variables, such as the rate to calculate pension fund contributions or the number of children to calculate the corresponding benefits for. You can use the rates to maintain entity specific attributes, such as tax residence status of a worker, base salary value of a hired employee, hazardous working conditions additional pay value for a single department, or a specific social compensation value that is configured for a group of workers.

To set up rates and dependencies for payroll calculation, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Setup** \> **Calculation** \> **Rates**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a record.

3.  In the **Rate** and **Name** fields, enter an identification code and name for the rate.

4.  In the **Rate type** field, select the type of rate. Use the information in the following table to decide what type of rate to create.

You can also select a list of pay types that are used as limits of calculations, such as the maximum percentage of personal deduction to apply to the net salary of an employee.

  - **Off-budget fund** – This fund defines the tax base that is used to calculate the actual contributions of employees to the off-budget funds.

  - **Basis for calculation** – This fund defines the base for calculation of vacation pay, sick pay, maintenance payments, other payments, and tax and personal deductions. The fund also defines the limit of calculations.

2.  Click **New** or press CTRL+N to create a fund record.
