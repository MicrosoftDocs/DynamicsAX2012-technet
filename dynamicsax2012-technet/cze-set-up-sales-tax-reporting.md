# (CZE) Set up sales tax reporting 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Before you report sales tax transactions for your organization, you can set up the report structure in an XML format. You can modify the XML format for your location. When you export sales tax information and create the sales tax report, you can send the XML file to sales tax authorities.

**Prerequisites**

  - Define parameters to use to calculate sales taxes. For example, define how to calculate tax on cash discounts, overpayments, and corrections. For more information, see [General ledger parameters (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa557286\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Set up sales tax codes to use to calculate the taxes and duties that your organization is obligated to collect from customers and pay to tax authorities. For more information, see [Create various kinds of sales tax codes](create-various-kinds-of-sales-tax-codes.md) and [Set up and use sales tax codes](set-up-and-use-sales-tax-codes.md).
