# About retail stores 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 for Retail supports multiple retail channels, including online stores, online marketplaces, and brick-and-mortar stores. In Retail, a brick-and-mortar store is called a *retail store*. Each retail store can have its own payment methods, price groups, point-of-sale (POS) registers, income accounts and expense accounts, and staff.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 also supports call centers as a type of retail channel. For more information about how to set up call centers, see <A href="set-up-a-call-center.md">Set up a call center</A>.</P>



After you create a retail store, you assign the products that you want the store to carry. You also assign employees, registers, and customers to the store. Finally, you add the new store to an organization hierarchy.

## Setting up retail stores

Before you can set up a retail store, you must complete some prerequisite tasks. After you complete these tasks, you can create a retail store and add details.

## Prerequisites

The following table shows the tasks that you must complete before you can set up a retail store in Microsoft Dynamics AX. The first column in the table describes the task. The second column contains a link to a topic that describes how to complete the task.

## Organization hierarchies

Retail uses organization hierarchies in Microsoft Dynamics AX to structure retail channels. Organization hierarchies represent the relationships between the organizations that make up your business. When you set up stores, you can add them to an organization hierarchy. The stores then share data that is used for assortments, replenishment, and reporting.

When you create an organization hierarchy, you assign a purpose to it. The purpose indicates how the hierarchy is used in the business structure. You can create one organization hierarchy for your store operations, and use that hierarchy for assortments, replenishment, and reporting. Alternatively, you can create a separate organization hierarchy for each purpose. You can also create multiple hierarchies with the same purpose and assign a channel to each of those.

After you set up the organization hierarchy and assign stores to it, you use the hierarchy to determine which stores you can distribute assortments to or replenish stock for. For example, you configure an organization hierarchy and assign a purpose of **Retail assortment** to it. Then, when you must distribute assortments to retail channels, you can select only the retail channels that are included in this organization hierarchy.

For more information about how to set up an organization hierarchy, see [Create or modify an organization hierarchy](create-or-modify-an-organization-hierarchy.md).
