# Match prices for products 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic describes how to match prices for products in a call center. The price matching feature lets call center workers match a competitor's price for a product. To match prices, a worker first creates a sales order that uses the regular price of the product and then invoices the order. After the invoice is created, the worker lowers the price to the requested amount by creating a credit that is applied to the customer's account.

You can set a limit on the amount of the credit that is created for a price match. To limit the credit amount, set the maximum amount for an order credit in the call center parameters.

## Prerequisites

The following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you start.

## 1\. Set order credit parameters

Set the call center parameters that are related to order credits, such as the journal name, offset account, and charges code to use for the price match credit. You can also set the maximum amount that is allowed for order credits.

To set the parameters for order credits, follow these steps.

1.  Click **Call center** \> **Setup** \> **Call center parameters**.

2.  In the left pane, click **Payment**.

3.  On the **Order credits** FastTab, in the **Journal name** field, select an appropriate journal to use for order credits. Right-click the **Journal name** field, and then select **View details**.

4.  In the **Journal names** form, in the **Offset account** field, select an appropriate offset account to use for the order credit. Set the other options for the journal as you require. Close the **Journal names** form.

5.  In the **Call center parameters** form, set the other order credit parameters. For more information about these parameters, see [Set up payment methods (Call center)](set-up-payment-methods-call-center.md).

## 2\. Match prices for products

To match a price for a product, first create a sales order, and invoice the order. Then create a credit to apply to the order. The amount of the credit is the difference between the original price of the product and the lower price that you want to match.

To match prices for a product, follow these steps.

1.  Click **Call center** \> **Common** \> **All sales orders**.

2.  Create a sales order, enter payment information, complete the order, and invoice the order.

3.  In the **Sales order** form, on the **Sales order lines** FastTab, click **Update line**, and then click **Price match**.

4.  In the **Price match** form, in the **New price** field, enter the new price for the product. The **Credit amount** field displays the amount of the credit, or the difference between the current price and the new price.

5.  In the **Reason code** field, select a reason code to use for the credit.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>For more information about how to set up reason codes that you can use for order credits, see <A href="set-up-info-codes.md">Set up info codes</A>.</P>



6.  Select the **Credit to account** check box to credit the customer's account. If this check box is cleared, you can issue the credit by using any other payment method that the call center supports.

7.  On the **Action Pane**, click **OK** to process the credit.
