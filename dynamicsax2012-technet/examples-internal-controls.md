# Examples: Internal controls 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

These examples explain how to manually set up and use internal controls in the purchasing department of a global organization named Fabrikam. Specifically, the internal control is designed to show that the same user is not able to approve vendor invoices and then approve the corresponding vendor payments. Chris, an information technology engineer, and Phyllis, the accounting manager, work together to add information to the **Compliance** site.

For information about how to import internal controls from a Microsoft Excel workbook, see [Import internal controls to the Compliance site](import-internal-controls-to-the-compliance-site.md).

## Set up the Internal controls site structure

1.  Chris clicks **Compliance** on the top link bar, and then clicks **Set up control environment** on the Quick Launch.

2.  On the **Set up control environment** page, Chris sets up the following site structure.
    
    **Operations - Domestic**
    
      - **Purchasing - Domestic**
    
      - **Sales - Domestic**

3.  Chris selects the **Purchasing - Domestic** node and adds Phyllis as a user who has **Add/Copy** permissions.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>For detailed steps, see <A href="set-up-the-internal-controls-site.md">Set up the Internal controls site</A>.</P>



4.  Chris clicks **Save**.

## Create a significant account

A significant account corresponds to a ledger account in a chart of accounts. In this example, the significant account is the “Cash” account.

1.  Phyllis clicks **Compliance** on the top link bar, and then clicks **Internal controls** on the Quick Launch.

2.  On the **Internal controls** page, Phyllis clicks **Purchasing - Domestic**.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, in the **New** group, Phyllis clicks **Add document**.

4.  Phyllis creates a significant account named “Cash.”
    
    1.  In the **Name** field, Phyllis enters **Cash**.
    
    2.  In the **Template** list, Phyllis selects **Significant Account**.
    
    3.  Phyllis clicks **Create**.

## Create a process

A process is a prescribed way that an organization accomplishes a series of steps. In the context of the **Internal controls** site, Phyllis creates a compliance process document to prove that the process has been reviewed and that it is working effectively. In this example, the process is “Pay vendor invoices.”

1.  Phyllis clicks **Compliance** on the top link bar, and then clicks **Internal controls** on the Quick Launch.

2.  On the **Internal controls** page, Phyllis clicks the **Cash** significant account.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, in the **New** group, Phyllis clicks **Add document**.

4.  Phyllis creates a process named ”Pay vendor invoices.”
    
    1.  In the **Name** field, Phyllis enters **Pay vendor invoices**.
    
    2.  In the **Template** list, Phyllis selects **Process**.
    
    3.  Phyllis clicks **Create and edit**.

5.  On the **Edit document** page, in the **Owner** field, Phyllis enters the compliance owner. This is the person who signs off to confirm that this process is working correctly. Use the following format: domain\\alias
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The users in the <STRONG>Owner</STRONG> fields must be set up as users on the Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX SharePoint site.</P>



6.  Phyllis clicks the **Validate user** icon.

7.  In the **Process Owner** and **Transaction Type** fields, Phyllis can set properties for the compliance document. These properties are displayed on control reports.

8.  Phyllis assigns compliance workflow steps to users.
    
    1.  In the **Workflow** section, under **1. Review**, Phyllis clicks the **Edit line** icon.
    
    2.  In the **Assigned to** column, Phyllis enters the user who is responsible for reviewing the process, and then clicks the **Validate user** icon.
        

        > [!NOTE]
        > <P>The users in the <STRONG>Assigned to</STRONG> fields must be set up as users on the Enterprise Portal SharePoint site.</P>

    
    3.  Phyllis clicks the **Update line** icon.
    
    4.  Under **2. Sign-off**, Phyllis clicks the **Edit line** icon.
    
    5.  In the **Assigned to** column, Phyllis enters the user who is responsible for verifying that the compliance review is complete, and then clicks the **Validate user** icon.
    
    6.  Phyllis clicks the **Update line** icon.

## Report an issue and upload evidence

An issue identifies a problem with a control. For example, if the **Segregation of duty conflicts** form reveals that the same user is assigned to both the “Approve vendor invoices” and “Approve vendor payments” duties, Phyllis might change the duty assignments. She could then view the **Segregation of duty conflicts** form again and upload a screen capture of it as evidence that the issue has been resolved. This example assumes that a screen capture has been saved as a graphics file and is uploaded to a secure location on Fabrikam’s intranet.

1.  Phyllis clicks **Compliance** on the top link bar, and then clicks **Internal controls** on the Quick Launch.

2.  On the **Internal controls** page, Phyllis clicks the **Segregation of duty rule for vendor invoices and payments** control.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, in the **New** group, Phyllis clicks **Add document**.

4.  Phyllis creates an issue named “User is assigned to both the Approve vendor invoices and Approve vendor payments duties.”
    
    1.  In the **Name** field, Phyllis enters **User is assigned to both the Approve vendor invoices and Approve vendor payments duties**.
    
    2.  In the **Template** list, Phyllis selects **Issue**.
    
    3.  Phyllis clicks **Create and edit**.

5.  On the **Edit document** page, in the **Owner** field, Phyllis enters the compliance owner for this issue and then clicks the **Validate user** icon.

6.  Phyllis resolves the issue.
    
    1.  In the **Workflow** section, under **1. Resolve**, Phyllis clicks the **Edit line** icon.
    
    2.  In the **Complete** column, Phyllis selects the check box.
    
    3.  In the **Assigned to** column, Phyllis enters the user who resolved the issue, and then clicks the **Validate user** icon.
    
    4.  Phyllis clicks the **Update line** icon.

7.  Phyllis adds evidence to prove that the issue has been resolved.
    
    1.  Phyllis clicks the **Add evidence via URL** link.
    
    2.  In the **URL** column, Phyllis enters or pastes the location of the saved graphic.
        

        > [!NOTE]
        > <P>The URL must contain http://, https://, or ftp:// to be an active link.</P>

    
    3.  Phyllis clicks the **Update line** icon.
