# (POL) Post an internal invoice 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

An internal invoice documents how taxes are calculated for purchases that are made within the European Union (EU). The internal invoice is a tax calculation document that is separate from the vendor invoice. You can create one EU internal invoice for multiple transactions or you can create an EU invoice for each transaction.

Before you can post an internal invoice for a transaction that occurred within the EU, you must create a vendor record and an item sales tax group. You can then create a purchase order and post the invoice.
