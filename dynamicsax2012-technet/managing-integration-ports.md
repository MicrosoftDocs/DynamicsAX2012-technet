# Managing integration ports [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In Application Integration Framework (AIF), you follow these steps to set up and manage a message exchange that uses integration ports:

1.  [Create, edit, or delete an enhanced integration port](create-edit-or-delete-an-enhanced-integration-port.md).

2.  [Configure addresses for enhanced integration ports](configure-addresses-for-enhanced-integration-ports.md). As part of this step, you specify the transport adapters that are used, and you also provide the URIs that are used to access the ports.

3.  [Customize service contracts](customize-service-contracts.md). As part of this step, you expose service operations and configure data policies for document exchanges.

4.  [Configure processing options](configure-processing-options.md). As part of this step, you configure transforms and pipelines, apply value maps, and specify other processing behavior, such as the responses to errors.

5.  [Configure troubleshooting options for integration ports](configure-troubleshooting-options-for-integration-ports.md).

6.  [Configure security for integration ports](configure-security-for-integration-ports.md). As part of this step, you configure company restrictions and rules for users. These users include trusted intermediary users.

## Other AIF settings

You can use the following forms when you configure a data exchange:

  - Use the **Value substitution maps** form to set up an optional predefined value mapping that is available for certain documents.

  - Use the **Web sites** form to set up a Web site that can be used together with the HTTP adapter.
