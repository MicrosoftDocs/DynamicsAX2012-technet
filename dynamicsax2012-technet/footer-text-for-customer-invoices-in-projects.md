# Footer text for customer invoices in projects 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use the **Print management setup** form to specify the text that is printed in the footer of a customer invoice for a project. The footer text for the original invoice can be different from the footer text for copies of the invoice. For example, the footer text in the original customer invoice might be "Department Copy," whereas the footer text in the copy that you send to the customer might be "Customer Copy."

Footer text is printed on all pages of a document. If no footer text is entered, the footer is blank.

1.  Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Setup** \> **Forms** \> **Form setup**.

2.  Click **General**, and then click **Print management**.

3.  In the **Print management setup** form, in the left pane, expand the **Project invoice** node, and then select a record.

4.  On the right side of the form, in the **Footer text** field, enter the text that you want to appear in the footer.
    

    > [!TIP]
    > <P>Click the browse button next to the <STRONG>Footer text</STRONG> field to open the <STRONG>Footer text</STRONG> form, where you can select existing text that has been stored in the <STRONG>Footer text</STRONG> form.</P>
