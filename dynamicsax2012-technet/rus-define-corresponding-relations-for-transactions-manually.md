# (RUS) Define corresponding relations for transactions manually 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use the manual transaction correspondence function to define a relationship between non-corresponding transactions. When the account correspondence mechanism is turned off in the ledger, all transactions are generated normally. No correspondence link is established between accounts. The function is not retroactive. When correspondence is turned back on, correspondence will not be established for transactions that were performed earlier.
