# (BRA) Set up an electronic payment 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can set up electronic payments for vendors and customers. You can set up document types, instruction codes, bank folders, remittance occurrence codes, and return occurrence codes for a layout group. You can then use the layout group for the electronic file format that is used by your bank for export and return.

## Set up an export file and a return file layout

You must set up the configurator definition group, layout group, and methods of payment for customers and vendors before you set up electronic payments for export and return. To set up an export file and return file layouts, follow these steps.

1.  Use the **Configurator definition groups** form to set up a configurator definition group for export files and return files. You can create a configurator definition based on a predefined query, or you can create a configurator definition group in the Definition Group Wizard. For more information, see [(BRA) Set up the configurator definition group](bra-set-up-the-configurator-definition-group.md).

2.  Use the **Configurator layout groups** form to set up a configurator layout group for export and return files, and then attach a configurator definition group to the layout group. For more information, see [(BRA) Set up the configurator layout group](bra-set-up-the-configurator-layout-group.md)

3.  Use the **Methods of payment - vendors** or **Methods of payment - customers** form to set up electronic methods of payment for vendors or customers. For more information, see [(BRA) Set up an electronic method of payment](bra-set-up-an-electronic-method-of-payment.md).
