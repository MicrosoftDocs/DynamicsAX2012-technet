# About project budgets and forecasts 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Microsoft Dynamics AX provides two ways to manage and control your projects: project forecasts and project budgets.

You can use forecasting if your organization has an operational perspective and focuses on revenues and costs derived from specific transactions. You can use budgeting if your organization focuses more on the financial amounts.

Both methods have their advantages. We recommend that your organization consider the following points before selecting a method.

</tr>
<tr class="odd">

## Forecast models

Both project forecasts and project budgets use forecast models to contain the projected transaction amounts. The forecast models are created in the **Forecast models** form.

Forecast models have a single-layer hierarchy, which means that one project forecast must be associated with one forecast model. If you use project forecasting, you can identify models as submodels, which lets you create forecasts by department, time period, or region. For example, a forecast model could be created for a year, and then submodels could be created for the Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, and Southwest region forecasts that are submitted by regional heads. By choosing different options in Microsoft Dynamics AX reports, you can view information by total forecast or by submodel.

Project budgets must be associated with an original budget forecast model and a remaining budget forecast model. Project budgets can also be associated with a carry-forward budget model if you have projects that extend over one year and carry forward remaining budget amounts at year-end to the following year. When the original budget for a project is approved, forecast transactions are created automatically, based on the associated original budget model and remaining budget model.
