When you credit the vendor account and debit the ledger account, the excise amounts calculated are debited to the accounts as defined in the **Tax ledger posting groups** form for the ECC number.

The ledger accounts that are debited with the excise amounts depend on the excise record type you select in the **Excise record type** field in the **Journal voucher** form.

To update the excise register on the date the invoice is posted, you must select the **Delivery date** or **Invoice date** in the **Vendor calculation date type** field in the **General ledger parameters** form. If you select the **Document date** option, the excise register is updated on the document date. If the document date is not set, then the registers are updated on the date the invoice is posted on.
