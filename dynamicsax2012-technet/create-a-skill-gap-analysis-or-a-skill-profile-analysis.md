# Create a skill gap analysis or a skill profile analysis 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use skill gap analysis to compare a person’s skill profile with a profile for a particular job as of a particular date.

You can use a skill profile analysis to see a list of a person’s kills and to see a skill wheel that graphically represents a person’s actual skill levels compared to target skill levels.

For more information about skills and skill profiles, see [About skills](about-skills.md).
