You can use skill gap analysis to compare a person’s skill profile with a profile for a particular job as of a particular date.

You can use a skill profile analysis to see a list of a person’s kills and to see a skill wheel that graphically represents a person’s actual skill levels compared to target skill levels.

For more information about skills and skill profiles, see [About skills](about-skills.md).
