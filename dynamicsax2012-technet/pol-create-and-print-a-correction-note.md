# (POL) Create and print a correction note 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

A correction note is a document that you can use to notify a vendor about errors in the document header of a purchase document. For example, a vendor may issue a sales document that has an incorrect address or value-added tax (VAT) identification number. You can accept and post the document as a purchase invoice, and then issue a correction note to the vendor later. The correction note should describe the error and provide the correct data.

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Inquiries** \> **Journals** \> **Invoice journal**. Select the invoice that contains incorrect data, and then click **Create correction notes.**.

2.  In the **Correction notes** form, in the **Document date** field, enter the transaction date. If you do not enter a date, the current date is used for the posting date.

3.  In the **Correction note** field, enter a unique identification number for the correction note.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can generate correction note numbers automatically by setting up a number sequence code for correction note references. Set up number sequences in the <STRONG>Accounts payable parameters</STRONG> form.</P>



4.  On the **Details** tab, in the **Original text** field, enter the text from the original document that you are correcting.

5.  In the **Corrected text** field, enter the correct text.

6.  Click **Post** to post the document.

7.  Click **Print** to print the report.
