In some cases, you may have to reverse a completed inventory recalculation. When you reverse an inventory recalculation, adjustments return to the state that they were in before the adjustments were made.

1.  In the **Closing and adjustment** form, on the **Overview** tab, select the record of the inventory recalculation that you want to reverse.

2.  Click **Cancellation** to open the **Cancelation - initialize** form.

3.  Set the options to cancel one voucher or all recalculations.

4.  Click **OK**.
