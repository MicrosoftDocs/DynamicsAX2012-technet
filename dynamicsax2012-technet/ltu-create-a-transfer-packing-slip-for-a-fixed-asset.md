# (LTU) Create a transfer packing slip for a fixed asset [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

If your organization must move a fixed asset from one department to another and the two departments are not in the same location, the transfer must be verified by a packing slip. You must also generate a transfer packing slip if the employee responsible for the fixed asset is changed. Depending on the parameters that are enabled, the packing slip can be numbered automatically or manually.

1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Common** \> **Fixed assets** \> **Fixed assets**.

2.  Select the fixed asset for transfer, and then on the **Action Pane**, in the **Transfers** group, click **Transfer fixed asset**.

3.  In the **Fixed asset transfer** form, on the **Value models** tab, select the fixed asset value models to include in the transfer.

4.  In the **Transfer date** field, enter the date on which the fixed asset value models will be transferred.

5.  If appropriate, select the financial dimensions or accounts that the fixed assets will be transferred to.
    
    For more information about the **Value models** tab, see [Transfer fixed assets](transfer-fixed-assets.md)

6.  On the **Packing slip details** tab, select the **Packing slip** check box to generate a packing slip for the fixed asset transfer.

7.  In the **Replace with** field group, update the employee responsible, the location, and the department for the fixed asset as appropriate.

8.  If your organization enters packing slip numbers manually, in the **Packing slip** field, enter the new packing slip number, and then click **Update**.
