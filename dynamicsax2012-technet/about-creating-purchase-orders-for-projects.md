# About creating purchase orders for projects 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use one of three methods to create a purchase order in Project management and accounting.

## Methods for creating a purchase order

The purpose of the purchase order determines when the purchase order is consumed and therefore, when items are charged on a project.

<ul>
<li><p>From the project itself. In this case the project is already defined for the purchase order.</p></li>
<li><p>By navigating to the project purchase order. (Click <strong>Project management and accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Common</strong> &gt; <strong>Item tasks</strong> &gt; <strong>Project purchase orders</strong>.) You must select both the vendor and the project for which the purchase order is to be created.</p></li>
</ul></td>
<td><p>Items are consumed when the vendor invoice is updated.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Create a purchase order from a sales order</p></td>
<td><p>Use this method if you want to purchase items when you create a sales order from a project.</p></td>
<td><p>Items are consumed when the sales order is invoiced to the customer.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Create a purchase order from an item requirement</p></td>
<td><p>Use this method if you want to purchase items when you create an item requirement from a project.</p></td>
<td><p>Items are consumed when the item-requirement packing slip is updated.</p></td>
</tr>

> [!NOTE]
> <P>When you update the vendor invoice or packing slip, you are prompted to update the packing slip on the item requirement.</P>



## Invoicing purchase orders in Project management and accounting

The line property that is attached to a purchase order line for an item determines whether the purchased item is invoiced to a customer. There are two invoicing options:

  - If you do not want to invoice the customer, and a non-chargeable line property is attached to the purchase order line, the purchase order is invoiced and no further action is necessary.

  - If you want to invoice the customer, and a chargeable line property is attached to the purchase order line, you must update the vendor invoice and invoice the customer by using the invoicing system in the **Project management and accounting** module.
