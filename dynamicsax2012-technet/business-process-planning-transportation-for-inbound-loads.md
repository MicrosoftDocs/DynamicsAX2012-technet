_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

When you order items from a vendor for delivery to your warehouse, you might want to arrange the transport of the items yourself. This topic provides an overview of how to use Microsoft Dynamics AX to plan the transportation and the receipt of the inbound load.

The following illustration shows the business process flow for planning transportation for an inbound load. The numbers correspond to the tasks that are described later in this topic.
