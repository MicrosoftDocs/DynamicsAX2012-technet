# Set up a transportation tender 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

A transportation tender is a shipping document that has an assignment for a load, a route, or part of a route. You can use this document to keep track of the dates and rates that are approved between the customer and a shipping carrier.

## Set up a transportation tender

You can create a transportation tender from a route, a route segment, or from a load on a route segment. You can also create and update these documents in the **Transportation tenders** form. The following steps describe how to complete the setup in the **Transportation tenders** form. For an overview of additional setup options, see the “Create or update transportation tenders from a route, route segment, or load” section later in this topic.

To set up a transportation tender, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Transportation management** \> **Inquiries** \> **Transportation tenders**.

2.  In the **Filter by** field, select one of the following options to indicate the type of assignment that is requested.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><p>Option</p></th>
    <th><p>Description</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Load</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>The pickup of a specific load.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Route</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>A load to be transported using a route.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Route segment</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>A load to be transported using part of a route.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Route segment for a load</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>A specific load to be transported using part of a route.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


3.  Click **New** to create a new transportation tender. The tender document automatically displays an ID in the **Transportation order** field.

4.  In the **Reference ID** field, select a unique ID for the load. The loads are filtered according to your selection in the **Filter by** field.

5.  On the **General** tab, in the **Shipping carrier** field, select the shipping carrier that should pick up the load.

6.  In the **Carrier service** field, select a service that is offered by the carrier.

7.  Enter the remaining information in the **Shipping** field group.

8.  In the **Rates** field group, enter the date and rate request for the carrier. The **Requested pickup date and time** and the **Requested rates** fields are for the customer request. If the carrier wants to update the information before confirmation, this information must be entered in the **Confirmed pickup date and time** and the **Confirmed rates** fields. You can view the exchange of information between the customer and the carrier on the **History** FastTab.
