# (LVA) View internal transfers of fixed assets 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

When you transfer a fixed asset within your organization, a new line that contains the transfer information is added in the **Fixed asset internal transfer history** form. An internal transfer is generated by changing the location, department, or employee who is responsible for the fixed asset. You can view the history of internal transfers for a fixed asset, including the specific changes that were made, in the **Fixed asset internal transfer history** form.

1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Common** \> **Fixed assets** \> **Fixed assets**.

2.  Select the fixed asset record for which you want to review the history of internal transfers.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, in the **Transfers** group, click **Internal transfer history**.

4.  Click **Print** \> **Internal transfer statement** to print a statement of the internal transfer history for the selected fixed asset.
