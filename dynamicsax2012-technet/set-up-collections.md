If no default aging period definition is specified, the first aging period definition in the **Aging period definitions** form is used.

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Collections** \> **Aging period definitions**.

2.  Enter a name for the aging period definition.

3.  On the **Periods** FastTab, create aging periods. For more information, see [Aging period definitions (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa634713\(v=ax.60\)).

4.  Close the form.

## Create an aging snapshot

Create aging snapshot records for all customers or for the customers in a customer pool. Aging snapshot information is shown on the **Collections** list page and in the **Collections** form. You must create an aging snapshot before you can use the list page. The list page shows information only for customers for whom an aging snapshot has been created. For more information, see [Customer aging snapshot (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh242719\(v=ax.60\)).
