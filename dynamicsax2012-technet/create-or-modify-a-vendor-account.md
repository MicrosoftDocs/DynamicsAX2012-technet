## Create a vendor account

2.  On the **Action Pane**, in the **New** group, click **Vendor**.

3.  On the **New vendor** page, on the **General** FastTab, do the following:
    
    1.  In the **Group** field, select a vendor group. Vendors in a vendor group have common characteristics, such as payment terms, settle period, and sales tax group.
    
    2.  In the **Record type** field, select whether the vendor is a person or an organization.
    
    3.  In the **Name** field, enter a unique name for the vendor. This name is printed on documents that you send to the vendor, such as invoices and statements.
    
    4.  In the **Search name** field, enter a short name for the vendor. This name is used when you search for vendor data. If you do not enter a search name, the value in the **Name** field is used when you search for vendor data.
    
    5.  In the **Address books** field, select the legal entities that this vendor is approved to do business with.
    
    6.  In the **Language** field, select the language that is used for external documents that are sent to the vendor, such as purchase orders.

4.  On the **Address** FastTab, click **Add**, and then enter address information for the vendor.

5.  On the **Contact information** FastTab, click **Add**, and then enter information about contacts at the vendor organization.

6.  On the **Details** FastTab, do the following:
    
    1.  In the **Currency** field, select the currency that is used for vendor invoices.
    
    2.  In the **Vendor hold** field, select the transaction types, if any, that have been placed on hold for the vendor account:
        
          - **No** – No holds have placed on the vendor.
        
          - **Invoice** – No invoices can be created or posted for the vendor.
        
          - **All** – The vendor is on hold for all transaction types.
        
          - **Payment** – No payments can be generated for this vendor.
        
          - **Requisition** – No purchase requisitions can be created for this vendor.
        
          - **Never** – The vendor cannot automatically be put on hold for inactivity.
    
    3.  In the **Buyer group** field, select a buyer group for the vendor. The buyer group defines the group of purchasing agents in your organization who can interact with the vendor.

7.  On the remaining FastTabs, enter information about the new vendor, as applicable.
