# Troubleshooting Report Definition Issues 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The first step to troubleshooting a report issue is to identify the underlying cause for it. This topic describes common issues that may occur when you are defining a Microsoft Dynamics AX report. For SQL Server Reporting Services report troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting Report Problems](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=200936%26clcid=0x409).

The following table provides guidance to help you determine the cause of your report issue.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Issue</p></th>
<th><p>Additional information for troubleshooting</p></th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>The report is broken for any reason and the data source is a query.</p></td>
<td><p>Execute the query outside of the report. Confirm that the query returns expected results. Use a form, job, or Query Services to test the query. For more information, see <a href="query-service.md">Query Service</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>The report is broken and the data source is a report data provider (RDP) class.</p></td>
<td><p>Debug the class. For more information, see <a href="how-to-configure-the-debugger-to-debug-a-report-data-provider-class.md">How to: Configure the Debugger to Debug a Report Data Provider Class</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>When you preview the report you receive the following error:</p>
<p>No report data table with name &lt;dataset table name&gt; exists in report schema for data provider &lt;RDP name&gt;.</p></td>
<td><p>Verify that the report is bound to tables that exist and do not bind multiple datasets to a single report data provider class. Instead, define the report to have the multiple tables pointing to the same dataset.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">

<td><p>When running a report that uses an enumeration value as a multi-value parameter of a report, you get an error like the following:</p>
<p>The ‘ParameterName’ parameter is missing a value.</p></td>
<td><p>Set the <strong>Data Type</strong> property of the enumeration parameter to <strong>Integer</strong>.</p>
<p>This is because the label value of enumeration items are converted to name values in the SrsReportDataContractUIBuilder.getMultiSelectFromDialogField method.</p></td>

<p>Verify that you did not set the <strong>Allow Blank</strong> property to <strong>True</strong> to make the parameter optional. This is not supported for dataset bound parameters by the reporting framework. The following items identify the alternative approaches for OLTP and OLAP reports:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>OLTP reports – use an extended data type (EDT) to add a null-value string variable to the drop-down list as a default. When running the report, you can set the parameter value to NULL by not selecting anything from the drop-down list.</p></li>
<li><p>OLAP reports – add a value <strong>All</strong> to the drop-down list to indicate that no filtering is to be done by the parameter.</p></li>
