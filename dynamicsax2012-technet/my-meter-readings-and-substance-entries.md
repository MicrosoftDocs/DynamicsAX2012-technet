After a worker in your organization has been assigned the task of entering periodic meter readings or substance flow amounts in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client, the worker can create new entries or view previous entries in Enterprise Portal. When a worker opens the **My substance entry** or **My meter readings** page, the worker sees only the meters or substances that are assigned to him or her, with the default settings entered.

## Enter or view substance entries

1.  On the top link bar, click **Compliance**, and then on the Quick Launch, under **Environmental sustainability**, click **My substance entry**.

2.  In the **My substance entry** page, in the **My substance entry** pane, enter the amount in the **Quantity** field for the appropriate substance and, if necessary, change the flow units or the beginning or ending date or time.
