# Cost accounting 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Cost accounting is the process of tracking, recording, and analyzing costs associated with the products or activities of an organization. It can include tracking and managing costs for inventory, manufacturing products, finished goods and overhead.

With Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can use the following different costing methods:

1.  Normal costing

2.  Standard costing

3.  Absorption costing

There are settings on production orders that influence how production estimates and production costing will be performed, and the inventory movement valuations.

The following production entities are used to calculate costs:

  - BOM calculations are used to determine the raw material items used to create a finished product, and to add up or roll up the total material costs.

  - Routes provide the operations, labor, and resources required to produce a given product, and are used to calculate labor costs and manufacturing overhead.

  - The costing sheet is used to build cost groups.
