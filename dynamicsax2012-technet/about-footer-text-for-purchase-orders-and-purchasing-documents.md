# About footer text for purchase orders and purchasing documents 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use the **Print management setup** form to specify the text that is printed in the footer of the original version and on other copies of purchasing documents.

For example, when you print an original purchase order for the accounts payable department, "Accounts Payable Copy" can be printed in the footer. For a copy that is routed to the warehouse, "Warehouse Copy" can be printed in the footer.

You can specify footer text for the following purchasing documents:

  - **Purchase agreement confirmation**

  - **Purchase order product receipt**

  - **Purchase order receipts list**

  - **Purchase order**

  - **Request for quotation - accept**

  - **Request for quotation - reject**

  - **Request for quotation - return**

  - **Request for quotation**

  - **Vendor invoice**

Footer text is printed on all pages of a document. For example, if the original document has two pages, the footer text is printed on both pages. If no footer text is specified, the footers are blank.
