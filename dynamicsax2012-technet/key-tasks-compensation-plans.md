## Create a fixed compensation plan

Use one of the following procedures to set up a fixed compensation plan.

## Create a fixed compensation plan using the Fixed compensation plan form

Use this procedure if you do not use a compensation system that is external to Microsoft Dynamics AX.

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Periodic** \> **Compensation** \> **Fixed compensation plans**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  In the **Type** field, select **Band**, **Grade**, or **Step** type.

4.  If you selected **Band** in the previous step, you can select the **Market price indicator** check box to use the market price ranges that are entered for each job, in addition to the broad compensation ranges that are entered for this compensation plan.

5.  Select an option in the **Out of range tolerance** field to indicate how restrictions on manual pay rate changes should be handled.

6.  Select the **Enable recommendation** check box to enable a manager or a compensation administrator to suggest changes to the guideline amounts that are calculated for the plan.

7.  Select **Percent** in the **Hire rule** field to indicate if prorated pay should be used for employees that are hired during the compensation cycle.

8.  Optional: To transition employees toward the control point for their jobs, on the **Range utilization matrix** tab, add steps for a range utilization matrix. For more information, see [About compensation plans](about-compensation-plans.md).

9.  Press CTRL+S.

10. Click **Set up compensation** to open the **Set up compensation** form, where you can select one of the following options:
    
      - **Set up new compensation matrix** – Select a reference point setup. The reference point setup that you select determines the compensation structure for the fixed compensation plan.
    
      - **Create new from existing compensation matrix** – Copy an existing compensation structure that was created for another plan.
        
        For example, suppose that employees who are located in compensation region A should be paid 10 percent more than those in compensation region B. You would create a plan for the compensation region A employees, and then select **Create new from existing compensation matrix** when you create the plan for the compensation region B employees. You can then modify the compensation structure of the copied plan by 10 percent.
    
      - **Use existing compensation matrix** – Use the same compensation structure as a plan that already exists.
        

        > [!NOTE]
        > <P>Any changes that you make to the wage levels that are in the compensation structure are reflected in any other compensation plan setup where this compensation structure is used.</P>



11. After you select an option in the **Set up compensation** form, click **OK** to open the **Compensation structure** form, where you can review the levels and wage ranges for the compensation structure lines.

12. Adjust the levels and wage ranges, as necessary, and then close the **Compensation structure** form. To adjust multiple values in the grid at the same time:
    
    1.  Click the **Mass change** button.
    
    2.  Select an **Adjustment type**.
    
    3.  Enter an **Adjustment amount**.
    
    4.  Click **Apply to grid**.
    
    5.  Click **Close** to save the values in the grid.
        

        > [!TIP]
        > <P>For more information, see <A href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh803022(v=ax.60)">Compensation structure (form)</A>.</P>



13. Click the **General** tab in the **Fixed compensation plans** form, and select a control point in the **Control point** field. The control point is the target pay rate for a job that is covered by the current plan and comes from the reference point setup.

14. Enter information in the remaining fields, as needed. For more information, see [Fixed compensation plans (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh242871\(v=ax.60\)).

## Create a fixed compensation structure using the Compensation grid form

If your company uses external compensation systems, you can use the **Compensation grids** form to set up basic compensation structures.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Compensation structures that are created in the <STRONG>Fixed compensation plans</STRONG> form are automatically copied to the <STRONG>Compensation grids</STRONG> form. However, a compensation structure that is created in the <STRONG>Compensation grids</STRONG> form is not copied to the <STRONG>Fixed compensation plans</STRONG> form.</P>



1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Setup** \> **Compensation** \> **Compensation grids**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Enter a name and a description for the grid.

4.  In the **Type** field, select the compensation level type for the structure.

5.  Select the reference point setup for the structure. The reference points included in the reference point setup determine the ranges that you can use to set up wage range guidelines for each level in the structure.

6.  Select the currency for the structure.

7.  Enter the effective and expiration dates for the structure.

8.  Click **Compensation structure** to open the **Compensation structure** form, where you can modify the wage range guidelines for the structure. For more information, see [Compensation structure (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh803022\(v=ax.60\)).

      - **Percent of basis** – Select this option to determine the variable award based on a percentage of the base pay.
    
      - **Number of units** – Select this option to use a specific variable award amount. For example, select this option to award a specific monetary amount or a specific number of shares of stock.

7.  If you selected **Number of units** in the previous step, enter the number of units to award.
    
    If you selected **Percent of basis** and the compensation plan type is a cash plan type, go to step 11.
    
    If you selected **Percent of basis** and the compensation plan type is a non-cash plan type, go to the next step.

8.  If one award unit is equal to the value of one unit of the currency that you use to pay the employees who will be enrolled in the plan, select the **1:1 relationship** check box.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>For cash plans that have a specific variable amount, this check box is automatically selected and you cannot modify it.</P>



9.  Enter the currency in which the unit is valued. This field is required for stock awards if you did not select the **1:1 relationship** check box.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Cash awards are based on the currency in which fixed compensation is paid.</P>

18. Select one of the following calculation methods for the plan:
    
      - **Composite** – Prorates all changes in compensation for the employee for the compensation cycle when an award amount is calculated.
    
      - **Point-in-time** – Uses compensation information that is active at a specific point in time only.
