This topic explains how to set up a quantity discount. A quantity discount is a discount that is given to customers when they purchase a particular quantity of a product.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Retail essentials, the form that you use to complete this task includes a subset of the controls that are available for other configurations of Retail. If a topic about this form describes controls that you don't see, it may be because youâ€™re using Retail essentials.</P>



1.  Click **Retail essentials** \> **Merchandising** \> **Pricing and discounts** \> **Quantity discounts**.

2.  Click **New** to create a new quantity discount.
    

    > [!TIP]
    > <P>To create a new discount that resembles an existing discount, you can save time by clicking <STRONG>Copy from</STRONG>. All the settings and products are then copied from one discount to the other.</P>



3.  Enter an ID number and a name for the discount. If number sequences are set up, the discount ID is entered automatically.

4.  On the **General** FastTab, in the **Status** field, select **Enabled** or **Disabled** to enable or disable the discount.
    

    > [!NOTE]

    In the **Bar code** field, a bar code is automatically generated for the discount code. The discount is applied to a purchase only if this bar code is entered or scanned in the point of sale (POS) system.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>For promotions, if you enter a value in the <STRONG>Discount code</STRONG> field, the value that you enter is the discount code that is published to the customer. Leave this field blank to use number sequences and bar codes to automatically generate a discount code that is published to the customer.</P>

    The value that you enter in this field depends on the value that you select in the **Discount type** field on the **Price/discount** FastTab of the **Quantity discounts** form.
