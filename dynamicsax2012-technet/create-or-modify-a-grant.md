# Create or modify a grant 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A grant is a gift of money for a specific purpose or project. Usually, there are restrictions on how a grant can be spent. In **Project management and accounting**, you can enter and track grants and define their relationships to projects and project contracts. For example, you can:

  - Associate grants with projects and funding sources through links to the **Project** form and **Project contract details** form.

  - Enter and track changes to a grant as it transitions from one status to another.

  - Enter and track costs, requested amounts, and awarded amounts.

  - Create master grants and associate subgrants with them.

You can create a grant by entering all of the details into a new record, or you can copy and modify the details from an existing grant.

## Create a new grant and enter the details

1.  Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Common** \> **Grants** \> **Grants**.

2.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Grant** tab, in the **New** group, click **Grant**.

3.  In the **Grant details** form, on the **General** FastTab, in the **Grant ID** field, enter an alphanumeric identifier for the grant.

4.  In the **Grant name** field, enter a name for the grant.

5.  Add details about the new grant.
    
    Most fields are optional and you can enter as little or as much information as you want. The following table describes the type of information that you can enter on each FastTab.
