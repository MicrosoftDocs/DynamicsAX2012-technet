# Prerequisite skills and knowledge 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Microsoft Dynamics AX is built on several other Microsoft products and technologies. To implement the Microsoft Dynamics AX program in a manner that takes full advantage of this technology platform, you must have advanced information technology skills and knowledge.

## Prerequisites for system administrators

We recommend that system administrators who are preparing to deploy Microsoft Dynamics AX be familiar with general industry practices that pertain to the reliability, scalability, availability, performance optimization, security, and monitoring of a network infrastructure and applications. The base components of Microsoft Dynamics AX include Application Object Server (AOS), the database server, the model store, which was previously known as the application file server, and the Microsoft Dynamics AX client. To install the base components, you must understand the following Microsoft technologies:

  - The Windows Server operating system that is used to deploy the Microsoft Dynamics AX server components

  - The Windows client operating system that is used to deploy the Microsoft Dynamics AX Windows client

  - The Microsoft .NET Framework

  - Windows Server Terminal Services, if this technology is required

  - Advanced network management in an environment that uses Active Directory Domain Services.

The following table describes the skills and knowledge that are required to deploy specific components of a Microsoft Dynamics AX implementation.
