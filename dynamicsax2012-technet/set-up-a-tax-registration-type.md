# Set up a tax registration type 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Many countries and regions have different regulations and requirements for recording tax registration numbers. Use this procedure to manage tax registration numbers for these parties: customers, vendors, and legal entities.

Before you can set up tax registration numbers, you must set up tax registration types for the different types of taxes that each party is subject to.

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **Sales tax** \> **External** \> **Tax registration types**. Click **New**.

2.  In the **Enter tax registration type details** form, type a name and description.

3.  In the **Country/region** field, select a country or region.

4.  In the **Restricted to** field, if the registration type applies only to a person or an organization, select **Person** or **Organization**. Otherwise, select **None**.

5.  Select the **Unique** check box if the registration number for the registration type must be unique.

6.  Select the **Can be updated** check box if the registration number for the registration type can be updated after it has been specified.

7.  Click **Create**.

8.  On the **Applicable countries/regions, uses, and validation rules** FastTab, click **Add**.

9.  In the **Country/region** field, select a country/region.

10. In the **Tax authority** field, select a tax authority.

11. In the **Format** field, specify a format for the tax registration number.

12. To add additional countries/regions, tax authorities, or validation rules to the tax registration type, click **Add**.
