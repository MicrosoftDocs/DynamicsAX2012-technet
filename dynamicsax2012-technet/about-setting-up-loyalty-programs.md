# About setting up loyalty programs 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

A loyalty program helps you ensure customer loyalty by rewarding customers for buying products in your retail stores. In retail stores, a plastic or paper card typically identifies the cardholder as a member of a loyalty program. This card may be referred to as a loyalty card, rewards card, points card, advantage card, or club card.

Customers can use the card as a form of identification when they deal with the retailer. By presenting a loyalty card, a customer typically receives either a discount on the current purchase or an allotment of points that can be used for future purchases. When a customer asks for a loyalty card, the card issuer collects identifying or demographic data, such as a name and address.

You can set up your loyalty program so that customers earn points based on specific criteria. The points can be calculated in various ways. To earn loyalty points, the customer swipes a loyalty card at the register. Based on the card number and the products that the customer buys, the program calculates how many points are earned.

## New or changed for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, you can set up loyalty programs so that customers earn loyalty points when they purchase products through your online store.

To apply loyalty programs to your online stores, set up and configure the loyalty program by using the same steps that you use for your brick and mortar stores. After the loyalty program is configured for the online store, customers can link their loyalty card number to their online account to earn loyalty points when they shop online.
