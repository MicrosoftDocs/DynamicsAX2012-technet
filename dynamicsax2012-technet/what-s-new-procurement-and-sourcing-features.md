<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Evaluate vendors based on their ability to provide products and services.</p></td>
<td><p>You can rate vendors based on criteria that you define for each category of item or service that the vendors provide. You can evaluate a vendor for each transaction that you have with the vendor.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="set-up-vendor-evaluation-criteria.md">Set up vendor evaluation criteria</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Support for multiple languages for procurement catalogs.</p></td>
<td><p>You can create one procurement catalog that can be viewed in multiple languages, based on the setting for the user profile language and locale in Microsoft Dynamics AX. Purchasing managers can define the translated text that appears on the procurement site.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="procurement-catalogs-overview.md">Procurement catalogs overview</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Rate and provide feedback about products and vendors on the procurement site.</p></td>
<td><p>Workers can rate products that they have ordered and vendors with whom they have done business, and can provide feedback about their experiences. The feedback is compiled and displayed on the procurement site, so that all users can make informed decisions when they order products or do business with a particular vendor. Purchasing managers can control whether ratings and comments are allowed on the procurement site, and whether all comments must be reviewed before they appear on the procurement site.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="rate-products-and-vendors.md">Rate products and vendors</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>New <strong>Employee service</strong> page.</p></td>
<td><p>The Employee services site in Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX has been updated to improve usability. You can now view all available tasks in one place. Related tasks are grouped under a task heading, and when you click the heading for a task group, a new activity site or list page opens, where you can quickly and easily complete tasks.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="using-the-employee-services-site.md">Using the Employee Services site</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Import commodity codes and minimum or maximum order quantities into vendor catalogs.</p></td>
<td><p>Vendors can generate catalogs that include standard commodity codes, and those codes can be automatically mapped to procurement categories in Microsoft Dynamics AX. Vendors must comply with the Microsoft Dynamics AX customer’s unit of measure for quantities. Vendors can specify minimum, maximum, and standard order quantities for products in the vendor catalog. Vendors can also specify the lead time, which is the number of days that a vendor requires between the order date and the shipment date.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh242810(v=ax.60)">Import categories (form)</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Enhancements to the catalog import schema.</p></td>
<td><p>The catalog import schema has been updated so that vendors can more easily modify an existing catalog or overwrite an existing catalog with a new catalog. When a vendor uploads a new catalog to replace an existing catalog, the matching items and services are replaced with the new data. Any new items and services that are not in the existing catalog are added, and any items and services in the existing catalog that do not match the items and services in the new catalog are deleted. When the vendor modifies selected items in an existing catalog, only the modifications that are included in the catalog schema are applied to the existing catalog products. Any new items and services that are not in the existing catalog, but that are included in the modified catalog file, are added.</p>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Consolidate the navigation categories on the procurement site.</p></td>
<td><p>When you set up a catalog, you define the catalog navigation hierarchy that appears on the procurement site. The catalog navigation hierarchy can contain multiple levels of detail for each procurement category. You can define the level of detail for the catalog navigation categories that you display on your procurement site. By consolidating the category levels, you can limit the levels of detail that workers have to sort through to find the product that they want to order.</p>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Enhancements to the navigation and usability of the procurement site.</p></td>
<td><p>The following changes have been made to improve usability on the Order products site:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Navigation is simplified, so that you can search for products by category, item, vendor, and vendor catalog. The filters have been moved to the top of the webpage.</p></li>
<li><p>Visibility into the status of orders that have been entered is improved. A single list displays all orders that were entered and the status of each order, from the creation and approval of the purchase requisition to the generation and fulfillment of a purchase order. You can also view the details for a selected order.</p></li>
<li><p>You can now add selected products to the shopping cart directly from the product list page. The product details page is displayed only if order details for the product must be entered.</p></li>
<li><p>You can now configure the data that is displayed for each procurement category. For example, if you only order office supplies directly from a vendor, you can configure the category to display only links to vendor catalogs.</p></li>
<li><p>The visibility for ordering from a vendor is improved.</p></li>
<li><p>The usability of the shopping cart is improved. For example, you can now select all items in the cart for checkout.</p></li>
<li><p>Fewer steps are required when you use the Checkout Wizard to create a purchase requisition.</p></li>
<li><p>Additional details about existing purchase requisitions are added, so that it is easier to add items from a shopping cart to an existing purchase requisition during checkout.</p></li>
<li><p>Purchase requisitions are accessible from the Employee services site.</p></li>
</ul>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Enhancements to Role Centers for purchasing professionals in Enterprise Portal.</p></td>
<td><p>New Web Part reports can be added to the Role Centers for the purchasing agent and purchasing manager. The Web Part data includes metrics and reporting that provide visibility into vendor and procurement spending. The Web Part data also includes additional cues for purchasing professionals, and an expanded work list that shows alerts or workflow notifications. You can click a report to view the details for the reported data.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Policy framework.</p></td>
<td><p>You can create rules and apply them to different parts of the enterprise. These rules help the organization enforce standard internal business controls for processes such as requisitions, submission of corporate expenses, and enforcement of corporate audits. For more information about the policy framework, see the white paper <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=213137%26clcid=0x409">Using the Policy Framework in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012</a>.</p></td>

<tr class="even">
<td><p>Manage internal catalogs.</p></td>
<td><p>You can set up and maintain catalogs for ordering the items or services that employees require to perform their daily activities. You can set up the catalog’s navigation structure, import catalog data from vendors, associate products with catalog categories, and design the welcome message that is displayed on the procurement site for the catalog. After a catalog is set up, you can publish the catalog to make it available to your employees.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="procurement-catalogs-overview.md">Procurement catalogs overview</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Add items and services to a shopping cart.</p></td>
<td><p>When you select items or services from a procurement catalog or a vendor catalog, you can add those items to a shopping cart. You can view the items in your shopping cart at any time, delete items that you no longer want, modify any configurable product attributes, or modify the quantity of the items that you want to purchase. When you are ready to check out, you can create a purchase requisition directly from the shopping cart and submit it for processing. You can then return to the procurement order site to continue searching for items or services, or you can exit the procurement order site when you have finished.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="add-items-to-the-shopping-cart.md">Add items to the shopping cart</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Manage catalogs that are hosted externally.</p></td>
<td><p>Catalog managers can now set up a direct link to an external vendor catalog that is hosted on the vendor’s website. The vendor manages the product data and metadata. Users are directed to the vendor’s website to select products, and then, based on the configurations that are defined by the purchasing manager or purchasing agent, users can either check out directly from the vendor’s website or return to the Microsoft Dynamics AX procurement order site to check out.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="external-vendor-catalogs-overview.md">External vendor catalogs overview</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">

<p>A new, dedicated process is introduced for corrections to purchase receipts. You can now correct, or partially or fully reverse, a specific product receipt that has been posted.

Microsoft Dynamics AX also supports separate roles for creating or maintaining trade agreements, and for approving, bulk updating, and controlling date types in trade agreements.</p>
<p>In earlier versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX, changes to an order or an order line could indirectly cause the trade agreements to be reevaluated. This reevaluation could overwrite values that had been entered manually or entered by an external source. External sources include sales quotations, project quotations, purchase requisitions, RFQs, purchase agreements or sales agreements, projects, Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Integration Framework (AIF), or Enterprise Portal. Now, configuration settings can prevent unintended reevaluation of trade agreements.</p>
<p>The smart rounding concept has also been introduced. Smart rounding is a type of psychological pricing or price ending that is based on the marketing theory that prices have a psychological impact on people. Smart rounding pertains to unusual prices that are somewhat less than a round number, such as USD 19.99. Smart rounding can be applied after a bulk adjustment of trade agreements, or it can be applied automatically after a unit price has been calculated, based on a generic currency and an exchange rate. Date type control enables trade agreements to be evaluated, based not only on the entry dates but also on the requested dates.</p>

<p>When a change is requested, the purchase order is set to a draft state until it is approved. Only an approved purchase order can be confirmed. Even if change management is not enabled, confirmation of purchase orders is mandatory. Therefore, orders cannot be received and invoiced until the purchase order has been confirmed.</p>
