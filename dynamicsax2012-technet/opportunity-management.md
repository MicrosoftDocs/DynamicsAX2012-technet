# Opportunity management 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You use lead management to create lead records. Lead records help your sales and marketing teams gather and store information about a lead. In opportunity management, leads are qualified and become opportunities. Like lead management, opportunity management is used to track and store information.

When a lead record becomes an opportunity record, you can start to track more sales-related information, such as quotations and competitors. By tracking the competition for a sale, you can obtain valuable information about how to win the opportunity and gain another customer.

When you manage your opportunities, you can also assign probability percentages and prognosis ratings to the opportunity. You can then track the probability percentage, which is the chance that the opportunity will become a customer.

As soon as you provide quotations and the contact at the opportunity makes a decision, you can track whether you won the opportunity and why you won it. If you lose the opportunity, you can track why you lost it and to whom you lost it. This information can be useful later.
