# Set up Budgeting workflows 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Some organizations require that Budgeting documents, such as budget register entries and general budget reservations, be approved by a user other than the person who entered them. To set up an approval process, you can create a Budgeting workflow. You can also set up other processes to update budget balances without user intervention or to have a user review the information in a Budgeting document.

This topic has been updated to include information about features that were added or changed in the following hotfix for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 Cumulative Update 8: KB3047235

A workflow represents a business process. It defines how a document flows through the system and indicates who must complete a task or approve a document. There are several benefits of using the workflow system in your organization:

  - **Consistent processes** — You can define the approval process for specific documents, such as purchase requisitions and expense reports. Using the workflow system helps to ensure that documents are processed and approved in a consistent and efficient manner.

  - **Process visibility** — You can track the status, history, and performance metrics of a specific workflow instance. This helps you determine whether changes should be made to the workflow to improve efficiency.

  - **Centralized work list** — Users can view a centralized work list to view the workflow tasks and approvals assigned to them. This work list is available from the Role Center pages in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client and Enterprise Portal.

## Budgeting workflows

Use this information to set up and enable workflow configurations for Budgeting documents. Based on the document type, you can require manual approval, workflow approval, or no approval.

If you set up a workflow for budget account entries, the workflow must be contained in another workflow for budget register entries. If all the budget account entries in a budget register entry can be approved as group, you can use a **Budget register entry workflow**. If the budget account entry lines require different workflow approvals, you must use a **Budget account entry workflow** to create different workflow configurations. For example, you might use one **Budget account entry workflow** configuration to review and approve a high amount, and another **Budget account entry workflow** configuration to review and approve a low amount.

You can associate budget register entry workflows with any of the budget codes that have been set up to identify the budget types. After you assign a workflow to a budget code, all budget register entries that use that budget code require workflow approval before you can update budget balances. For more information, see [Define budget codes](define-budget-codes.md).

After you create a workflow configuration for a Budgeting document, additional controls are displayed at the top of the form when the document is saved. These controls include a yellow information bar and a **Submit** button or an **Actions** menu. For more information, see [Submit a document](submit-a-document.md) and [Workflow actions](workflow-actions.md).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Some buttons in the <STRONG>Budget register entry</STRONG> form are not available after a budget register entry has been submitted for workflow approval. When the budget register entry or budget account entry is approved, the options in the <STRONG>Update</STRONG> and <STRONG>Transfer</STRONG> menus are available. Other controls and fields in the form might not be available. If you modify a budget register entry that has been approved, the budget register entry must be resubmitted to workflow. You cannot modify a budget register entry after you update budget balances.</P>



For an overview of workflow in Microsoft Dynamics AX, see [Overview of the workflow system](overview-of-the-workflow-system.md) and [Workflow concepts](workflow-concepts.md).

You can use workflow approvals for the following Budgeting document types.

## New or changed for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, and the General Budget Reservation hotfix KB3047235

You must set up Budgeting workflows for budget plans before you set up a budget planning process. The budget plan workflow configuration that you set up is used to submit budget plans, and their worksheets and justifications, for review and approval in each stage of a budget planning process. The budget planning process defines the order of the budget planning stages and associates the process with a budget organization hierarchy. When you configure the workflow, you can assign users to a workflow task based on the budget organization, security role, or user group.

When you configure a budget planning process, you associate a Budgeting workflow ID with each budget planning workflow. After the budget plan is submitted to the workflow, and a user finishes an assignment, the budget plan moves to the next budget planning stage by using the stage transition element in the Budgeting workflow configuration.

## The types of workflows you can create

The following table lists the types of workflows that you can create in Budgeting.

<td><p>Create review and approval workflows for budget plans. Budget plan workflows must contain a stage transition element for each transition that moves a budget plan to the next budget planning stage. For example, a workflow for a budget planning process that has three stages requires two stage transition elements to connect the three approval elements that are associated with the three budget planning stages.

## Create a workflow

To create a workflow, follow these steps.

1.  Click **Budgeting** \> **Setup** \> **Budgeting workflows**.

2.  On the **Action Pane**, click **New**.

3.  Select the type of workflow to create.

4.  Click **Create workflow**. The workflow editor is displayed. Design the workflow by dragging workflow elements onto the canvas.

5.  Configure each element of the workflow. For more information, see [Configure workflow elements](configure-workflow-elements.md).

6.  Repeat steps 2 through 5 to create additional workflows for Budgeting.

## Calculated fields and expressions

The following calculated fields and expressions are used with Budgeting workflow approvals. For each workflow, you can set up conditions that include the calculated fields and expressions.

<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
