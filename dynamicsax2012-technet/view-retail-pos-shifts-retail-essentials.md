# View Retail POS shifts (Retail essentials) [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to use the **Shifts** form to look up closed shifts from stores. Shifts have unique numbers and are associated with specific registers. If some shifts did not post during statement posting, this form can help you determine the reason. You can also use this form to look up previous Z reports.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The information on the <STRONG>Details</STRONG> tab in the form includes the information that is on X reports.</P>




> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Retail essentials, the form that you use to complete this task includes a subset of the controls that are available for other configurations of Retail. If a topic about this form describes controls that you don't see, it may be because you’re using Retail essentials.</P>
