# Attach inventory items to service objects 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This topic explains how to attach an inventory item to a service object. When you attach an item to a service object, you can control and report the service activities that are performed for the item.

Before you can attach items to service objects, you must create the items in the **Released product details** form. For more information, see [Create items](create-items.md).

Use the following steps to attach an inventory item to a service object:

1.  Click **Service management** \> **Setup** \> **Service objects** \> **Service objects**.

2.  In the **Item number** field, select the item to attach to the service object.

3.  Save the service object.

The item is now attached to the service object, and any inventory dimensions specified for the item are also copied to the service object.
