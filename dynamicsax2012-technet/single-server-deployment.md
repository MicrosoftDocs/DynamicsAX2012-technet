# Single-server deployment 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A single-server deployment occurs when you deploy all the Microsoft Dynamics AX components on a single computer. We recommend that you consider a single-server deployment only for development or demonstration environments.

You must make sure that the single-server deployment fits in with your overall strategy for IT infrastructure and development. Carefully consider the hardware and software that are required for the single-server deployment to guarantee appropriate response times for your developers. For the current hardware and software requirements for Microsoft Dynamics AX, download Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 System Requirements from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=195222).
