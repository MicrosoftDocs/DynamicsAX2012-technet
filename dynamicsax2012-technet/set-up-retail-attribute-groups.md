# Set up retail attribute groups 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use attributes and attribute groups to add descriptive characteristics to your retail products, such as size, weight, capacity, and special features. After you define attributes, you can group them together into attribute groups. You can include an attribute in one or more attribute groups.

You can assign attribute groups to retail channels or retail categories. If you assign attribute groups to a retail channel or retail categories, any products that are assigned to the retail channel or retail categories can inherit the attributes that are included in the attribute group.

You must define attributes before you can add them to an attribute group. For information about how to set up attributes, see [Set up attributes and attribute types](set-up-attributes-and-attribute-types.md).

1.  Click **Product information management** \> **Setup** \> **Attributes** \> **Attribute groups**.

2.  In the **Attribute groups** form, click **New** to add a new attribute group.

3.  On the **General** FastTab, enter the name, friendly name, description, and any help text for the attribute group.

4.  Click the **Attributes** FastTab.

5.  Click **Add** to add attributes to the attribute group. In the **Default value** field, you can enter a default value for the selected attributes.

6.  If you add HTML, image, or video attributes, click **Edit** to open a form where you can view or add HTML text, image files, or video files to the attribute.

7.  Click **Translate** to open the **Text translation** form, where you can enter the description, friendly name, and help text for the attribute group in additional languages.
