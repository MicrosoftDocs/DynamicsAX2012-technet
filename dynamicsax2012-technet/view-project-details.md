# View project details 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use the **View project** page to view information about the projects that are created for your legal entity. Projects involve various stages that make up a particular project cycle. A project can be assigned any project stage that has been defined in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client.

You can also use the **All projects** page to view a number of other documents and records that are associated with a project, including sales orders, purchase orders, purchase requisitions, project transactions, service agreements, service orders, service subscriptions, and cases.

When you view project information, the **Project stage** field lists the current status of the project:

  - **Created** – The project has been created.

  - **Estimated** – Estimation for the project is completed.

  - **Scheduled** – Hour consumption is scheduled for the project.

  - **In process** – Work on the project has started. You can enter transactions for a project only when the project is in this stage.

  - **Finished** – The project is completed.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The estimation and scheduling processes can be performed only in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client. In addition, except for timesheets and expense reports, project transactions are entered in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client.</P>
