On July 1, April pays vendors. She uses a payment proposal to help her complete this task more efficiently.

April clicks **Accounts payable** \> **Journals** \> **Payments** \> **Payment journal**. She then clicks **Payment proposal** \> **Create payment proposal**.

April uses the **Vendor payment proposal** form to define the set of invoices that will be included in the proposal.

## Option 1: By cash discount

April selects **By cash discount** as the proposal type in the **Vendor payment proposal** form. For the range of payment dates, she uses June 26 to July 10. The following invoices are included in the proposal:

  - 1001, because the discount date of June 29 is in the range of payment dates

  - 1002, because the discount date of July 4 is in the range of payment dates

  - 1004, because the discount date of July 1 is in the range of payment dates

The following invoice is not included in the proposal:

  - 1003, because the invoice does not have a discount date

## Option 2: Per due date

April selects **Per due date** as the proposal type. For the range of payment dates, she uses June 26 to July 10. The following invoice is included in the proposal:

  - 1003, because the due date of June 29 is in the range of payment dates

The following invoices are not included in the proposal:

  - 1001, because the due date of July 15 is outside the range of payment dates

  - 1002, because the due date of July 20 is outside the range of payment dates

  - 1004, because the due date of July 17 is outside the range of payment dates

## Option 3: Due date and cash discount

April selects **Due date and cash discount** as the proposal type. For the range of payment dates, she uses June 26 to July 10. The following invoices are included in the proposal:

  - 1003, because the due date of June 29 is in the range of payment dates

  - 1001, because the discount date of June 29 is in the range of payment dates

  - 1002, because the discount date of July 4 is in the range of payment dates

  - 1004, because the discount date of July 1 is in the range of payment dates
