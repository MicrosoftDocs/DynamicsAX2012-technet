# What's new: Country-specific features for Japan (JPN) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, we changed and added country-specific functionality for Japan. This topic is divided into two sections. The first section outlines the key features that have a broad impact on Japanese installations, such as features that affect consolidated invoices, cash flow statements, bills of exchange, financial dimensions, and the global address book (GAB). The second section describes additional changes to country-specific functionality for Japan. For more information about specific features for Japan, see [TechNet Library for Application Users - Japan](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=299914).

## New functionality

AX 2012 R2 and AX 2012 R3 includes new functionality for consolidating invoices, generating cash flow statements, generating bills of exchange, and creating financial dimensions.

## Comparison with Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009

These features have changed considerably since AX 2009. AX 2012 R2 and AX 2012 R3 includes changes to the following areas:

  - Consolidated invoices

  - Cash flow statements

  - Bills of exchange

  - Financial dimensions

  - Global address book

<td><p>Monthly consolidated invoices</p></td>
<td><p>According to the Accounting Standards Board of Japan (ASBJ), consolidating monthly invoices for payment is a common business practice in Japan. You can combine multiple posted invoices from purchase orders or sales orders, purchase journals or customer journals, and purchase return orders or sales return orders. After you create consolidated invoices for vendors or customers, you can pay the vendors or receive payment from the customers every month.</p>
<p>You can calculate the due date for a vendor or customer payment, based on the cutoff day.</p>
<p>The following changes have been made to the consolidation process:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>Unconfirmed</strong>, <strong>Confirmed</strong>, <strong>Settled</strong>, and <strong>Partially settled</strong> statuses have been added for consolidated customer invoices. Additionally, you can reopen a consolidated customer invoice.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Partially settled</strong> status has been added for consolidated vendor invoices, so that you can partially settle consolidated vendor invoices.</p></li>
<li><p>AR and AP invoices can be consolidated based on the <strong>Execution date</strong> field instead of the consolidation date.</p></li>
<li><p>You can select an invoice for consolidation by using the consolidation date that is defined in the <strong>Customers</strong> form.</p></li>
<li><p>You can select an order to invoice based on the consolidation date in the sales update.</p></li>
<li><p>You can create consolidated invoices for payment proposals.</p></li>
<li><p>The summary calculation for consolidated customer invoices has been updated.</p></li>

<li><p>The cash changes at the beginning and end of the financial period.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also plan the cash flow statements for the next financial period. The detailed cash flow information contains economic activities such as sales order transactions, production manufacturing, fixed assets investments, and common stock cash dividends. The economic activities are then posted in the related ledger accounts. This cash flow statement generates the required information from the dimensions table, the ledger table, ledger transactions, and the cash flow that is calculated from the amount of the transactions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The cash flow statement is generated in an Excel worksheet.</p>

<li><p><strong>Reserve method</strong> – The amount of the government subsidy is maintained as a separate value on the equity side of the balance sheet. The amount of the government subsidy does not affect the net book value of the fixed asset.</p></li>

<li><p>When you run a depreciation proposal, Microsoft Dynamics AX automatically calculates and posts the allocation of reduction entry together with the depreciation process.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up and run a batch process to periodically update the reduction entry documents. In the setup of the batch process, you specify criteria such as fixed asset groups and periods.</p></li>
<li><p>If you must perform this task to claim a government grant, generate a reduction entry proposal for fixed assets by attaching the reduction entry document to the proposal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you calculate depreciation for a fixed asset that you acquire by using the subsidy, Microsoft Dynamics AX adjusts the calculations for depreciation and threshold, depending on the subsidy for the fixed asset.</p>
<p>You can generate the <strong>Reduction entry transaction summary</strong> report. This report contains details about the reduction entry transactions, based on criteria that you specify, such as the fiscal year, reduction entry method, and book type.</p>

<td><p>Assemble or disassemble fixed assets by using on-hand inventory items.</p></td>
<td><p>You can set up AX 2012 R3 to enable the assembly or disassembly of a fixed asset by using on-hand inventory items. You can perform the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Assemble a fixed asset by using on-hand inventory items</strong> – You can reserve the list of assembly components for a fixed asset. You can then create and post an acquisition journal or an acquisition adjustment journal for the fixed asset by deducting the on-hand inventory items. The difference between the acquisition cost and the inventory cost is posted to the acquisition offset account that you specify in the fixed assets posting profile.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disassemble inventory items during fixed asset maintenance or after fixed asset disposal</strong> – You can reserve the list of disassembled components that can be included in inventory and reused after the fixed asset is maintained or disposed of. You can then create and post a write-down regulation journal or a disposal scrap journal to disassemble the fixed asset and include the components in inventory for reuse.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Set up a fixed asset as a deferred fixed asset, and then set up one of the following depreciation techniques for the fixed asset:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Equally divided</strong> – The depreciation amount is equally divided among all the fiscal periods in the useful life of the fixed asset.</p></li>

</ul>
<p>You can then set up the <strong>Equally divided</strong> depreciation method in the <strong>Depreciation profiles</strong> form to depreciate the deferred, low-value, or lump-sum fixed assets over one or more fiscal periods.</p>
