# Create a party record 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can create party records in two ways. When you are creating a record, such as a customer, worker, or competitor record, the information that you enter is automatically saved into a new record in the global address book.

However, if you do not know the type of record that you want to create, or if the person or organization will represent more than one entity in your organization, you can create a new party record in the **Global address book** form.

## Create a party record in the Global address book form

Before you create a party record for a person or an organization, you should verify that a party record does not already exist. Click **Home** \> **Common** \> **Global address book**. On the **Action Pane**, in the **Maintain** group, click **Check for duplicates**.

1.  Click **Home** \> **Common** \> **Global address book**. On the **Global address book** list page, on the **Action Pane**, in the **New** group, click **Party**.

2.  In the **Party** form, select whether the record is for a person or for an organization, and enter the name. The name that you enter is automatically entered in the search name field. You can modify the search name.

3.  On the **General** FastTab, enter general information about the party record.

4.  On the **Addresses** and **Contact information** FastTabs, enter address and contact information for the party record.

5.  On the **Relationships** FastTab, set up any relationships to other parties that are listed in the **Global address book** form.
