# About output orders 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This topic applies to features in the **Inventory management** module. It does not apply to features in the [Warehouse management](warehouse-management.md) module.

If a credit note is created for a sales order or a purchase order, you can use either a picking list or an output order to instruct the warehouse to pick the items and ship them to the customer.

An output order is an advanced picking function that is the basis of a shipment. From the shipment, you can start a pallet transport, a picking route, or both.

The corresponding function for a purchase order is the item arrival journal.
