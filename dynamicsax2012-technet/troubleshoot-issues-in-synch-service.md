# Troubleshoot issues in Synch Service 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

When a communication issue occurs, an error is returned by Commerce Data Exchange: Synch Service. You can view Synch Service messages in the following locations.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Synch Service is required for Retail only in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 and Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack. In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, this component is used only to support previous versions of Retail POS while you upgrade (N-1).</P>

## Troubleshoot error codes in Synch Service

Use the information in the following table to troubleshoot common errors in Synch Service. Errors in Synch Service are typically caused by one of two general issues: an error in communication between Microsoft Dynamics AX and Synch Service, or an error in the processing of a job.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The same error code can represent multiple issues. When you troubleshoot, you should consider both the documentation about the error code and the detailed error message that is displayed together with the error code.</P>

## Troubleshoot common issues with data packages

Use the information in the following table to troubleshoot issues with data packages. To view the information that is contained in a data package, you must use Commerce Data Exchange: Synch Service Pack Viewer. For more information, see [Synch Service Pack Viewer](synch-service-pack-viewer.md).

<td><p>A package that failed blocks the processing of other packages.</p></td>
<td><p>When a package is not processed successfully, its blocked status can prevent other packages from being sent, even after you have resolved the cause of the error. To resume ordinary communications, in the message database, set CancelledByUser=1 for the messages that are related to the blocked package.</p>
<p>If Synch Service was configured to upload status messages to Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can view and cancel error messages in the <strong>Commerce Data Exchange: Synch Service messages</strong> form. (Click <strong>Retail</strong> &gt; <strong>Inquiries</strong> &gt; <strong>Commerce Data Exchange: Synch Service messages</strong>.)</p>
<p>If Synch Service was not configured to upload status messages, you must use Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to cancel the blocking messages. On the originating computer, in SQL Server Management Studio, expand the <strong>Databases</strong> folder, click the message database, and then click <strong>New Query</strong>. In the query pane, type <strong>update dbo.IncomingMessages set CancelledByUser=1 where PackageNo='nnnn'</strong>, where nnnn is the ID number of the failed package.

<li><p>Confirm that the message database for the head office instance of Synch Service contains a corresponding record in the incoming messages table.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm that the request packet was created by Synch Service. A request packet is also referred to as an “I” file, and the file name is in the form &lt;Synch Service service name&gt;-&lt;sequential number&gt;-I.tmp. If the <strong>Keep Package Files</strong> check box was selected in Synch Service Settings, this file is in the working directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that .NET Business Connector is installed. .NET Business Connector is required on the communications server at the head office.</p></li>
<li><p>Verify that the entry in the incoming message table for this packet has no errors. If Synch Service cannot process a request, it does not generate a result packet, and an error occurs. A result packet is also referred to as an “R” file, and the file name is in the form &lt;Synch Service service name&gt;-&lt;sequential number&gt;-R.tmp]. This issue could be caused by a scheduler job that is not configured correctly. In this case, see the detailed message in the error log for more information.</p></li>
