# Set up replenishment service categories (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to set up service categories to use for replenishment rules for cross-docking. Cross-docking is a method of distributing inventory to stores by using transfer orders that are generated from planned purchase orders. Replenishment service categories support automatic and manual cross-docking. You can set them up to provide information about the availability of product that you sell in your stores and the delivery time for replenished inventory.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can link the service category to a vendor on the <STRONG>Retail</STRONG> FastTab in the <STRONG>Vendors</STRONG> form.</P>



To set up service categories for inventory replenishment rules, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Retail essentials** \> **Inventory management** \> **Setup** \> **Replenishment** \> **Service categories**.

2.  In the **Service categories** form, select a service category, or click **New** to create a new service category.

3.  In the **Service category** field, type an ID number. Then, in the **Description** field, type a description.

4.  Enter additional information about delivery dates, replenishment rules, and cross-docking warehouses. For more information, see [Service categories (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh597287\(v=ax.60\)).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Retail essentials, the form that you use to complete this task includes a subset of the controls that are available for other configurations of Retail. If a topic about this form describes controls that you don't see, it may be because you’re using Retail essentials.</P>
