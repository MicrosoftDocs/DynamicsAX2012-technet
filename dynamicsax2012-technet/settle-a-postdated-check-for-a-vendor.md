# Settle a postdated check for a vendor 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use the **Vendor postdated checks** form to settle postdated checks received from the vendor. You can settle a postdated check issued to a vendor when the bank has cleared the check transaction. This financial transaction also clears the bridge account transaction for the postdated check. You must select the **Post journal entries for postdated checks** check box in the **Cash and bank management parameters** form to settle a postdated check.

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Common** \> **Postdated checks** \> **Vendor postdated checks**.

2.  Click **Checks to send to bank** to list the postdated checks that have reached their maturity dates.

3.  Select a check that has been cleared by the bank, and then click **Settle clearing entries** to settle the vendor account for the check transaction.

4.  Close the form to save your changes.
