# About electronic payments to public sector vendors (Public sector)

This topic explains how you can distribute the payment of an invoice to multiple vendor bank accounts. On the Accounts payable **Vendor invoice** form, you can select multiple bank accounts and allocate a percentage to each bank account. Based on the vendor bank accounts that you select, single or multiple open transactions are created against the invoice. You can create payments for each journal line without creating a partial payment for each vendor bank account.

For example, if there’s an existing purchase order for $100 and Bank A is the default vendor bank account, then Bank A appears in the payment disbursement table with 100% allocation. (If there is no default vendor bank account, the table is blank.) You can change the allocation for Bank A to 30% and add a new row. On the new row, you can select another vendor bank such as Bank B and the allocation for the new row is automatically updated to 70%.
