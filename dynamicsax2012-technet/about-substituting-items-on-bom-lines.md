# About substituting items on BOM lines 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

If you want to substitute an item on a BOM line, you can specify validity dates on the BOM line to define a period of time for the substitution.

## Example

For example, you might substitute a frosted lampshade for the standard white lampshade in the lamp BOM for the month of May. Or, if the sub-production that is required for a BOM version is not available, you might use a replacement component from the vendor, instead.
