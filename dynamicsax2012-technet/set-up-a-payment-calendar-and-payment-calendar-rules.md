## Configure payment calendar rules

After you set up payment calendars, you can set up rules that determine the payment calendar that will be used to calculate due dates for customer and vendor payments, or to calculate grace periods. For more information about these rules, see [About payment calendars](about-payment-calendars.md).

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Setup** \> **Payment** \> **Payment calendar configuration - vendors**.
    
    –or–
    
    Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Payment** \> **Payment calendar configuration – customers**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  In the **Rule name** field that is displayed, enter an identifier for the rule.

4.  In the **Rule type** field, select one of the following types:
    
      - **Specific** – Create a payment calendar rule for a specific combination of the method of payment and terms of payment. When you select this type of rule, the **Method of payment** and **Terms of payment** fields are displayed. You can use all combinations or a specific combination of the method of payment and terms of payment for the rule.
    
      - **Customer/vendor location** – Create a payment calendar rule for a specific country or region. When you select this type of rule, the **Customer - location** or **Vendor location** field group is displayed. Location information will be retrieved from the documents in the order in which you arrange the documents in the list that is displayed. You can click **Move up** and **Move down** to arrange the documents.
    
      - **Company location** – Create a payment calendar rule for the primary address that is specified for the legal entity.

5.  Click **Create rule**.

6.  In the **Define rules** area, select **Active** to use the rule for the selected payment calendars. The rule becomes active when you close the form.

7.  In the **Prioritize rules** area, select the rule, and then click **Move up** or **Move down** to move the rule up or down in the list.

8.  If you are setting up a payment calendar rule for a country or region, in the **Select calendars** area, select the check box for each calendar that you want the rule to apply to.
