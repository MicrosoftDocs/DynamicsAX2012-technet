# About cost categories used in Production control and in Project management and accounting 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Certain types of production work can apply to project time estimates and reporting, which requires a cost category for production and project purposes. Additional project-related information must be defined when a cost category is used in production and projects. For example, the hourly costs that are associated with projects can be different from the hourly costs that are associated with production. A cost category that is used in **Production** and **Project** can be defined in the **Cost categories** form.

> <P>Cost accounting contains a <STRONG>Project categories</STRONG> form, but it has no relationship to the functionality that is described in this topic.</P>



When you select to use a cost category in projects, the **Cost categories** form displays additional project-related information. Additional tabs include project-related information, such as the assignment of a category group, a line property, and ledger accounts. The cost category must be assigned to a category group that supports a transaction type of hours. A line property indicates the default about how reported time is chargeable to a project. The ledger accounts that are related to costs and sales typically are defined for the category group that is assigned to the cost category. However, specific accounts can be defined for an individual cost category.

Additional buttons provide access to project-related information about a selected cost category. For example, you can view project-related transactions, define employees or projects, define hourly costs and sales prices, and view reports.
