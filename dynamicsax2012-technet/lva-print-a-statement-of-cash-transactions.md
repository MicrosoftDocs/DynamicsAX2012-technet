At the end of each month, all companies operating in Latvia are required to declare all cash transactions that exceed a stated regulatory limit. You can create a legally compliant report listing all account holders whose total incoming and outgoing cash payments exceeded a specified limit during the reporting period. Payment transactions are retrieved from the corresponding petty cash accounts and displayed in the **Cash transaction** **reporting** form. You specify a minimum limit and include additional filter criteria, such as the transaction date, currency type, and transaction amount, to select the relevant transactions. All payment transactions that exceed the specified limit and satisfy the filter criteria are marked for printing.

Incoming and outgoing payment transactions are categorized and displayed per payment transaction code in the report.
