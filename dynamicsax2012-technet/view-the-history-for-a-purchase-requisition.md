# View the history for a purchase requisition 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can view and compare the change history for versions of a purchase requisition. When a purchase requisition is submitted for review, the purchase requisition is saved as the first version.

Version entries are also created when a purchase order is generated for the purchase requisition lines.
