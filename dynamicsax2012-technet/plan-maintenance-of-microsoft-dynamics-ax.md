# Plan maintenance of Microsoft Dynamics AX 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The Microsoft Dynamics AX system, like any other software system, requires ongoing monitoring and maintenance. Routine maintenance includes the following tasks:

  - Backing up databases

  - Monitoring alerts that are generated by infrastructure components, Microsoft Dynamics AX components, or the database

  - Monitoring your infrastructure and applications to make sure that service level agreements are met

  - Installing applicable hotfixes or updates

Before you implement a Microsoft Dynamics AX system in production, determine a maintenance strategy that meets the needs of your company. You must have a maintenance strategy for each environment that you run. This includes development, test, production, and training environments.

The topics in this section provide information about how to maintain Microsoft Dynamics AX and its components.
