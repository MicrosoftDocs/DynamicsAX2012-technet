# About credit notes 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When an amount on a customer invoice has a negative value, the invoice is classified as a credit note. When the document is printed, it has the title **Credit note**.

When you create a credit note to credit an amount that was previously invoiced, you must first select the invoiced amount for crediting. Then you create a credit note by following the same procedure that you use to create an ordinary customer invoice. That is, you must select the transactions that were previously posted on a customer invoice and then create and post a credit note proposal.

You can include transactions that are selected for crediting, credit transactions, and transactions that are posted on the same invoice or credit note. The document is then classified as either an invoice or a credit note, depending on whether the total amount is positive or negative.

## Crediting sales orders

The procedure for crediting sales orders is different than the procedure for crediting project transactions. The following table describes the differences.
