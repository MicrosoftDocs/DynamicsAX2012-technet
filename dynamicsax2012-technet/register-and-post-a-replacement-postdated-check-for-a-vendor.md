# Register and post a replacement postdated check for a vendor 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

If your original check to a vendor is lost or damaged, you can issue a replacement postdated check to the vendor. When you register the check details, provide a reference to the original check and indicate that the new check is a replacement for the original. You can also post the replacement check.

You must reverse the check transaction if the status of the original check is **Posted** or **Paid** in the **Postdated check status** field in the **Journal voucher** form:

  - **Posted** – Use the **Transaction reversal** form to reverse a posted transaction. For more information, see [Reverse a transaction](reverse-a-transaction.md).

  - **Paid** – Use the **Closed transaction editing in several currencies** form to reverse a paid transaction. For more information, see [Reverse settlements](reverse-settlements.md).
