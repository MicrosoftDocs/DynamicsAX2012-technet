# Accounts receivable 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_






Use Accounts receivable to track customer invoices and incoming payments. You can create customer invoices that are based on sales orders or packing slips. You can also enter free text invoices that are not related to sales orders. You can receive payments by using several different payment types. These include bills of exchange, cash, checks, credit cards, and electronic payments. If your organization includes multiple legal entities, you can use centralized payments to record payments in a single legal entity on behalf of the other legal entities.

Use the **Settle open transactions** form to settle invoices with payments or credit notes. You can also enter payments and settle them in the **Enter customer payments** form. To view customer information, use the **All customers** list page and related forms. You can manage overdue balances, calculate interest, and generate collection letters by using the **Collections** list page and related forms.
