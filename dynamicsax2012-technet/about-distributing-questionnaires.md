# About distributing questionnaires 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

After you design a questionnaire, you must distribute it in order to make it available to a selected person or group of people. For more information, see [Using questionnaires](using-questionnaires.md).

There are several ways that you can distribute a questionnaire:

  - By making it active – The questionnaire is available to all employees unless a questionnaire group is set up to restrict access to the questionnaire.

  - By assigning rights to a questionnaire group – The questionnaire is available to all members of a selected group.

  - By creating planned answer sessions – The questionnaire is available only to a particular person.

  - By creating a schedule – The questionnaire can be available to either multiple employees, or to multiple contact persons, applicants, or course participants.
