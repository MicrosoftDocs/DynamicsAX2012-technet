## 1\. Configure Microsoft Dynamics AX for EHF electronic invoicing

The electronic invoices that you generate include required information, such as the contact person, invoice number, and address information. Microsoft Dynamics AX applies validation rules when invoices are generated so that you can verify that the correct information is entered. If you find errors, you can correct the errors before you submit the invoices.

You must set up folders where you can save the error messages, the XML files, and the EHF files. Microsoft Dynamics AX uses these folders to store source documents, processed documents, Extensible Stylesheet Language for Transformations (XSLT) files, and the error messages that are generated when the XML file is converted to EHF format. You can specify these folders when you set up AIF and set up the batch job for EHF electronic invoicing. For more information, see 3. Set up AIF for EHF electronic invoicing and 5. Set up batch processing for EHF electronic invoicing.

To configure Microsoft Dynamics AX for EHF electronic invoicing, set up the following folder structure in a shared location that is accessible from the Application Object Server (AOS) computer and from any client computers that are used as batch servers in your system.

  - \\\\Server\\EHF\\Sales\\Error – Used to save error messages that are generated when the XML file is converted to the EHF format.

  - \\\\Server\\EHF\\Sales\\Processed files – Used to save documents after they are processed. The documents are moved from the Target folder to this folder.

  - \\\\Server\\EHF\\Sales\\Source – Used to save the XML file that is generated by Microsoft Dynamics AX.

  - \\\\Server\\EHF\\Sales\\Target – Used to save the EHF file after the XML file has been processed.

  - \\\\Server\\EHF\\Sales\\XSLT – Used to contain the XSLT schema file for collection letters.

## 2\. Set up customer accounts for EHF electronic invoicing

Use the **Customers** form to specify the address and contact details for each company that you generate electronic invoices for. You can create contacts in the **Contacts** form and assign a contact to a customer account. The contact information is included when you generate an electronic invoice for a customer. For more information, see [Customers (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa590606\(v=ax.60\)).

To set up a customer account for EHF electronic invoicing, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Customers** \> **All customers**.

2.  Double-click a customer account, or on the **Action Pane**, click **Customer** to create a customer account. For more information, see [Create a customer record](create-a-customer-record.md).

3.  In the **Customers** form, click **Edit**, and then click the **Addresses** FastTab to verify that the country or region code, ZIP or postal code, and the street name are entered for the primary address.

3.  In the **Adapter** field, select **File system adapter**. This adapter is used to create and save the EHF electronic invoices or collection letters.

4.  In the **URI** field, specify the Uniform resource identifier (URI) of the Source folder to save the sales invoices. For more information, see 1. Configure MSDAX for EHF electronic invoicing.

5.  On the **Service contract customizations** FastTab, click **Service operations**. In the **Select service operations** form, select the **CustCollectionLetterService\_NO.read** service operation for sales invoices, and move it to the **Selected service operations** list. Close the form.

6.  In the **Outbound ports** form, select the **Customize documents** check box, and then click **Data policies**.

7.  In the **Document data policies** form, click **Enable all** to select all XML schema elements, and then close the form.

8.  On the **Processing options** FastTab, in the **Default encoding format** field, select **UTF-8**.

9.  Select the **Apply value mapping** check box, and then click **Value mapping** to open the **Value mapping** form, where you can map the values such as item number, customer account number, vendor account number, terms of delivery, and unit for the outbound port. Close the form.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>In AX 2012 R3 and cumulative update 6 or later for AX 2012 R2: You must indicate the unit for which you specified the external code according to the UN/CEFACT ICG standards. For more information, see Prerequisites.</P>



10. On the **Troubleshooting** FastTab, in the **Logging mode** field, select **All document versions**.

11. Optional: Select the **Include exceptions in fault** check box to display the X++ error messages.

12. Optional: On the **Security** FastTab, in the **Restrict to company** field, select the company that the electronic invoices are generated for.
