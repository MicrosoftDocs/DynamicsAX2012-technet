# Plan for integration 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic provides guidelines that you may have to consider when you plan your data integration. Every deployment of Microsoft Dynamics AX represents a unique situation. Your specific requirements may vary.</P>



Planning is an important part of any data integration effort. When you integrate Microsoft Dynamics AX with other systems, one of the first steps is the planning phase. In this phase, the implementation team must define high-level requirements and make decisions about the design of the integration. After these requirements are defined, the partner, IT staff, and development staff can work together to define the best way to implement the exchange in Application Integration Framework (AIF).

The decisions that must be made about the design of the integration fit into two primary categories: decisions about the data and decisions about the environment.

  - **Data** – At the core of data integration is the data itself. While you plan your data integration, many decisions must be made about the data that is being exchanged and the associated business rules. This phase often involves the expertise and knowledge of business users, because these users understand the meaning of the data and can define the requirements for integration.

  - **Environment** – Configuration requirements define the environment that is used for the data exchange. Factors that affect these requirements include the network configuration, the hardware and software configuration of the external system, and the level of trust between Microsoft Dynamics AX and the external system.

Before document exchanges are configured, we recommend that the implementation team consider the questions that are described in the following table.
