# About reservation cancellations 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can cancel reservations on items and orders in, for example, the following circumstances:

  - Existing reservations must be reprioritized – You might have to cancel reservations for smaller or less important customers so that you can deliver to larger or more important customers.

  - Deliveries are unfulfilled or canceled, or items are no longer delivered – The rest of the on-hand inventory must be shared among customers who are waiting for goods.

The procedures are the same as the procedures for changing reservations.
