# About maintaining estimates 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Estimates are maintained on individual Estimate projects or on batches of Estimate projects. When Estimate projects are processed in batches by using periodic jobs, the Estimate projects that are selected for processing are grouped by period code.

You can work with estimates in the following ways:

  - To maintain estimates for individual Estimate projects, use the **Estimate** form. Depending on your version of the program, follow one of these steps:
    
      - In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2: Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Common** \> **Projects** \> **All projects**. Select a Fixed-price or Investment project that is associated with an Estimate project. On the **Action Pane**, in the **Related information** group, click **Estimates**.
    
      - Otherwise: Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Common** \> **Projects** \> **Estimate projects**. Select an Estimate project. On the **Action Pane**, in the **Related information** group, click **Estimates**.

  - To view the periodic features that are available for estimate maintenance, click **Project management and accounting** \> **Periodic** \> **Estimates**. The periodic jobs that are available correspond to the functions that are available in the **Estimate** form.

The **New**, **Calculate**, **Delete**, **Post**, **Reverse**, **Eliminate**, and **Reverse elimination** buttons in the **Estimate** form open dialog boxes that reflect the typical life cycle of an estimate. The following table contains information about the fields in these dialog boxes.

<li><p><strong>Manual</strong> – The completion percentage equals the completion percentage of the last estimate. After the estimate is created, you can change the <strong>Manual calculation</strong> field in the <strong>Estimates</strong> form.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>From cost template</strong> – A combination of the <strong>Automatic</strong> method and the <strong>Manual</strong> method. This option is set automatically or manually, depending on the default value in the cost template.</p></li>
