# (CZE) Create and correct records in the EU sales list 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Before you create a sales list, you can correct the sales list records to reflect changes that resulted from projected invoices and updated sales results. After you create the corrected records, you can transfer the data to the European Union (EU) sales list.

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Periodic** \> **Foreign trade** \> **EU sales list**. In the **Selection** filter, select **Reported**.

2.  Select a sales list record to modify, click **Copy lines**, and then select a copy option:
    
      - **To lines with status Included** – The **Corrected** check box is not automatically selected on the duplicate record.
    
      - **To adjusted lines with status Included** – The **Corrected** check box is automatically selected on the duplicate record.

3.  Select the new sales list record, update it as needed, and then click **Transfer**.

4.  In the **Transfer transactions for EU sales list** form, enter the reporting types and invoice information to define the transactions to include on the sales list report, and then click **Transfer**. For more information, see [Transfer transactions for EU sales list (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa499405\(v=ax.60\)).
