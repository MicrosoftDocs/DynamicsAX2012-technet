# Defining processes 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Each company has unique processes for marketing, leads, and sales. In **Sales and marketing**, you can define and implement these processes by creating guidelines.

You can create activities, and then integrate them into each step of the process for marketing, leads, and sales. You can require workers to complete each step of the process before they can proceed to the next step. By making certain activities required, you guarantee that all the necessary steps are taken when a process is completed.

Activities and the processes that you develop can also be attached to responsibilities. If you create responsibilities, whenever a new process is created for marketing, leads, or sales, the owner of the responsibility is automatically added to the process. The owner of the process does not have to be the same worker who created the process.
