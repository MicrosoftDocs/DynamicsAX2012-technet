<td><p>Select one or all legal entities. Only the vendors for the selected legal entities are displayed on the report.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Currency</strong></p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Start date</strong></p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Threshold</strong></p></td>
