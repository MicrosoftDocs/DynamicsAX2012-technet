# Increase or decrease the letter of guarantee value 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can increase or decrease the letter of guarantee value, as agreed on between the principal and beneficiary, after the letter of guarantee is delivered to the beneficiary.

You can increase the value of a letter of guarantee if the principal and beneficiary ask for a guarantee of a higher amount than the original request. Similarly, if the principal and beneficiary consider it mutually beneficial to lower the letter of guarantee value, they may request a decrease in the value of a letter of guarantee.

Use the **Create quotation**, **Sales quotation**, **Sales order**, **Purchase order**, or **Project details** form to request an increase or decrease in the value of the letter of guarantee. After making the request, use the **Letter of guarantee** form in **Bank** to increase or decrease the letter of guarantee value.
