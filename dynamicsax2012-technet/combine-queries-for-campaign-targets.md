# Combine queries for campaign targets 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can combine queries that you previously created, and then use the queries to select targets for the current campaign.

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Common** \> **Campaigns** \> **All campaigns**.

2.  In the **All campaigns** form, select the campaign for which you want to define targets.

3.  Click the **Targets** FastTab, and then click **Select targets**.

4.  In the **Campaign target contacts** form, under **Drop area**, click **Clear** to clear the **Expression** field.

5.  Drag the query from the **Queries** area to the **Expression** field under **Drop area**.
    
    You can also type the name of the query in the **Expression** field, instead of dragging the query.

6.  If there is more than one query in the **Expression** field, combine the results of the queries by using the buttons to insert logical operators.

7.  Click **Execute** to run the queries.
