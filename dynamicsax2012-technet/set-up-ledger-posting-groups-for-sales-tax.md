# Set up ledger posting groups for sales tax 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When transactions are posted, sales taxes are calculated and posted automatically to main accounts. The default ledger posting groups are defined when you attach a ledger posting group to each sales tax code, or to each sales tax jurisdiction, if the organization operates in the United States and uses this functionality.

Set up the sales tax ledger posting groups to fit the needs of the organization. You can set up individual ledger posting groups for each sales tax code. You can use one ledger posting group for all sales tax codes or assign multiple ledger posting groups to the sales tax codes.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Before you can set up the ledger posting groups, the main accounts that are used for sales taxes in the <STRONG>Main accounts - chart of accounts: %1</STRONG> form must be created.</P>
