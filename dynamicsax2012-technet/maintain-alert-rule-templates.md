# Maintain alert rule templates 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

After you have created alert rules, you can create templates that are based on the rules. If you have not yet created alert rules, see [Create alert rules](create-alert-rules.md).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>A user who creates a new alert rule can see the names of all alert rule templates, even though user group permissions do not allow the user to access some of those templates. Therefore, choose the names of company account templates carefully. For example, avoid names that include the word "commission" if not all users are supposed to know that some employees in the company have a commission-based salary.</P>



## Create an alert rule template

1.  Click **File** \> **Tools** \> **Manage alert rules**.

2.  On the **Overview** tab, right-click the rule to base the template on, and then select **Record info**.

3.  In the **Record information** form, click **System template**.

4.  In the **Create template** dialog box, enter a name and description for the alert rule template, and then click **OK**.
    
    The templates that you create are available to all users who have access to the current company account.
