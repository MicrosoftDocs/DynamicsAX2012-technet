# (RUS) Set up aggregation parameters for registering POS sales and return transactions in Microsoft Dynamics AX 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can set up the aggregation parameters that are used to aggregate the point of sale (POS) sales and return transactions when the transactions are registered in Microsoft Dynamics AX. When you select the aggregation parameters, Microsoft Dynamics AX registers sales orders for the POS sales and return transactions in the following ways:

  - When you perform sales transactions and return transactions in the same shift, Microsoft Dynamics AX aggregates the positive sales quantities and negative return quantities for items that have identical inventory dimensions.

  - When you perform sales transactions and return transactions in different shifts, Microsoft Dynamics AX registers the positive sales quantities and negative return quantities for items that have identical inventory dimensions separately.

## Example

You perform the following transactions at the POS:

  - Five sales transactions for two units of item A each, generating five sales receipts.

  - Two return transactions for two original receipts that contain one unit of item A each, generating two return receipts in the same shift.

  - Three return transactions for one unit of item A each, generating three receipts in a different shift.

  - One return transaction for one unit of item A without generating a receipt in a different shift.

The following table displays how the transactions are registered in Microsoft Dynamics AX depending on the parameters that you select in the **Retail parameters** form.

## Set up aggregation parameters

Use this procedure to set up the aggregation parameters that are used to aggregate POS sales and return transactions in Microsoft Dynamics AX.

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Parameters** \> **Retail parameters**.

2.  Select the **Process as a return in the same shift** check box to process return transactions during a different shift in the same way that you process return transactions during the same shift.

3.  Click **Posting**, and then in the **Posting** area, in the **Aggregation** field group, select the **Voucher transactions** check box to aggregate voucher transactions.

4.  Select the **Sales and returns** check box to aggregate POS sales and return transactions.
