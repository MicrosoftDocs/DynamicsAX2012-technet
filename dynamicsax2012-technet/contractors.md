# Contractors 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic provides information about contractors in Microsoft Dynamics AX and answers questions that you might have before you set up workers.

## What is the difference between a contractor and an employee?

Employees and contractors are both types of workers. When you hire a worker, you must specify in Microsoft Dynamics AX if the worker is an employee or a contractor. A contractor is typically not on an organization’s payroll and is usually hired on a temporary basis, whereas an employee is on the organization’s payroll and does not have a specified employment end date.

## Can a contractor be assigned to positions in multiple companies?

Yes, a contractor can hold multiple positions in an organization. Those positions can be in a single company, or legal entity, or in multiple legal entities.

## Can a person who is a contractor in one company also be an employee in another company?

Yes, a worker can have employment relationships with two separate legal entities. One of those relationships can be as an employee and the other relationship can be as a contractor.

## I employ workers that I hire out as contractors to other people or organizations. Should I set up these workers as employees or contractors?

Generally, if a worker is on your payroll, the worker should be designated as an employee.
