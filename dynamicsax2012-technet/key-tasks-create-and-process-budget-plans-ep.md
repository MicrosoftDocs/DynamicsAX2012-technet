# Key tasks: Create and process budget plans (EP) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

A budget plan is a document that contains a header, budget plan lines, and line details. When you create a budget plan, it is automatically assigned a unique document number, and your name is displayed in the **Budget plan preparer** field. The budget planning process that you select and the responsibility center of the budget preparer determine the organization hierarchy and the budget planning workflow for the budget plan. After you have finished preparing a budget plan, you submit it to workflow. Then the budget plan, together with worksheets, justifications, and attachments, is automatically routed through your organization for review and approval.

## Use worksheets and justifications in budget plans

Microsoft Dynamics AX can be integrated with Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel by using the Office Add-ins for Microsoft Dynamics AX. Users can create Word justifications and Excel worksheets that are linked dynamically to the tables in Microsoft Dynamics AX. When you route a justification with a budget plan, reviewers can add comments and track changes in the document. You can import the data from a multiple scenarios, analyze and modify the data, and publish it back to the budget plan. Integration for the Office Add-ins must be set up before users can use the Office Add-ins to create files.

A template author creates templates for the worksheets and justifications. The templates contain fields from the budget plans. The worksheets and justifications that are created by using the templates contain the data from the budget plan that you are working with.

Each budget plan has one justification template that you can use to create justification documents for that budget plan. Each budget planning stage can have a different template that you can use to create a worksheet for that stage. When you save the worksheet, it automatically becomes a budget plan attachment.

When you create a justification, you can add information to support your budget plan. When you route the justification and the budget plan for review and approval, the reviewers can add comments and use change tracking to add information to the justification.

When you create a worksheet, you can import the data from multiple scenarios, analyze and modify the data, and then publish the data back to the budget plan. You can use a separate worksheet template for each budget planning stage, and the worksheets that you create are automatically attached to the budget plan before it is routed for review.
