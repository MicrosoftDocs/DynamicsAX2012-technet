# Create a configuration project by copying another project in RapidStart Services 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Beginning October 1, 2015, RapidStart services will no longer be supported. For more information, see the announcement on CustomerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/northamerica/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued or PartnerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/news-events/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued.

In Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services, you can create a configuration project to use to configure the set of parameter options and records for an implementation of any version of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. After you create a configuration project, you can make a copy of that project and use it as the basis for other projects. You can make a copy of an existing project either before or after the questions in the source configuration project have been answered.

For information about why you might choose to copy a configuration project, see the topic [Learn about configuration projects in RapidStart Services](learn-about-configuration-projects-in-rapidstart-services.md).

1.  In your browser, open online services at [http://www.dynamicsonline.com](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=141031).

2.  Click **For Customers**, and then click **Sign in**.

3.  Sign in by using the Microsoft account (formerly WindowsLive ID) that is associated with your customer account in online services.

4.  If your logon credentials are associated with more than one organization in RapidStart Services, on the **Choose your organization** page, click the name of the organization to work with.

5.  On the Customer Portal dashboard, click **Microsoft DynamicsÂ® RapidStart**.

6.  On the **Getting started** page, follow one of these steps:
    
      - In the left pane, click **Open existing project**.
    
      - In the main area, click **Open an existing project**.

7.  On the **Projects** page, click the row of the configuration project to copy.
    

    > [!TIP]
    > <P>By default, the project list displays only the projects that you created. To see all configuration projects that have been created for your organization, in the <STRONG>Current view</STRONG> list, select <STRONG>All projects</STRONG>.</P>



8.  Click **Copy project**.

9.  In the **Copy project** form, in the **New name** field, enter a name for the new project.

10. In the list of functional areas, select the check box for each functional area to include in the new configuration project.

11. Click **Copy**.

After the new project has been created, you can access the project from the list of projects. You can then begin making any changes that are required for the target deployment of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012.
