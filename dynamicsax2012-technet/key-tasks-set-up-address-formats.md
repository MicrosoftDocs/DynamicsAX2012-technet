# Key tasks: Set up address formats 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Because there are multiple address format types, for example countries and regions and states and provinces, your organization must have the flexibility to adjust to an address format when displaying a postal address. You can use the **Address setup** form to set up all postal address information for your organization. Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Addresses** \> **Address setup**.

## What do you want to do?

Set up address formats

Set up country/region information

Set up state/province information

Set up county information

Set up city information

Set up district information

Set up ZIP/postal code information

## Set up address formats

Use this section of the form to enter and set up address component information and formatting. As you enter address information for a selected address type, the **Address** field in the upper-right pane displays how the address will appear.

1.  In the **Address setup** form, select **Address format** in the left pane.

2.  In the upper pane, click **New** to add a new address format type.

3.  Enter the address format type name and a brief description.
    
    For example, you might enter NO in the **Address format** field and enter Norway in the **Description** field.

4.  In the lower pane, click **New** to configure a new address component for the address format type that is selected in the upper pane.

5.  In the **Address application object** field, select the first object that must appear when an address for this format is displayed. For example, **Street** .

6.  In the **Separator** field, enter the character that should separate this object from the next object when the address is displayed. For example, a comma.

7.  Select the check boxes to indicate the following:
    
      - **New line** – Display this object on a new line.
    
      - **Data entry only** – Display this object only when entering the address. If this check box is selected, the object will not be displayed when the address is printed.
    
      - **Not active** – Do not use this object in an address for the selected format type.
    
      - **Expand** – Display the name of the country/region, state, or county instead of the assigned code.
    
      - **Special** – Indicates that the field contains the same separator characters.
