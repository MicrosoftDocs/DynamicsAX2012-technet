# View service object relations 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use the **Service object relations** page to view a list of the service object relations that have been created for a service agreement or order. You can then use the **Service object** page to view the details of the service object that is associated with the service object relation.

Service objects are the general objects that you can perform a service on. For example, you might perform repair tasks for machinery or buildings, or consultant tasks for a set of accounts or for a legal document.

A service object relation is the specific object of the service. It is used to associate a service object with a service agreement or service order. This relationship is set up when a service object relation is created for a service agreement or order, and then service objects are added to the service object relation. When you add a service object relation to a service agreement or order, the service object can be associated to the service agreement or order lines. A template BOM can also be specified for a service object relation. This is a list of components for service object that are serviced regularly.
