# (BRA) About referenced processes 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can include information about referenced processes in the Documento Auxiliar da Nota Fiscal Eletrônica (DANFE) and Sistema Público de Escrituração Digital (SPED) fiscal reports. The referenced process number is the number of the fiscal process at the Brazilian government agency that authorizes the fiscal operation.

You can perform the following tasks to set up and include referenced process information in fiscal documents:

  - Create a fiscal document source text by specifying agency and reference process number information. For more information, see [(BRA) Set up a fiscal document source text](bra-set-up-a-fiscal-document-source-text.md).

  - Attach the agency and reference process number information to a free text invoice when you attach a fiscal document text to the free text invoice. For more information, see [(BRA) Attach fiscal document texts to a free text invoice](bra-attach-fiscal-document-texts-to-a-free-text-invoice.md).

  - Attach the agency and reference process number information to a sales order or purchase order when you attach a fiscal document text to the sales order or purchase order. For more information, see [(BRA) Attach fiscal document texts to a fiscal document](bra-attach-fiscal-document-texts-to-a-fiscal-document.md).
