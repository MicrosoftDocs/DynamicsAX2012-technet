# View the shopping cart 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use Enterprise Portal to order items online. Before placing your order, you must add the items to your shopping cart. For more information, see [Add items to the shopping cart](add-items-to-the-shopping-cart.md). You then can use the **Shopping cart** page to view the items that are currently in your shopping cart, and make changes to the items or delivery information before placing your order.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you have items in your cart but you do not place an order, these items are not available in your cart the next time you log on to Enterprise Portal. This depends on how Enterprise Portal is set up.</P>



1.  Click **Shopping cart** on the Quick Launch. The **Shopping cart** page is displayed, where you can view the potential order lines for the items in your shopping cart.

2.  Modify the item configuration and quantity for each item order line, if needed. The item configuration is a combination of properties for an item, such as color and size.

3.  Click **Add** to add more items to the shopping cart.

4.  Click **Checkout** to place your order. For more information, see [Place your order](place-your-order.md).
