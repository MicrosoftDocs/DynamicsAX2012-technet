[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

After an original project budget or budget revision is submitted for approval, you can use the **Workflow history** form to view details about the status and history of the budget workflow. Additionally, you can reassign a workflow task to another worker or cancel the workflow for a project budget.

1.  Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Common** \> **Projects** \> **All projects**.

2.  Select or open a project. On the **Action Pane**, on the **Plan** tab, in the **Budget** group, click **Project budget**.

3.  In the **Project budget** form, click **Actions**, and then click **View history**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>After a budget revision for a project is sent to a workflow for approval, you can also open the <STRONG>Workflow history</STRONG> form from the <STRONG>Project budget revision</STRONG> form.</P>



4.  In the upper pane, select one of the following options:
    
      - **Resume** – Resume a workflow that stopped because of an error.
    
      - **Recall** – Permanently stop a workflow. When you recall a workflow, the system no longer recognizes that the budget or budget revision was ever submitted to the workflow.
    
      - **Refresh** – Refresh the list of active workflows.

5.  In the lower pane, select one of the following options:
    
      - **Work items** – View the instructions for the work items for a workflow stage. To assign a work item to another worker, click **Reassign**.
    
      - **Tracking details** – View detailed information about each stage of the workflow for a project budget.
