# What's new in Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services lets partners and customers configure an installation of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 by using a cloud-based, interview-style questionnaire. The questionnaire uses general terminology about business processes instead of terms that are specific to Microsoft Dynamics AX. Partners, independent software vendors (ISVs), and customers can create, maintain, and reuse configurations that reflect their custom solutions. Partners can also create additional groups of questions to enlarge the scope of a configuration.

RapidStart Services is hosted on the [Online services for Microsoft Dynamics ERP website](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=141031).

For more information, see [Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services](microsoft-dynamics-erp-rapidstart-services.md).

## March 2014 update for Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services

In the March 2014 release of Lifecycle Services, support for creating and opening RapidStart Services projects for Microsoft Dynamics AX was added to the Lifecycle Services project page. You no longer have to use the Online services for Microsoft Dynamics ERP website.
