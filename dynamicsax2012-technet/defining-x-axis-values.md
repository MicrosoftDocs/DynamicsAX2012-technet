# Defining x-axis values 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Setup** \> **Sales management** \> **Query administration**. Click **Allowed fields**.

You can define the x-axis values for your calculations in the **Query administration** form.

In the **Allowed fields** form, you can select the fields that you want to plot on the x-axis only, on the y-axis only, or on both the x-axis and y-axis.

Fields that are plotted on the x-axis must be used for data such as dates, customers and vendors, or employee names. Methods, such as revenue and won quotations, can only be plotted on the y-axis.
