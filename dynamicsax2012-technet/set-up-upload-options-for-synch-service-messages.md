# Set up upload options for Synch Service messages 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

Commerce Data Exchange: Real-time Service is used by Commerce Data Exchange: Synch Service to upload status messages to Microsoft Dynamics AX. You control whether this upload occurs, and how often it occurs, by selecting a set of upload options for each Synch Service profile. For more information about how to set up a profile, see [Set up a profile for Synch Service](set-up-a-profile-for-synch-service.md).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Synch Service is required for Retail only in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 and Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack. In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, this component is used only to support previous versions of Retail POS while you upgrade (N-1).</P>
