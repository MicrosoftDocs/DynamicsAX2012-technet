# About print management document types and modules 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Print management works with several modules. These include Accounts receivable, Accounts payable, and Project management and accounting. You can see the supported documents for each module in the **Print management setup** form. For example, in Accounts receivable, the following documents are supported:

  - **Collection letter note**

  - **Confirmation**

  - **Customer account statement**

  - **Customer invoice**

  - **Free text invoice**

  - **Interest note**

  - **Quotation**

  - **Sales agreement confirmation**

  - **Sales order confirmation**

  - **Sales order packing slip**


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The <STRONG>Confirmation</STRONG> and <STRONG>Quotation</STRONG> document types are also used in Sales and marketing.</P>



You can set up print management original records, copy records, and conditional settings at the module, account, or transaction level.

Setting up print management at the module level requires the least amount of setup and minimizes the maintenance work when you have to change the settings, such as when you install new printers or change your existing printers. However, if your business needs require it, you can override the module settings for specific accounts or individual transactions.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you set up print management at the account or transaction level, the setup information will be more complex to manage when you add or change printers because you will have to change the settings for each individual account or transaction.</P>



## Configuration keys

Print management support for documents in the **Print management setup** form is controlled by the following configuration keys.
