# Party upgrade [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A party is a person or organization that can be internal or external to your organization. Each party has its own record within Microsoft Dynamics AX. In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, every customer, vendor, prospect, and competitor must be categorized as either a person or an organization. When you are upgrading to Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, all customer, vendor, prospect, and competitor records are assigned the party type **Organization** by default.

Use this form to indicate any customers, vendors, prospects, and competitors that should be categorized as a **Person** party type and to verify the name components for each **Person** party record. You can also use this form to specify the name sequence, for example, First, Middle, Last, that will be used on a **Person** party record. **Person** party records also include contacts and employees.

1.  Click **Party Upgrade** to open the **Party upgrade** form.

2.  In the **Select the default person name sequence** field, select the sequence in which you want names to be displayed for a **Person** party record.

3.  In the **Type** field, update any party records whose record type is changing from **Organization** to **Person**.

4.  After you have updated all your party records, click **Set to ready for upgrade**.
