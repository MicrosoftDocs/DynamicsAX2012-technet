# Add a Customer administrator to a service in RapidStart Services 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Beginning October 1, 2015, RapidStart services will no longer be supported. For more information, see the announcement on CustomerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/northamerica/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued or PartnerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/news-events/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued.

This topic explains how a Partner implementation expert can make RapidStart Services available to customers and prospects by using online services for Microsoft Dynamics ERP.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> <P>In the March 2014 release of Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services, support for creating and opening RapidStart Services projects for Microsoft Dynamics AX was added to the Lifecycle Services project page. You can use the online services for Microsoft Dynamics ERP website as described in the rest of this topic, or you can use Lifecycle Services instead.</P>
> <P>To use Lifecycle Services, visit <A href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=306503">Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services</A>.</P>



## Prerequisites

Before you start this process, you must do the following:

  - Complete the steps in the [Activate your Partner Portal account for Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services](activate-your-partner-portal-account-for-microsoft-dynamics-erp-rapidstart-services.md) topic.

  - Identify the person who will act as the Customer administrator for RapidStart Services. This person might be someone from the customer organization. Alternatively, someone from a partner organization can work on behalf of the customer, provided that they use a different Microsoft account from the one that they use for their partner login.
    
    The Customer administrator must provide you with the ID for the Microsoft account that is used to sign in to CustomerSource. This is the ID that you must enter during the registration process. Make sure that the Customer administrator gives you only the ID for the Microsoft account and **not the password**.

After you add the customer in online services for Microsoft Dynamics ERP, the Customer administrator receives an email message from dynamicsonline@microsoft.com. This message contains an activation link that is used to complete the process. The link opens a web page, where the customer must sign in by using the Microsoft account that you entered when you registered the customer.

After the Customer administrator signs in, he or she reviews and agrees to the online services agreement and privacy statement, and then signs in to Customer Portal. In Customer Portal, other users in the customer organization can be added and assigned to roles.

## Make RapidStart Services available to customers and prospects

1.  In your browser, open online services at [http://www.dynamicsonline.com](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=141031), and sign in to Partner Portal. If the **Getting Started – Partner Portal for Microsoft Dynamics® ERP** page is displayed, click **Create a new customer**.

2.  On the **Customers** page, on the **Action Pane**, click **New Customer**. Then, depending on whether you are enrolling an existing customer or a prospective customer, follow the instructions in this table.
    
    To use RapidStart Services in your own partner organization, you must add yourself as a new customer and use the procedure for enrolling a prospect.

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>When you create a customer account here without adding a VOICE account number, the RapidStart Services service remains active for only 90 days.

If you don’t add the VOICE number within 90 days, the account is inactivated. Microsoft retains the data for the account for an additional 30 days. If you contact Support and provide the customer’s VOICE account number during that time, you can reactivate the account and continue to work with the data.</P>
