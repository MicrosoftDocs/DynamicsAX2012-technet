# Carry forward project budgets at year-end 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

At the end of the year, you can transfer any remaining budget amounts for multiyear projects to future years. You can also create budget register details for those amounts in the associated general ledger accounts.

We recommend that you review and analyze the remaining budget amounts before you process them.

## Review and analyze remaining budget amounts

Complete the following steps if you want to review the year-end budget amounts for projects, but you are not ready to carry the amounts forward.

1.  Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Periodic** \> **Budgets** \> **Carry forward budgets**.

2.  In the **Project budget carry-forward process** form, in the **Year-end option** group, clear the **Carry forward remaining project budget amounts** check box.

3.  In the **Project parameters** group, in the **Project budget year** field, select the beginning of the fiscal year for which you want to view the remaining budget amounts.

4.  In the **General ledger** group, in the **Opening fiscal year** field, select the beginning of the fiscal year for which you want to view the remaining budget amounts for the projects.

5.  In the **Copy from/to** group, complete the following steps:
    
    1.  In the **From forecast model** field, select the forecast model that is associated with the remaining budget amounts that you want to review for the projects.
    
    2.  If you want to include, among the projects that are displayed in the pane at the bottom of the form, projects that have no remaining budget amounts, but that meet the other criteria that you select, select the **Show zero remaining** check box.

6.  Above the pane at the bottom of the form, click **Retrieve all budgets** to load all budgets that match the criteria that you selected.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If you prefer to design a database query that loads a specific set of budgets into the pane, click <STRONG>Retrieve selected budgets</STRONG>.</P>



7.  To see more information about a specific line in the pane, select the line, and then click **View budget details** or **View accounts**.

## Carry forward remaining budget amounts to a future year

When you process your remaining budget amounts, you can decide whether you want to create transactions in the general ledger for the amounts that you carry forward. If you do not want to create general ledger transactions, complete the steps in the first procedure in this section. If you do want to create general ledger transactions, complete the steps in the second procedure.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Budget amounts that are carried forward are transferred to the forecast model that is selected as the carry-forward forecast model in the <STRONG>Forecast models</STRONG> form.</P>
