# Configure project budget overrun settings 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The default setting for project budgets enables users to post a transaction even if the transaction will cause a budget overrun. However, when you create a budget for a project, you can override the default overrun selections.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>When you change the default overrun option, the change applies only to new projects. The overrun option on existing projects is not affected.</P>



## Define the default overrun option for all new projects

1.  Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Setup** \> **Project management and accounting parameters**.

2.  In the **Project management and accounting parameters** form, click **Cost control**.

3.  In the **Budget control** section, in the **Budget overrun default** field, select the overrun option that you want to use as the default for all new projects from the following options:
    
      - **Disallow overruns** – Users cannot enter a transaction.
    
      - **Warn of overruns** – Users receive a warning when they enter a transaction. The transaction is processed normally.
    
      - **Allow overruns** – Users do not receive a warning when they enter a transaction. The transaction is processed normally.

## Define an overrun option for specific user groups and projects or project groups

If you define overrun options for specific user groups or projects in the **Project budget settings for user groups** form, those selections override the selections that you make in the **Project management and accounting parameters** form.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> <P>If a user is a member of two groups that have different options for the same project or project group, the user is granted the more permissive option.</P>



1.  Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Setup** \> **Project management and accounting parameters**.

2.  In the **Project management and accounting parameters** form, click **Cost control**.

3.  In the **Budget control** section, click **Settings...**.

4.  In the **Project budget settings for user groups** form, in the **User group** field, select a user group to define the overrun option for.

5.  In the **Valid for** column, select a project option for the selected user group:
    
      - **Table** – The overrun option applies only to a specific project.
    
      - **Group** – The overrun option applies only to a specific project group.
    
      - **All** – The overrun option applies to all projects that do not have a different option specified in the **Projects** form.

6.  In the **Project/Project group** column, select the project or project group to define the overrun option for.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>This field is not available if <STRONG>All</STRONG> is selected in the <STRONG>Valid for</STRONG> column.</P>



7.  In the **Overrun option** column, select the option for the specified user group in the selected project or project group:
    
      - **Disallow overruns** – Users cannot enter a transaction.
    
      - **Warn of overruns** – Users receive a warning when they enter a transaction. The transaction is processed normally.
    
      - **Allow overruns** – Users do not receive a warning when they enter a transaction. The transaction is processed normally.
