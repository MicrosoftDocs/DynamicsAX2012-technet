<td><p>Seamless offline processing mode now available in supported Modern Point of Sale (POS) clients</p></td>
<td><p>Modern POS clients for Microsoft Dynamics AX Retail are now provisioned with a local database and a local instance of the Commerce Runtime (CRT). In the event that a Modern POS client cannot communicate with a Retail Server (either a local or centrally-hosted Retail Server) for normal CRT processing, the Modern POS client seamlessly shifts to offline processing mode. In offline processing mode, the local instance of the CRT and the local database perform operations such as processing transactions. When the connection to the Retail Server is restored, the Modern POS client automatically shifts processing back to the Retail Server and the channel database for normal operations.  </p>

> [!WARNING]
> <P>Due to the database and CRT footprint on the Modern POS device, offline processing includes a subset of normal processing with a subset of data.</P>

<td><p>Self-service deployment for store components</p></td>
<td><p>In AX 2012 R3 and previous releases of AX 2012, setting up a new retail store or updating the software at existing stores is a long and complicated process. A system administrator must install multiple Retail components on multiple computers at each store. It can take days to install and configure all of the required components on all affected computers.</p>
<p>In CU8, a self-service deployment option is available. In a self-service deployment, users at each store can easily install the software that is required at the store. At headquarters, the system administrator plans the topology of the store and the software that must be installed on each computer. Then the system administrator enters deployment information in Microsoft Dynamics AX.</p>
<p>The user at the store is provided with basic information about how to deploy the components that the administrator has specified, including a URL where the user can download an installation package and a password to securely decode the installation package. The user goes to each computer in the store and runs the installation package. Special permissions and knowledge of the deployment topology are not necessary to complete the deployment.</p></td>

<td><p>Commerce Data Exchange</p></td>
<td><p>The following updates and improvements were made to Commerce Data Exchange in AX 2012 R3. For more information, see <a href="commerce-data-exchange.md">Commerce Data Exchange</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Commerce Data Exchange architecture</strong></p>
<p>In earlier releases, Synch Service was a Windows service that was installed at headquarters and at stores. In AX 2012 R3, Synch Service is replaced by two components, Commerce Data Exchange: Async Server and Commerce Data Exchange: Async Client:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Async Server is a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service that is installed at headquarters and hosted in Internet Information Services (IIS). Because the service is hosted in IIS, you can take advantage of the scalability and reliability features of IIS, such as load balancing.</p></li>
<li><p>Async Client is a Windows service that is installed at the channel.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Database architecture</strong></p>
<p>In earlier releases, store databases and online channel databases differed from each other. In AX 2012 R3, store databases, online channel databases, and any other channel-specific databases are just known as channel databases. A channel database can contain data for one or more channels, and the same channel can be included in more than one channel database.</p>
<p><strong>Change tracking</strong></p>
<p>In earlier releases, preactions and actions were used to collect updates to data in the Microsoft Dynamics AX database. In AX 2012 R3, Microsoft SQL Server change tracking is used instead. Because preactions and actions have been eliminated, fewer records are created in the Microsoft Dynamics AX database, and performance is improved.</p>
<p><strong>Retail Scheduler jobs</strong></p>
<p>In earlier releases, three types of scheduler jobs were available:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A-jobs used actions and preactions to transfer only changed data from Microsoft Dynamics AX to a channel.</p></li>
<li><p>N-jobs were used to transfer all data from Microsoft Dynamics AX to a channel, regardless of whether the data had changed.</p></li>
<li><p>P-jobs were used to transfer data from the point of sale to Microsoft Dynamics AX.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In AX 2012 R3, only two types of jobs are available, and jobs no longer use the prefixes A, N, and P:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Outgoing jobs are used to send data from Microsoft Dynamics AX to channels.</p></li>
<li><p>Incoming jobs are used to receive data from channels into Microsoft Dynamics AX.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data distribution</strong></p>
<p>In earlier releases, an instance of Synch Service at the head office read data from Microsoft Dynamics AX and sent that data to a channel instance of Synch Service. In AX 2012 R3, data transfer is asynchronous and is initiated by the client.</p>
<p>Based on a distribution schedule, data packages are generated from Microsoft Dynamics AX and deposited in a file storage system. At a regular interval, Async Client checks with Async Server to determine whether there are new data packages. If there is new data, Async Client takes the data from the storage location and applies it to the local channel database.</p>
<p>Therefore, you no longer have to use static IP addresses or name resolution in the store to enable instances of Synch Service to communicate with each other. Additionally, because Async Client does not communicate directly with Microsoft Dynamics AX, .NET Business Connector is no longer required.</p>
<p>To reduce the number of data packages that are generated, you can group retail channel databases. When you create a group of channel databases, the data is created one time for the group, and then multiple channels can pick it up. For example, stores in the same region or of the same type can use the same data, and therefore can be grouped.</p>
<p><strong>Troubleshooting data distribution issues</strong></p>
<p>Several new forms are available to help you troubleshoot data distribution issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Async Server connection status</strong> – This form in Microsoft Dynamics AX shows the last date and time that each instance of Async Client connected to Async Server to check for updates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Download sessions</strong> and <strong>Upload sessions</strong> – These forms in Microsoft Dynamics AX show detailed status information for each data transfer. For example, the forms show when a data package was created, when a data package was uploaded or downloaded, and when a data package was applied to the destination database.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Download history</strong> – This form shows detailed status information for a selected distribution schedule.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see <a href="view-history-for-a-distribution-schedule.md">View history for a distribution schedule</a> or <a href="view-or-cancel-retail-data-distribution-sessions.md">View or cancel retail data distribution sessions</a>.</p></td>

<tr class="even">
<td><p>Retail Server</p></td>
<td><p>Retail Server is the primary server-side component for Retail Modern POS. This feature processes business logic for Retail Modern POS. Retail Server is to Retail Modern POS clients what Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Object Server (AOS) is to Microsoft Dynamics AX clients. You can deploy Retail Server in a store or in a data center. Retail Server must communicate with a software component of AX 2012 R3 that is named Retail Hardware Station.</p>

<td><p>Support for multiple stores in different languages</p></td>
<td><p>Developers and IT professionals can create multiple Retail online stores that support different currencies and translations, such as translated terms and product listings. These stores can be located in the same SharePoint farm. Therefore, businesses and organizations can sell products in native languages, report financials for different countries, and maximize hardware purchases. Online stores in different languages can connect to the same or different channel databases, and to the same or different product catalog sites.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Additional controls for Retail online stores that are published to Microsoft SharePoint</p></td>
<td><p>The Retail SDK has been updated to contain code for new controls. These controls include a size picker, a zoom control, a category landing page, and category promotions. You can modify and reuse these controls when you customize a Retail online store.</p>
<p>For more information, see the section titled <strong>Extend an online store</strong> in <a href="online-store.md">Online Store</a>.</p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Mass deployment</p></td>
<td><p>In earlier releases of Retail, there was no easy method for deploying Retail components to multiple computers. For example, Retail POS software had to be installed manually on every register in a store. This process could be time-consuming and could create an inconsistent implementation.</p>
<p>In AX 2012 R3, you can use System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) to automate and centralize the deployment of Retail components. This process is scalable to many components and computers. You can set up topology and configuration information in Microsoft Dynamics AX, and then deploy the correct configuration to all computers by using SCCM.</p>
<p>The following components can be deployed by using SCCM:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Real-time Service</p></li>
<li><p>Synch Service</p></li>
<li><p>Async Server</p></li>
<li><p>Async Client</p></li>
<li><p>Channel databases</p></li>
<li><p>Retail POS (including offline databases)</p></li>
<li><p>Retail Modern POS</p></li>
<li><p>Retail Server</p></li>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Retail monitoring in System Center Operations Manager</p></td>
<td><p>You can now monitor your Retail environment by using System Center Operations Manager. The System Center Management Pack for Retail in AX 2012 R3 provides a monitoring solution for Microsoft Dynamics AX Retail components. The management pack automatically discovers the Retail components in your environment, and monitors the configuration and availability of those components. The management pack provides early warnings that an operator can use to proactively identify issues that can affect the availability of the Retail system.

<p>This feature enhances the existing functionality for info codes by letting you group info codes. Info code groups add flexibility, because you can define fewer info codes but use them in more versatile ways. Info code groups let you perform the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Define fewer info codes and easily reuse them. Info codes that are included in info code groups have no hard-coded dependencies on other info codes. You can include the same info code in multiple info code groups and then use prioritization to present the same info codes in the order that makes sense for your various information gathering requirements.</p></li>

If the call center functionality is enabled, you can void gift card transactions. Funds can be added to gift cards that are sold through either the call center or the retail point of sale.</p>
<p>Gift cards that are purchased from a store that belongs to one legal entity can now be redeemed in a store that belongs to a different legal entity, if those stores support intercompany transactions.</p>
<p>If your organization supports intercompany transactions, you can set up one company as the parent company. This company can hold the liability for all gift card sales from all stores that are participating in the gift card program. The other stores can be assigned to a different legal entity, but they must roll up to the parent company’s legal entity. When gift cards are sold or redeemed, the liability is increased or decreased accordingly in the parent company by using intercompany posting rules. When statements are posted for retail channels, the liability is increased for the parent company. When payments are made by using the gift card, the liability is decreased for the parent company.</p>

The products that are included in a kit are referred to as components. The set of products that make up a product kit are referred to as kit configurations. One product kit can have one or more configurations.</p>
<p>After you define the kit configurations, you release the product kit to your legal entities and set up any product properties for the kit. You can price the kit by using the sum of the base price of the kit components when they are added to the kit, or you can set an overall kit price. The kit price can also be adjusted at the time of sale if additional charges apply for products that are substituted for a standard kit component.</p>
<p>After the kit is created and priced, you can generate assembly orders to send the assembly and packaging instructions to the warehouse, so that the kits can be picked, packed, and shipped to the stores. After the kit configurations are approved, assembly orders can be manually generated at the warehouse or from a sales order if kit components are out of stock. Product kits can also be disassembled at the POS register or at the warehouse.</p>
<p>When assembly or disassembly orders are created and processed, bill of materials (BOM) journals are generated to create the required inventory transactions.</p>

## Retail essentials

Retail essentials provides a new, retail-centric configuration option for Microsoft Dynamics AX. Retail essentials provides a simplified, streamlined user experience that is optimized for organizations that will use only the retail management functions of Microsoft Dynamics AX.

Retail essentials is ideal for companies with less complex requirements that need to manage store-only environments. In this configuration, access to typical Microsoft Dynamics AX functions is limited. Additionally, omni-channel retail capabilities such as e-commerce are not available.

The following sections describe the highlights of the retail-centric experience.

## Retail-centric user interface

Retail essentials includes just enough functionality to enable POS operations, provide retail user rights, and perform other functions that retailers require. Users of Retail essentials see only one area page when they open AX 2012 R3. This area page is designed to provide access to all the components that are required for retail management from one location. Users do not have to be familiar with other areas of the product or access other modules. Additionally, some forms have been simplified so that they show only fields, functions, and labels that are relevant to retail.

## Easier deployment

A Retail deployment requires setup in many areas that aren't directly related to retail. By contrast, the initialization process for Retail essentials automatically configures reference data in over 40 areas of Microsoft Dynamics AX. Therefore, deployment time is significantly reduced, and forms and fields that are used only for initial setup can be omitted.

## Integration with existing accounting systems

If you already have an accounting system, Retail essentials makes it easy to provide critical financial data to the primary accounting system. For example, you can use accounting export functionality to provide account-level sales data to your accounting system. By using built-in accounts, you can create profiles to map totals from Retail essentials to an account in the accounting system. At required intervals, account activity can be exported to a directory that is available to the accounting system. The accounting system can then obtain the totals and post to the appropriate accounts.

## Capability to expand the system

Retail essentials can support your future software requirements and new business endeavors. Management of multiple systems in a complex environment can be expensive, and systems become obsolete over time. By using Retail essentials, you can decide when and how system consolidation occurs.

Retail essentials has Microsoft Dynamics AX at its core. All the capabilities that are provided through Microsoft Dynamics AX are available to Retail essentials, and you can easily enable these capabilities by modifying the user interface.

## Data migration from another retail system

Retail essentials uses the Microsoft Dynamics AX Data Import/Export Framework to provide an easy way to import retail-specific data. By default, entities are mapped for users who are migrating from Microsoft Dynamics Retail Management System (RMS). To import RMS data into Retail essentials, you must add the Data Import/Export Framework to your Retail essentials installation, create an ODBC connection to the RMS headquarters database, then use Data Import/Export Framework entities to migrate the data. For more information, see [Migrate data from Microsoft Dynamics Retail Management System (Retail essentials)](migrate-data-from-microsoft-dynamics-retail-management-system-retail-essentials.md).

To migrate data from a third-party retail system, you must create entity mappings that are specific to the data in the third-party system. However, the architecture is optimized so that this data can be mapped to staging tables in Retail essentials. The data import/export framework then creates the data correctly. For more information, see [Use the Data import/export framework to migrate data (Retail essentials)](use-the-data-import-export-framework-to-migrate-data-retail-essentials.md).

However, in earlier releases, you could only post the statement based on the calendar day. If your store operating hours extended past 12:00 AM, two sales orders are created when you posted the statement. One sales order was created for sales transactions that occurred before 12:00 AM, and the other sales order was created for the transactions that occurred between 12:00 AM and the end of the business day.</p>
<p>This feature lets you configure your statement posting process so that you can post the statements based on the end of the business day instead of the end of the calendar day.</p>

Although earlier releases required that all stores be upgraded at the same time, AX 2012 R2 supports operations that use two versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX POS software at the same time. Multi-version support lets upgrade administrators upgrade one store at a time while maintaining regular operations in stores that are still awaiting upgrade.</p>

## E-commerce investments in R2

AX 2012 R2 includes a suite of features that help you deploy, manage, and customize an online sales channel that is fully integrated with Microsoft Dynamics AX. E-commerce investments include two starter online stores which are built on Microsoft SharePoint 2013 Products, developer tools, and administrative and runtime components that integrate the online channel with Microsoft Dynamics AX.

By using this new suite of e-commerce features, you can centrally manage products, merchandising, and order fulfillment for all aspects of your online sales channel in Microsoft Dynamics AX. The runtime components are designed to deliver content and retail services in a scalable way. The starter online store (the Contoso electronics store) accelerates the development of highly customized online channels. The starter online store includes the patterns and best practices that are required for production-ready deployments. These patterns and best practices include powerful, search-driven, adaptive experiences that are offered by the SharePoint 2013 for Internet Sites (FIS) platform.

## E-commerce centralized management

The following table shows the features in AX 2012 R2 that can help you manage your online channel.

</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Channel management and publishing</p></td>
<td><p>Channel management lets you define an organizational entity in Microsoft Dynamics AX and associate that entity with an online website. Therefore, you can manage catalogs, prices, promotions, and other content for a brick-and-mortar channel and an online channel in one place. Channel management also lets you define default properties for a channel, such as a default profile for an anonymous shopper, the navigation hierarchy, and payment processing configurations.</p>
<p>Channel publishing lets you publish data and properties for a channel to a website, regardless of where that website is hosted. The data and properties that you can publish include the navigation hierarchy. For example, all Microsoft Dynamics AX administration for a Contoso channel is performed in offices that are located in Seattle, but the data center that hosts Contoso.com is located in Chicago. In this case, administrators can seamlessly manage and publish data from Microsoft Dynamics AX to the data center.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Catalog management and publishing, and attribute enhancement</p></td>
<td><p>Catalog management in this version of Microsoft Dynamics AX lets you create product collections, and target those collections at a specific channel or a promotion in a channel. For example, Contoso.com, an electronics retailer, creates a base catalog for all the electronics that are sold through its online channel. The catalog manager can then create a subcatalog for 60 items that will go on sale for a special promotion during the month of June. A single channel can have multiple catalogs. Likewise, one product can be located in multiple catalogs, and product details such as a promotion price can be determined by date.</p>
<p>Catalog publishing lets a catalog manager publish all catalog data to a specific endpoint that was defined through the channel management process that was described earlier. This data includes rich attributes and merchandising content.</p>
<p>Attribute enhancement lets you create attributes and rich content, so that you can market products in the context of the intended sales channel. The attributes and rich content that you can create includes images, extended descriptions, features, and specifications.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Navigation hierarchies and category attributes</p></td>
<td><p>Navigation hierarchies provide a logical taxonomy of categories and subcategories, so that you can group products in a manner that promotes discoverability for users who browse your online store. For example, Contoso.com creates a <strong>Products</strong> category that includes the <strong>Televisions</strong>, <strong>Computers &amp; Tablets</strong>, <strong>Modern Phones</strong>, and <strong>Video Games</strong> subcategories. Navigation hierarchies add an organizing structure to an already rich set of retail categories that are optimized for administrative and reporting purposes.</p>
<p>Category attributes provide a schema for logically describing products in a category. Category attributes enhance product refinement, filtering, and search optimization. For example, Contoso.com offers 40 different televisions. The catalog manager assigns category attributes such as <strong>LCD</strong>, <strong>Plasma</strong>, and <strong>Rear Projection</strong> to refine the category groupings even more, and to reduce duplication of effort and administrative overheard when the catalog is updated. Category attributes can also be configured to provide the automatic product filter groups (refinements) on the landing page of each category. For example, the catalog manager can configure refinement groups such as <strong>Television price</strong>, <strong>Television brand</strong>, and <strong>Screen size</strong>. These refinements can then be displayed on the website as a filter or a search refinement option for shoppers.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Deployment checklist</p></td>
<td><p>AX 2012 R2 includes a setup checklist for online stores. This checklist guides you through the process of setting up and configuring services and features for an online store. You can view the checklist in the AX 2012 R2 client by clicking <strong>Retail</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Online store setup checklist</strong>.</p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Categorize retail products</p></td>
<td><p>Retail products can now be categorized through the category management feature in AX 2012. You can categorize products by using a category hierarchy that is <em>n</em> levels deep. Multiple category hierarchies are supported for special circumstances.</p>
<p>You can more efficiently categorize your retail products. For example, you can create one main category hierarchy for all your retail products, and one or more supplemental category hierarchies for product promotions, vendor products, and so on.</p>
<p>Attributes that are assigned at the category level can be applied to all products in the category. Values that are assigned to a parent category can be inherited by a child category.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Product assortments</p></td>
<td><p>You can use the enhancements to products, category hierarchies, and organization hierarchies to more efficiently create and maintain assortments. A status and effective date were added. A new batch job was added for periodic updates of changes that are made to an assortment.</p>
<p>These enhancements let you centrally manage all retail products across legal entities. You can perform the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Efficiently group the stores and channels that assortments are assigned to by using the organization model.</p></li>
<li><p>Create multiple assortments by using category hierarchies.</p></li>
<li><p>Exclude selected products from an assortment.</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Retail channels</p></td>
<td><p>A retail channel includes the retail brick-and-mortar store, online store, and online marketplace. Retail channels are a subtype of operating units.</p>
<p>Use the organization hierarchy to model your store relationships and retail channels.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Price groups</p></td>
<td><p>Pricing for stores is accomplished by using price groups.</p>
<p>Trade agreements are configured by using price groups. Microsoft Dynamics AX for Retail POS uses trade agreements and the price groups that are assigned to the trade agreements to determine the base price for a product.</p>
<p>Price groups provide more flexibility when you set up product pricing. You can configure multiple price groups to meet the requirements of your various products and retail channels, and then assign one or more price groups to your stores.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Periodic discounts</p></td>
<td><p>AX 2012 Feature Pack includes the following enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Concurrency rules let you apply multiple discounts, such as exclusive, best price, and compounded discounts.</p></li>
<li><p>You can define periodic discounts by category, product, or product variant.</p></li>
<li><p>You can use discount codes (coupons) for online promotions in campaigns.</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Customer orders</p></td>
<td><p>Two types of customer orders, quotations and sales orders, are supported in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An order is created at a store and picked up at the same store.</p></li>
<li><p>An order is created at a store and picked up at a different store.</p></li>
<li><p>An order is created at a store and shipped to the customer.</p></li>
<li><p>An order is created online and picked up at a store.</p></li>
<li><p>Picking and packing workflows are started and completed in Retail POS.</p></li>
<li><p>Order returns or cancellations are processed in Retail POS.</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Inventory</p></td>
<td><p>The <strong>Add products</strong> form has been improved to support multiple product hierarchies and a new dialog box for selecting a variant matrix.

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Staff management</p></td>
<td><p>Retail staff in both the back office and the store are now integrated with the core <strong>Human resources</strong> module as workers. To simplify management of Retail POS permissions across the organization, jobs are associated with Retail POS permission groups. You can define a few standard jobs in your retail organization and have standard permissions for each job. All workers that you hire then automatically have the standard permissions. Additionally, you can associate workers with stores. Therefore, you can restrict a retail staff logon to a single store, a group of stores, or any store in the enterprise.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Store inventory</p></td>
<td><p>Retail store inventory has had major architectural changes to better suit native document support and to create a foundation for stronger retail store inventory functionality in the future. Retail store inventory (RSI) was originally a third-party handheld solution. The solution was then adapted into a module that was included in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 for Retail. RSI supported basic picking, receiving, and inventory counting, but was not optimized for Microsoft Dynamics AX. RSI required steps that made the solution less streamlined than other features of Retail.</p>
<p>For AX 2012, RSI is no longer a stand-alone module. The solution is now more intuitive, efficient, and adaptable, and provides a stronger foundation for developing end-to-end store inventory management. Additionally, functional improvements that have been made in Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX and Retail POS make data entry more intuitive and faster.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>End-of-day improvements</p></td>
<td><p>To help with auditing for loss prevention, retailers rely on a several different processes. Two of these will be addressed in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can assign a specific till to a specific cashier, so that one person is responsible for the till. For example, if a cashier returns from a break and is now assigned to a different register, the cashier must physically move the till, and the cashier’s shift must follow him or her. This scenario is known as <em>floating till</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>You can remove the till from the cash drawer without closing the shift, so that the money can be counted in a back room instead of on the sales floor. This scenario is known as <em>blind close</em>. In a blind close, multiple registers can be closed from one physical location. A single person can then count cash at the end of the day, and close all registers in a back room or another location that is away from the sales floor.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these key processes, several other improvements are addressed in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Important usability improvements have been made, such as an option to require starting and ending amounts before a shift can be closed. Additionally, there is an option to prompt for starting and ending amounts in Retail POS.</p></li>
<li><p>A ZZ-report has been added.</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Global address book</p></td>
<td><p>Addresses and contact information for retail entities have been migrated to addresses and contact information for parties.</p>
<p>The global address book significantly changes the data structures and relationships of the underlying data for addresses and contact information. For example, when a customer is created in Retail POS, the customer and party are both created, as are the associated addresses and contact information (party locations).</p></td>
