# (IND) Create a registration group 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

A tax registration group includes tax registration numbers for various tax types. The tax registration group is created to offset the tax amounts among the various tax types.

For example, you can create the following two tax registration groups.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Tax registration group</p></th>
<th><p>Tax type</p></th>
<th><p>Registration number</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>City one</p></td>
<td><p>Service tax</p></td>
<td><p>AAMES2696GST001</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p></p></td>
<td><p>Excise</p></td>
<td><p>AXRER8567NXM001</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p></p></td>
<td><p>VAT</p></td>
<td><p>29390361850</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>City two</p></td>
<td><p>Service tax</p></td>
<td><p>AAMES2696GST001</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p></p></td>
<td><p>Excise</p></td>
<td><p>AXRER5987NXM001</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p></p></td>
<td><p>VAT</p></td>
<td><p>29390361870</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


You select a tax registration group in the **Sales tax payment** form. Click **General ledger** \> **Periodic** \> **Sales tax payments** \> **Sales tax payments**. The **In use** check box for that tax registration group is then selected automatically in the **Tax registration group** form. A selected check box indicates that the registration group is being used. Another user cannot select the tax registration group for tax settlement until the check box is cleared.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>When the <STRONG>Sales tax payment</STRONG> form is open, you cannot clear the <STRONG>In use</STRONG> check box for the selected tax registration group. However, you can clear the <STRONG>In use</STRONG> check box if the tax settlement process stops abruptly. For example, tax settlement stops if the system is shut down.</P>
