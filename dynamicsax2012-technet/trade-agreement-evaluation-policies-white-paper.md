# Trade Agreement Evaluation Policies (White paper) 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This white paper explains implementation considerations for the Trade agreement evaluation (TAE) policies in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. TAE policies are used in the context of purchase orders, sales orders, and sales quotations. The policies prevent the system from accidentally evaluating and overwriting information in price and discount fields that is entered manually or by an external source.

Intended for developers and administrators, this white paper provides detailed information about how to apply TAE policies, the architecture of the policies, and how to extend and debug the policies.
