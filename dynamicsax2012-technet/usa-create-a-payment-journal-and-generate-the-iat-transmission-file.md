# (USA) Create a payment journal and generate the IAT transmission file 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When you process a payment to a vendor or refund a payment to a customer who is outside the United States, you must enter a payment transaction to generate the National Automated Clearing House Association – International ACH Transactions (NACHA-IAT) file. The key elements that cause an ACH transaction to be treated as an IAT transaction are the following:

  - A payment instruction is issued to create an ACH transaction.

  - The payment transaction is funded by, transmitted to, or received from a financial agency located outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.

  - A part of the transaction is processed through the United States ACH network.

## Create a payment journal

Create a payment journal to record payment transactions that use the IAT export format for the selected method of payment for the vendor or customer. For more information, see [Key tasks: Vendor payments and settlements](key-tasks-vendor-payments-and-settlements.md), [Reimbursements overview](reimbursements-overview.md), and [Refund customers overview](refund-customers-overview.md).

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Journals** \> **Payments** \> **Payment journal**.
    
    –or–
    
    Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Journals** \> **Payments** \> **Payment journal**.

2.  Create a new journal, and then click **Lines** to open the **Journal voucher** form. For more information, see [Create and validate journals and journal lines](create-and-validate-journals-and-journal-lines.md).

3.  In the **Debit** field, enter the payment amount.

4.  In the **Method of payment** field, select the payment method for NACHA IAT.

5.  Click the icon next to the **Method of payment** field to open the **NACHA IAT information** form. The icon is available only when you enter an amount in the **Debit** field and select the payment method that you created in the **Method of payment** field in the **Methods of payment - vendors** or **Methods of payment - customers** form.

6.  In the **Foreign exchange indicator** field, select the foreign exchange indicator from the following options:
    
      - **None** – Foreign exchange conversion is not used.
    
      - **FV** – Fixed to variable. The entry originates in a fixed-value amount and is received in a variable amount, based on the foreign exchange conversion.
    
      - **VF** – Variable to fixed. The entry originates in a variable-value amount, based on a specific foreign exchange rate for conversion to a fixed-value amount in which the entry is received.
    
      - **FF** – Fixed to fixed. The entry originates in a fixed-value amount and is received in the same fixed-value amount in the same currency. There is no foreign exchange conversion for entries transmitted using this code. For entries that originate in a fixed-value amount, the **Foreign exchange reference** field will be null or filled with spaces.

7.  In the **Foreign exchange reference indicator** field, select the foreign exchange reference indicator from the following options:
    
      - **1** – Foreign Exchange Rate
    
      - **2** – Foreign Exchange Reference Number
    
      - **3** – Null or spaces

8.  In the **Foreign exchange reference** field, enter the foreign exchange reference.

9.  In the **Gateway operator OFAC screening indicator** and **Secondary OFAC screening indicator** fields, select the gateway operator OFAC screening indicator value and the secondary OFAC screening indicator value.
