#### Property Value

Type: [System.Decimal](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/1k2e8atx\(v=ax.60\))  
Returns [Decimal](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/1k2e8atx\(v=ax.60\)).  

## Remarks

When there is a deposit on the order, it counts as credit towards the order. When picking up a product from store, the customer needs to pay whatever that item is worth (price + charges + taxes - discounts, etc). But as the customer has already pre-paid a portion of that item (in the form of a deposit) we need to account for it when calculating the amount due on pick up.

This property represents, on a pick up transaction, how much of the available prepayment can be used as credit when picking up the items.

A CO with $100 deposit, composed of $30 from item A, $20 from item B and $50 from item C. When the customer goes to the store and decides to pick up item A, it needs to pay the amount that A is worth, say $130 total (tax, price, discounts, etc).

However, the customer has already pre-paid $30 of item A in the form of a deposit. Now the customer needs to pay off the difference: $110 (the item worth amount less what he has paid as a deposit).
