# (EEUR) Post the pre-acquisition and acquisition of a fixed asset 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use the following procedures to create and post pre-acquisitions and acquisitions.

A pre-acquisition of a fixed asset is not depreciable, and it does not affect the acquisition costs and the net book value of the fixed asset. When you post a pre-acquisition, the status of the fixed asset changes to **Acquired**. A fixed asset that has the **Acquired** status is not depreciable. When you post an acquisition, the status changes to **Open**, and the fixed asset is depreciable.

To post pre-acquisitions, verify the following prerequisites:

  - Click **Fixed assets** \> **Setup** \> **Fixed assets parameters**. In the **Fixed assets** area, verify that the **Allow pre-acquisitions** check box is selected.

  - Click **Fixed assets** \> **Setup** \> **Fixed asset posting profiles**. Verify that a posting profile is set up for the **Pre-Acquisition** posting type.
