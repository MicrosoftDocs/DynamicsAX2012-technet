# Set up property groups 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can set up property groups and assign them to fixed assets. You then can track fixed assets according to the property classifications they are used for, such as trucks, cement mixers, and other types of construction equipment.

Property groups are often used together with other fixed asset codes, such as fixed asset groups, major types, and asset activity codes. For example, a public works department could have a fixed asset group of Vehicles, a major type of Trucks, an asset activity code of Construction, and property groups of Dump Truck and Cement Mixer.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>These codes are optional, and you can use them according to your business requirements to track additional information about fixed assets for your organization. Set up only the code types that fit your needs. You can use the codes together in any combination to track fixed assets in the <STRONG>Fixed assets</STRONG> form.</P>



1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Setup** \> **Property groups**.

2.  Click **New** to create a property group.

3.  Enter a unique property group code, such as CemMixer.

4.  Enter a description of the property group, such as Cement Mixer.

5.  Repeat steps 2 through 4 for each additional property group code.
