2.  In the **Functional area** list, select the functional area for which you want to reorder question groups.

3.  Click the **Functional area** button, and then click **Reorder question groups**.

4.  In the **Reorder question groups** form, select the name of a question group, and then click the **Up** or **Down** button to move it to a different position in the list.

5.  Repeat step 4 for each question group that you want to move.

6.  Click **Reorder**.
