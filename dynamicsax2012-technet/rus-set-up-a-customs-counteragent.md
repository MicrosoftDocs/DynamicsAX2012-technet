# (RUS) Set up a customs counteragent 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use the **Customs counteragents** form to set up a vendor account as a customs authority or a customs broker. You can also set up a customs office code and a posting profile that is used to calculate customs payments. This information is included in customs declarations that are submitted to the customs authority. The codes for the customs offices are defined in the Customs Code of the Russian Federation.

In the **Acquit method** field, you can specify an acquit method. The acquit method determines the entity that provides customs when the customs clearance is processed by the customs broker. When you create a customs journal, the available customs brokers are filtered based on the acquit method that you selected.
