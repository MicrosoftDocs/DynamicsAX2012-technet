# About reporting BOMs as finished 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When you report a bill of materials (BOM) that is not assigned to a production order as finished, the system creates a BOM journal with the item issues and an item receipt for the item.

You can continue to work in the journal before it is posted. At a minimum, you must specify the date when the BOM is reported as finished, the item number, existing configurations, the BOM number, and the quantity that is finished. The system populates some fields with information from the **Released products** table.
