# Mass deploy retail components 


Starting in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, tools are available to help you automate and centralize the deployment of the retail components of Microsoft Dynamics AX. These tools make it easier to install Microsoft Dynamics AX components on multiple computers in a retail environment.

You’ll start by entering topology and configuration information in Microsoft Dynamics AX. Then, you’ll use the command-line tool that is included with the Retail mass deployment toolkit to export the information. For information about how to install the toolkit, see [Install the Retail mass deployment toolkit](install-the-retail-mass-deployment-toolkit.md). You can use the exported environment information with a deployment tool to facilitate the deployment.

The following deployment options are available:

  - [Mass deploy Retail components by using System Center Configuration Manager](mass-deploy-retail-components-by-using-system-center-configuration-manager.md) Configuration Manager allows you to manage your environment from a console at headquarters. Therefore, you do not have to run Setup on each computer in the Retail implementation.

  - [Set up a self-service Retail deployment](set-up-a-self-service-retail-deployment.md) In a self-service deployment, the administrator plans and configures the deployment at headquarters, and then provides an installation package to users at the store.
