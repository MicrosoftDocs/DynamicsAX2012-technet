# (ITA) Reverse a conditional sales tax transaction and generate the sales tax payment report 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Conditional sales tax transactions are the sales tax transactions for which the sales tax is paid in proportion to the actual amount paid on the invoice. In accordance with the legislative requirement in Italy, you can reverse the conditional sales tax transactions for an open VAT period.

You can print the Sales tax payment report even if you have not posted invoices for the selected VAT period. The page numbers in the report are continuous even if there are no transactions for a period. The report includes blank pages for periods that have no transactions, and those pages are numbered. For example, if you generate a report for the period January 2011 to December 2011, and if you have no transactions for March, May, and November, the report will contain blank pages for those months.

However, you cannot post an invoice if the invoice posting date is earlier than the closing date shown in the **Close Italian sales tax book section** field in the **Italian sales tax book sections** form. The closing date is updated when the sales tax payment report is generated in the update mode. However, you can post or reverse an invoice if the VAT period is not closed.

To generate the sales tax payment report, you must complete the following tasks:

  - Set up a sales tax authority.

  - Set up the Italian sales tax book.

  - Set up the Italian sales tax regulations.

For more information, see [Set up conditional sales taxes](set-up-conditional-sales-taxes.md).
