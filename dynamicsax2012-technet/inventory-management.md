# Inventory management 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use Inventory management for inbound and outbound operations, quality assurance, warehouse activities, and inventory control.

From the **Arrival overview** form you can keep track of expected items and you can use arrival journals to register receipts. After items have arrived in the inbound dock, you can use pallet transports to guide the flow through the warehouse to the picking or the bulk location areas.

You can set up quality inspection and quarantine of products as an automated process by using quality associations or you can manually set products on hold in various stages of the order process cycle.

Process shipments for complete orders, parts of orders or a consolidation of multiple orders and create picking routes or pallet transports based on the contents of the shipment. You can use picking lists and output orders to ship items to production or to the distribution channels.
