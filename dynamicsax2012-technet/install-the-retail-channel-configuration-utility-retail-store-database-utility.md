Install the Retail Channel Configuration Utility on computers where you must create a channel database or configure a Retail POS connection to a channel database. A channel database may be created either on a stand-alone database server or on a POS computer.

This topic explains how to install the Retail Channel Configuration Utility by using the Setup wizard.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Retail components are available only with Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, AX 2012 R2, and AX 2012 Feature Pack. In AX 2012 R2 and AX 2012 Feature Pack, Retail Channel Configuration Utility was called Retail Store Database Utility.</P>



The Retail Channel Configuration Utility can be used to complete the following tasks:

  - Configure Retail POS and Offline Sync Service

  - Create a channel database

  - Create or re-provision an offline database

## Before you install the Retail Channel Configuration Utility

  - On the computer where you plan to install this component, run the prerequisite validation utility to verify that system requirements have been met. For information about how to run the prerequisite validation utility, see [Check prerequisites](check-prerequisites.md).
    
    For more information about the hardware and software requirements for Microsoft Dynamics AX, see the [system requirements](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=165377) .

  - Install [Microsoft Sync Framework hotfix 2703853](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2703853) on all computers on which you install Retail POS or Retail Modern POS.
    

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > <P>This hotfix can prevent potential data loss when synchronizing Retail offline databases with the channel database.</P>
