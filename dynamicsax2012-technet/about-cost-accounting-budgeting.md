# About cost accounting budgeting 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Budgeting is a forecasting feature that enables you to plan costs for the future. It extends the budgeting functionality of the general ledger, and makes it possible to transfer budget amounts from the general ledger.

The Cost accounting module has two separate forecast functions: budgeting, which is standard functionality, and flexible planning, which is an advanced budgeting functionality and requires special licensing.

If you want to plan costs, you must first create a budget model using one of the following budget model types:

  - **Cost accounting budget**

  - **Ledger budget**

  - **Flexible budgeting**

The **Budget overview** form provides an overview of all budget costs. To receive an overview of budget costs using all budget models, you can aggregate these budget models by linking them to each other as submodels on the **Submodel** tab of the **Budget model** form.

When you create budgets, you must distinguish between:

  - **Cost budget** – Used to create budgets based on cost categories.

  - **Service budget** – Used to create budgets based on service categories.
