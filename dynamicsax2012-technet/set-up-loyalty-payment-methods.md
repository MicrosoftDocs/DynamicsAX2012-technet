# Set up loyalty payment methods 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

This topic explains how to set up payment methods for loyalty schemes. You must set up a payment method before a loyalty card can be used at a register and loyalty points can be redeemed as part of a loyalty scheme. After you add the payment method to a store, or select it as a line rule on a loyalty scheme, customers can redeem their loyalty points.

To set up payment methods for loyalty schemes, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Payment methods** \> **Payment methods**.

2.  In the **Payment methods** form, click **New** to create a new payment method. Then enter the ID of the payment method, such as Loyalty, and the name.

3.  In the **Default function** column, select **Card**. This setting specifies that the point of sale (POS) system processes loyalty transactions as card transaction types.

4.  After you define loyalty cards as a payment method, you must set up the number sequences for the loyalty card numbers. For information about how to set up number sequences for loyalty cards, see [Set up card types and card numbers](set-up-card-types-and-card-numbers.md).
