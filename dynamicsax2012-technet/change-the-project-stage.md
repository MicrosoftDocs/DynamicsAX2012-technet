# Change the project stage 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Project stages can serve as a guide to the project life cycle. You can change the stage of a project to its next stage on the **Change project stage** page.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can define the project stages that you want to include in your projects by using the <STRONG>Project stage</STRONG> tab in the <STRONG>Project management and accounting parameters</STRONG> form in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client.</P>



1.  Click **Project management** on the top link bar, and then in the **Project name** column, click the project that you want to work with.

2.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Project** tab, in the **Maintain** group, click **Change stage**.

3.  On the **Change project stage** page, in the **Select new stage** field, select the next project stage.

4.  In the **Update subprojects** field, select whether to change only subprojects with the same type or all subprojects of the parent.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The <STRONG>Update subprojects</STRONG> field is available only if you have selected to change the status of a parent project.</P>



5.  Click **OK**.
