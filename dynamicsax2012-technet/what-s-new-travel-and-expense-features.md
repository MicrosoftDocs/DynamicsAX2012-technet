<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Tighter integration between Expense management and Projects</p></td>
<td><p>You can now filter by project, category, or employee validation, set up default dimensions, and budget for projects in Expense management. In addition, expense entry has been optimized for project expenses.</p>

<tr class="even">
<td><p>Expense report posting can be added to workflow.</p></td>
<td><p>You can now post expense reports as part of the expense report workflow.</p>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Expense budget control</p></td>
<td><p>You can now have better control over budgets by monitoring and controlling actual spending.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="set-up-budget-control.md">Set up budget control</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Receipt management by using expense reports</p></td>
<td><p>Because business organizations are not required to pay taxes on legitimate business travel and entertainment expenses in some countries/regions, a legitimate record must be created and submitted to the appropriate tax authorities. Receipt management lets users provide transaction receipt records together with an expense report that is submitted.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="key-tasks-create-expense-reports.md">Key tasks: Create expense reports</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Enhanced Level-3 data on expense reports</p></td>
<td><p>You can more closely control and monitor the company money that is spent by employees. Level-3 data requires that employees provide more information about the expenses that they incur when they travel for work. This information can show when policies are violated and when employees are overcharged.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="about-travel-and-expense-policies.md">About travel and expense policies</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Recovery of value-added tax (VAT)</p></td>
<td><p>VAT can be recovered from certain expenses that are incurred in specific countries/regions. In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, you could calculate and recover some taxes by using the sales tax code configuration. You can now calculate VAT and potentially recover even more money.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="value-added-tax-vat-recovery-in-travel-and-expense.md">Value Added Tax (VAT) recovery in Travel and expense</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Define travel and expense policies.</p></td>
<td><p>By using Level-2 and Level-3 data, you can create more detailed policies for travel and expenses. You can also create more detailed pre-travel policies.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="about-travel-and-expense-policies.md">About travel and expense policies</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>The expense report workflow is now integrated into workflow.</p></td>
<td><p>The Expense management workflow that is based on line-level reviews of expense reports has been integrated with the workflow framework. This integration enables more efficient customization.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="set-up-workflows-for-travel-and-expense.md">Set up workflows for travel and expense</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Credit card disputes on expense reports</p></td>
<td><p>If a credit card transaction on an expense report has inaccurate information, you can create and submit a transaction dispute when you reconcile the expense report. However, a transaction dispute can be submitted only to the credit card company, not to the merchant where the transaction occurred.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="key-tasks-credit-card-expense-disputes.md">Key tasks: Credit card expense disputes</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Expense management workflows</p></td>
<td><p>You can create work item queues for Expense management workflows. Expense reports can be routed to a queue of users, and a user in that queue can complete tasks for the expense report. For example, the user can verify that receipts have been attached.</p>
