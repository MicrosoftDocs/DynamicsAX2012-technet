# (IND) Post purchase transactions of excise using the Invoice approval journal form 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

When you fetch a voucher from the invoice register journal and post it in the invoice approval journal, the taxes posted in the invoice register journal are reversed. When you credit the vendor account and debit the ledger account, the excise amounts calculated will be debited to the accounts as defined in the tax ledger posting group for the ECC number.

The excise register Part II is updated with the excise amount according to the type of register that you select in the **Excise record type** field on the **Tax information** tab in the **Invoice approval journal** form.

The ledger accounts that will be debited with the excise amounts will depend on the excise record type that you select in the **Excise record type** field.
