# View retail sales (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to view a list of sales transactions by store based on the date range, time range, retail hierarchy, and item number that you specify in the **Retail sales** form.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Retail essentials, the form that you use to complete this task includes a subset of the controls that are available for other configurations of Retail. If a topic about this form describes controls that you don't see, it may be because you’re using Retail essentials.</P>



To view sales transactions, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Retail essentials** \> **Financials** \> **Retail sales**.

2.  To view a specific set of transactions, specify a value for all or some of the parameters. You can also select whether to view only posted transactions or open transactions.

3.  To view the inventory transactions that pertain to a line, select an item, and then click **Transactions**.

4.  To view the on-hand availability of an item, select an item, and then click **On-hand**.

5.  To view the transactions for an inventory lot, select an item, and then click **Lot**. Lots are generated when you create orders that produce a receipt or an issue in inventory.
