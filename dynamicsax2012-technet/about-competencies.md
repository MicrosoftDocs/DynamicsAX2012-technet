  - Education

  - Skills

  - Professional experience

  - Courses

  - Certificates

  - Project experience

  - Positions of trust

  - Tests

  - Contact interests

## Education

You can track education information for workers, applicants, and contact persons. You must maintain a list of education disciplines, institutions, and degrees before you can associate education information to a worker or applicant. Use the following forms to set up this information:

  - [Education disciplines (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa589077\(v=ax.60\))

  - [Education discipline category (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa557412\(v=ax.60\))

  - [Degrees (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa571288\(v=ax.60\))

## Skills

You can maintain a list of skills for workers, applicants, and contact persons. A skill can be either an actual skill that the person currently has acquired or a target skill that the person plans to acquire. When you use skill mapping to search for a person in your organization who has a particular qualification, you can search for skills. For more information, see [About skills](about-skills.md).

## Professional experience

You can maintain information about where a worker, applicant, and contact person was previous employed, and you can enter information about their job responsibilities for their previous employer. See [Professional experience (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa550286\(v=ax.60\)).

## Courses

You can enter information about the courses that a worker, applicant, or contact person has completed. Internal courses are the courses that your company provides for your workers. Before you can track a worker’s completion of internal courses, you must first set up courses. For more information, see [Setting up training course information](setting-up-training-course-information.md).

## Certificates

You can maintain a list of certificates that a worker, applicant, or contact person has achieved. Before you can enter certificate information for a person, you must set up certificate types. For more information, see [Certificate types (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa619900\(v=ax.60\)).

## Project experience

You can maintain information about projects that a worker, applicant, or contact person has been involved in. For more information, see [Project experience (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa575899\(v=ax.60\)).

## Positions of trust

You can maintain information about any position or role that a worker, applicant, or contact person performs outside the responsibilities of their primary position. For example, a position of trust can be membership in a professional association or a seat on a board of directors. This information can be included in a skill mapping search. For more information, see [Position of trust (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa591442\(v=ax.60\)).

## Tests

You can set up one-time tests, or tests that occur regularly and track a worker’s or applicant’s completion of the tests. An example might be a technical test that an applicant must pass before they can begin a new job, or a job-related test that a worker must pass every year to maintain their employment. Before you can enter information about tests for workers or applicants, you must set up test types. For more information, see [Test types (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj677419\(v=ax.60\)).

## Contact interests

You can enter information about a contact person’s professional or personal interests. Tracking this information can be helpful to maintain consistent personal contact and correspondence with the contact person. Before you can enter information about a contact person’s interests, you must first set up interests. For more information, see [Interest (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa577265\(v=ax.60\)) or [Contact interests (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa554489\(v=ax.60\)).
