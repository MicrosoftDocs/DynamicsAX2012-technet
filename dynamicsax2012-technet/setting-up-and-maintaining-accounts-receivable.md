# Setting up and maintaining Accounts receivable 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use Accounts receivable to track all invoices and incoming payments from customers.

You can set up customer groups, customers, posting profiles, various payment options, interest notes, collection letters, commissions, parameters regarding customers, charges, deliveries and destinations, bills of exchange, and other types of Accounts receivable information.

Depending on your setup, you can then perform many tasks that are related to customers and sales, such as creating and managing free text invoices and settling customer invoices.

The topics in this section provide information about setting up and maintaining Accounts receivable.
