Use this procedure to create and maintain restricted product regional lists for states and provinces.

1.  In the **Country/region** field, select the country and region (if applicable) for which the list is being created.

2.  In the **State/Province** field, select the state and province (if applicable) in the selected country/region.

3.  In the **List ID** field, enter a unique identification for this list.

4.  In the **Restriction list** type field, select whether the list is **Inclusive** or **Exclusive** for this country/region. The list types are as follows:
    
      - **Inclusive** – Products distributed under the list are not restricted and can be sold in this country/region. You can select this list type only at the country/region level.
    
      - **Exclusive**– Products distributed under the list are restricted and cannot be sold in any country/region, state, or province in which the list is valid. You can select this list type at the country/region, state, or province level.

5.  To create a list for another state or province, press CTRL+N to add a new line. Then repeat steps 2 through 5.
