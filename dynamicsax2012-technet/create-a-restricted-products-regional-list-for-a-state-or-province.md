_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use this procedure to create and maintain restricted product regional lists for states and provinces.

1.  In the **Country/region** field, select the country and region (if applicable) for which the list is being created.

2.  In the **State/Province** field, select the state and province (if applicable) in the selected country.

3.  In the **List ID** field, enter a unique identification for this list.

4.  In the **Restriction list** type field, select whether the list is **Inclusive** or **Exclusive** for this country. The list types are as follows:
    
      - **Inclusive** – Products distributed under the list are not restricted and can be sold in this country. You can select this list type only at the country level.
    
      - **Exclusive**– Products distributed under the list are restricted and cannot be sold in any country, state, or province in which the list is valid. You can select this list type at the country, state, or province level.

5.  To create a list for another state or province, press CTRL+N to add a new line. Then repeat steps 2 through 5.
