# (BRA) Create and post a purchase order 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can create and post a purchase order by specifying the operation type, presence type of the fiscal operation, and Código Fiscal de Operações e Prestações (CFOP) code. The presence type of a fiscal operation in a purchase order is used to record fiscal information for receipts, packing slips, and invoices during posting.

You must assign a fiscal establishment to a site before you can create and post a purchase order. For more information, see [(BRA) Create sites](bra-create-sites.md).

Use the following procedures to create and post a purchase order.

## Create a purchase order

Use the **Create purchase order** form to create a purchase order.

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Common** \> **Purchase orders** \> **All purchase orders**.

2.  On the **Action Pane**, click **Purchase order**, and then in the **Vendor account** field, select a vendor account.

3.  On the **General** FastTab, in the **Purchase type** field, select **Purchase order**.

4.  Click **OK**.

5.  In the **Purchase order** form, on the **Action Pane**, click **Header view**, and then click the **Fiscal information** FastTab.

6.  In the **Operation type** field, select the operation type for the purchase order that determines whether the vendor invoice generates accounting entries or inventory movement, or creates vendor transactions.

7.  In the **Presence type** field, modify the presence type of the fiscal operation that you specified for the vendor on the **Fiscal information** FastTab in the **Vendor** form, if required. If you create a new purchase order for a vendor by copying an existing purchase order, the presence type of the original purchase order is applied to the new copied purchase order.
