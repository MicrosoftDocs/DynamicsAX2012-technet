# Document management in sales and marketing 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use the document management system in the **Sales and marketing** section for several tasks. You can attach documents to prospects, contact persons, and sales quotations. You can also attach internal notes to activities and tasks. Additionally, in both the **Sales and marketing** and **Project management and accounting** sections, you can create a standard quotation template. You use this template when you issue quotations and merge information within a quotation.

The document management system in the **Sales and marketing** section is built on the standard document management system for Microsoft Dynamics AX. However, it has more visualizations, and it can be opened from the following forms in **Sales and marketing**:

  - **Prospects**

  - **Contacts**

  - **Sales quotation**

  - **Telemarketing**

  - **Campaigns**

When you attach a document to a record in a form, the empty document icon on the record line changes to a book icon. The book icon indicates that a document is attached to the active record. The document can be a file of any type that is set up in the **Document types** form. Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Document management** \> **Document types**.

You can filter the documents in the **Documents** form by worker or date of creation. To display all the documents that have been created for the active record (prospect, contact, activity, campaign, and so on), select the **Show all** check box.

The document management system in the **Sales and marketing** section uses the setup procedures and settings from the standard document management system. However, it also includes some unique settings.

The following topics provide information about document management.
