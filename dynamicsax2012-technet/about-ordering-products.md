  - Search the procurement catalog for items and services by category or keyword.

  - View details about a selected item or service and add it to your shopping cart.

  - Create an order, by category or vendor, for items that are not in a catalog.

  - Access the vendor’s catalog, if your organization allows you to order products directly from the vendor.

  - Verify the contents of your shopping cart, check out, and create and submit a purchase requisition for the items and services that you selected.

  - View open and completed orders.

  - Confirm orders that you have received.
