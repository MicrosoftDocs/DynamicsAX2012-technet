Before you can create and post a purchase order for a potency item, you must complete the following tasks:

1.  Assign batch attributes to a potency item. For more information, see [Assign batch attributes to a potency item](assign-batch-attributes-to-a-potency-item.md).

2.  Add batch attribute values to an inventory batch for potency items. For more information, see [Add batch attribute values to an inventory batch for potency items](add-batch-attribute-values-to-an-inventory-batch-for-potency-items.md).

3.  Set up an attribute-based pricing formula for a potency item. For more information, see [Set up an attribute-based pricing formula for a potency item](set-up-an-attribute-based-pricing-formula-for-a-potency-item.md).

4.  Create a purchase trade agreement and add attribute-based pricing details to it.
