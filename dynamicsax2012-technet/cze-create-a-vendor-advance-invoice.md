# (CZE) Create a vendor advance invoice 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

An advance invoice is a document that you can create for a vendor. The advance invoice shows the amount that must be prepaid on a purchase order. The prepayment must be made before the order is processed. The advance invoice is not an accounting document or a tax document, but is used only as the basis for prepayments.

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Common** \> **Advance invoices** \> **All advance invoices**. To create a new advance invoice, click **Advance invoice**. To open an existing advance invoice, double-click the advance invoice.

2.  Enter the required information, and then click **Post** to post the invoice.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, in the **Actions** group, click **Status** to open the **Change the status of an advance invoice** form. In the **New status** field, select the status for the advance invoice.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can change the status of the advance invoice at any time. However, you cannot process advance invoices in transactions if the advance invoices have been closed.</P>



4.  Press CTRL+S, or close the form.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can also create a vendor advance invoice by using the <STRONG>Purchase order</STRONG> form. Select an existing purchase order, or create a new purchase order. On the <STRONG>Action Pane</STRONG>, on the <STRONG>Invoice</STRONG> tab, in the <STRONG>Generate</STRONG> group, click <STRONG>Advance invoice</STRONG>. Then follow steps 2 through 4 of the previous procedure.</P>
