# Install Connector for Microsoft Dynamics 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

This topic describes how to install Connector for Microsoft Dynamics by using the Microsoft Dynamics AX Setup wizard. Use Connector to integrate data between Microsoft Dynamics CRM and Microsoft Dynamics AX. For example, you can integrate Microsoft Dynamics AX customers with Microsoft Dynamics CRM accounts. This integration gives you access to up-to-date customer and account information in both systems. For more information about Connector, see [the Connector page](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=324872) on CustomerSource (logon is required).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Connector is available through the Microsoft Dynamics AX Setup wizard in cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 (CU 7) and AX 2012 R3. For information about how to install Connector with CU 7, see the <A href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=329982">Installation Guide for cumulative update 7</A>.</P>
> <P>If you’re not using Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 or cumulative update 7 or later for AX 2012 R2, you can use the stand-alone installation for Connector. Download and run the .msi file that is available on CustomerSource. For information about how to run the stand-alone installation, see <A href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=325397">Installation Guide</A> (PDF) for Connector.</P>



You must install Connector on a computer where Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Object Server (AOS), the Microsoft Dynamics AX client, and .NET Business Connector are installed. If these components have not been installed, they will be selected automatically in Setup when you install Connector.

## Before you install Connector for Microsoft Dynamics

  - Create or select the user accounts that will be used to run the Connector service and to integrate data between Microsoft Dynamics AX and Microsoft Dynamics CRM. For more information about the requirements for these accounts, see [Create service accounts](create-service-accounts.md).

  - On the computer where you plan to install this component, run the prerequisite validation utility to verify that system requirements have been met. For information about how to run the prerequisite validation utility, see [Check prerequisites](check-prerequisites.md).
    
    For more information about the hardware and software requirements for Microsoft Dynamics AX, see the [system requirements](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=165377).
