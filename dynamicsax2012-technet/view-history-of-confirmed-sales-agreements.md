# View history of confirmed sales agreements 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When a sales agreement is confirmed, the current version of the sales agreement is stored in a history table and assigned a version number. The confirmation history of a sales agreement contains information about the customer, line details from the sales agreement, and the terms of the sales agreement.

If a sales agreement is changed, you must confirm the sales agreement. After you confirm the sales agreement, the changes become active, and the new version appears in the history. In this manner, you can track the changes that have been made to a sales agreement.

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Common** \> **Sales orders** \> **Sales agreements**.

2.  Select the sales agreement to view the history for.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, click **Sales agreement confirmations**.

4.  In the **Sales agreement confirmations** form, in the left pane, select the version of the sales agreement confirmation to view.

5.  Click the **General** FastTab to view information from the sales agreement header. You can use the other FastTabs to view additional details about the sales agreement:
    
      - Click the **Lines** FastTab to view details about the sales agreement lines.
    
      - Click the **Delivery address** FastTab to view delivery information.
    
      - Click the **Terms** FastTab to view information about the terms of the sales agreement.
