# Print management 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use print management to manage the content of source documents, and generate and deliver them in a consistent way. You can use print management to print one original and many copies of a document that is produced as part of the posting process. This is like using preprinted, multiple-part forms in manual accounting systems.

You use footer text to distinguish the original from the copies. For example, for a sales order packing slip, you can set up footer text to print "Original" at the bottom of the original, "Customer copy" at the bottom of the first copy, and "Warehouse copy" at the bottom of the second copy. The documents that have print management capabilities and that are generated as part of the posting process include quotations, sales orders, free text invoices, project invoices, and purchase orders. For ease of maintenance, you can configure print management for all documents at the module level. To help you manage exception situations, you can also configure print management for specific accounts or transactions, as the business needs require.
