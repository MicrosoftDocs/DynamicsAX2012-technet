# Developing with Table Inheritance (White paper) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 introduces programming support for table inheritance, which lets developers specify fields that are common to all tables in a base table and to configure derived tables to inherit these fields. This paper outlines the developer experience of creating and programming a table inheritance hierarchy and describes the run-time behavior of various existing and new Microsoft Dynamics AX structures and processes that are involved with table inheritance.
