<td><p>Replaced by another feature</p></td>
<td><p>This feature is no longer available in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. Instead, AX 2012 supports ad-hoc reporting by using OLAP cubes. Business users can also take advantage of the capabilities of Microsoft Excel PowerPivot to generate ad-hoc business reports.</p>
