_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Beginning October 1, 2015, RapidStart services will no longer be supported.

As the Customer administrator for a Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services project, you can load the configuration data that is collected in the project to your implementation of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. Before you can load the data, the following prerequisites must be met:

  - The Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Connector must be installed on Microsoft Dynamics AX. For more information, see [Install the Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Connector for RapidStart Services](install-the-microsoft-dynamics-erp-rapidstart-connector-for-rapidstart-services.md).

  - The implementation of Microsoft Dynamics AX that you want to load configuration data into must be registered as an endpoint in your RapidStart Services account. For more information, see [Register a Microsoft Dynamics ERP endpoint in RapidStart Services](register-a-microsoft-dynamics-erp-endpoint-in-rapidstart-services.md).

  - All the questions that are included in the configuration project must be answered.
