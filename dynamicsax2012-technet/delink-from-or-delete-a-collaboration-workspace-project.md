# Delink from or delete a collaboration workspace (Project) 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When a project no longer requires a collaboration workspace, you can either remove its association with the workspace or delete the collaboration workspace entirely.

If you attempt to delete a collaboration workspace that is associated with other projects, campaigns, or opportunities, Microsoft Dynamics AX delinks the workspace from the business area that you are working on, but the workspace is not deleted.

### Delink a collaboration workspace from a project

1.  Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Common** \> **Projects** \> **All projects**. Select or open the project that you want to delink from its collaboration workspace.

2.  In the **Action Pane**, on the **Project** tab, in the **Set up** group, click **Collaboration workspace**, and then select **Delink collaboration workspace**.

### Delete a collaboration workspace from a project
