[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Receivable value-added tax (VAT) amounts can be refunded only if they are settled before the VAT reporting date. When your organization makes a sale, the recorded settlement date is the same as the invoice date. When a purchase made by your organization is settled, or paid in full, the recorded settlement date is the same as the invoice date. The settlement date is used when restricting records on the VAT Declaration report.

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **General ledger parameters**.

2.  In the left pane, click **Sales tax**, and then on the **Tax options** FastTab, in the **Special report** field group, select the **Date of VAT register** check box.
