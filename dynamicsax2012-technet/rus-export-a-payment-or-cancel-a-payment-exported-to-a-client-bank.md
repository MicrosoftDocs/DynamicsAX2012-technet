# (RUS) Export a payment or cancel a payment exported to a client bank 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can use electronic exchange formats to export payments to a client bank, and to import payments and bank account statements from a client bank. Payments include outgoing and incoming payments between Microsoft Dynamics AX and a client bank. For more information about the client bank process, see [(RUS) About the electronic exchange format for client bank payments](rus-about-the-electronic-exchange-format-for-client-bank-payments.md). Use the **Export of payments to client-bank** form to export a payment to a client bank. You can export transactions that are created in the payment journals to the client bank. You can also cancel a payment that is exported to a client bank by using the **Exported payments** form.

## Export a payment to a client bank

1.  Click **Cash and bank management** \> **Periodic** \> **Client-bank** \> **Export of payments to client-bank**.

2.  Select a journal line. Click **Journal line** to open the **Journal voucher** form, and then modify the journal line, if required.

3.  Close the form.
