# Create on-account invoices for all projects 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can create an on-account invoice as a progress billing that is unrelated to specific costs on Time and material projects. You can also create on-account invoices for a specified percentage of Fixed-price contract amounts.

1.  **Project management and accounting** \> **Periodic** \> **Invoice** \> **Create on-account**.

2.  Select the invoicing method that you want to use.

3.  Enter dates in the **From date**, **To date**, and **Invoice date** fields.

4.  Click **Select**, and then in the lower pane of the form, select the project contracts or projects for which you want to create on-account invoices.

5.  Click **OK**.
    
    On-account invoice proposals are now available in the **Invoice proposal** form.


> [!TIP]
> <P>When you open the <STRONG>Create on-account invoice proposals</STRONG> form from the <STRONG>Periodic</STRONG> group, on-account invoice proposals are created for all projects, unless you specify otherwise in the query.</P>
