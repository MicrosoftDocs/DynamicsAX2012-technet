# About registrations in electronic timecards [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Workers can use the **Electronic timecard** form to register their work time. The electronic timecard is typically used by workers with job tasks that do not require immediate feedback, for example, project activities.

Click **Home** \> **Common** \> **Time and attendance** \> **Electronic timecard**.

The following list contains examples of how to use the form:

  - A worker clocks in when arriving at work but does not register activities during the day. When the work day is over, the worker creates registrations for the whole day and clocks out.

  - A worker creates several registrations at one time, for example, once a week. The time consumption on different jobs is registered for each day in the period.

  - A worker has job tasks that require many work hours outside the company, for example, a sales consultant, or a service technician. The worker makes registrations on job tasks when he or she is in the office.

You must set up the following parameters before a worker can access the electronic timecard:

1.  Create the worker as a time registration worker.

2.  In the **Workers** details form, on the **Time registration** FastTab, select the **Use timecard** check box.

The following information is required to register time consumption on the electronic timecard:

  - Date

  - Registration type

  - Job reference - project, production order, or indirect activity

  - Job identification

  - Time consumption


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Buttons are available for posting project fees, such as, mileage, or for project items, such as item consumption, directly from the <STRONG>Electronic timecard</STRONG> form.</P>




> [!NOTE]
> <P>Before workers start to use the electronic timecard, make sure that the appropriate parameters are set up in the <STRONG>Display options</STRONG> area on the <STRONG>Time and attendance parameters</STRONG> form. Click <STRONG>Human resources</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Setup</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Time and attendance</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Time and attendance parameters</STRONG>.</P>
