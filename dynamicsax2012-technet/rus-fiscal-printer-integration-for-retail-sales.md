## What document types do fiscal printers support?

Fiscal printers support the printing of fiscal receipts for documents that are related to retail POS. You can print fiscal receipts for retail sales, item returns, starting amounts, float entries, tender removals, X-reports, and Z-reports.

## Can I register a retail sale with multiple payments using varied payment methods?

Yes. You can add items to a sales transaction at the POS and register partial payments for the sales. You can use multiple payment methods to make the partial payments. The fiscal receipt is printed for the closing transaction after the final payment for the sales transaction is completed.

## Can I configure multiple fiscal receipt layouts for POS document types?

Yes. You can configure multiple layouts for various POS document types. A document type can have only one layout. The printer configuration file may contain additional settings for all document types to use multiple fiscal receipt layouts. If additional printer settings are not specified in the printer configuration file, the default layout is used to print a fiscal receipt.

## Does the integrated fiscal printer support tax calculations?

Yes. Fiscal printers calculate taxes, and print them on a fiscal receipt. The tax transaction details are transferred to retail POS and Microsoft Dynamics AX after the calculation of taxes.

## Can I print retail discounts on a fiscal receipt?

Yes. Retail discounts can be printed on a fiscal receipt based on the layout that is configured for the receipt. You can print discounts on sales receipt lines, return receipts, and receipt totals.

## Can I print a fiscal receipt for a customer order or a customer account deposit that is paid in POS?

No. You cannot print a fiscal receipt for a customer order or a customer deposit transaction.
