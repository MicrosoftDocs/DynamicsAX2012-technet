# Create a purchase order for items that have an environmental impact 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When you create a purchase order that meets the criteria enabled in the **Environmental parameters** form, you must enter information on the **Environment** tab in the **Purchase order** form before you can post the purchase order.

This topic describes the information that must be entered on the **Environment** tab. For more information about purchase orders, see [Create a purchase order](create-a-purchase-order.md).

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Common** \> **Purchase orders** \> **All purchase orders**.

2.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Purchase order** tab, in the **New** group, click **Purchase order**.

3.  Enter the purchase order information. For more information about how to create a purchase order, see [Create a purchase order](create-a-purchase-order.md).
    
    When you add an item that has been identified as a substance in **Compliance and internal controls**, the **Environment** tab is displayed on the **Line details** FastTab.

4.  On the **Line details** FastTab, on the **Environment** tab, click **Add** to create a new line.
    
    Some fields contain default information that is based on settings that link processes to vendors or link substance flows between two processes.

5.  Select the source process that is assigned to the substance and the substance flow.
    
    For more information about source processes and substance flow, see [Set up substance flows between processes](set-up-substance-flows-between-processes.md).
