## Create and post a credit note for a cash discount

You can create a credit note for a cash discount that you posted for a sales order, a free text invoice, or a project invoice. For more information about how to post a cash discount, see [Scenario: Cash discount handling for overpayments](scenario-cash-discount-handling-for-overpayments.md).

You can use the **Payment journal** and **Journal voucher** forms to create and post a payment for the invoice that you posted for a cash discount. When you post the payment journal, the payment is posted, the cash discount is reversed, and AX 2012 R2 creates a credit note automatically. You can print the credit note from the **Invoice journal** form. For more information, see [Enter and settle customer payments in a payment journal](enter-and-settle-customer-payments-in-a-payment-journal.md), [Journal header (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa557917\(v=ax.60\)), [Journal voucher - Customer payment journal (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa556141\(v=ax.60\)), and [(CZE) Customer invoice journal (modified form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj677569\(v=ax.60\)).
