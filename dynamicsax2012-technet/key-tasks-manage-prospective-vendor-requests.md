# Key tasks: Manage prospective vendor requests 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

As a vendor request reviewer, you process requests that employees submit to add new vendors to the list of approved vendors for their legal entity. If you approve a request, the vendor becomes a prospective vendor. Your system administrator adds the contact for the prospective vendor to the list of external Microsoft Dynamics AX users and grants the contact access to the **Vendor registration** page in Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX. A notification is sent to the vendor, and the vendor must complete the application and submit it for approval.

**Prerequisites**

  - Your system administrator must set up the workflow tasks for the vendor request process. For more information about the workflow tasks, see [Setting up and maintaining procurement and sourcing workflows](setting-up-and-maintaining-procurement-and-sourcing-workflows.md).

  - If you are using flexible authentication to provide vendor users access to Enterprise Portal and, ultimately, the Vendor portal, your system administrator must set up the user provisioning process. For more information, see [Key tasks: Set up vendor user provisioning](key-tasks-set-up-vendor-user-provisioning.md).

  - Your system administrator must configure the Enterprise Portal pages for prospective vendors, vendors, and employees. For more information, see [About vendor request configuration](about-vendor-request-configuration.md).

    A warning contains information about a possible conflict of interest or other issue in a vendor profile. For example, a vendor name may have a matching record in the employee database or a vendor may be located in an embargoed country or region.

4.  In the **Prospective vendor profile** form, review the information on the **General**, **Payment information**, and **Questionnaire information** FastTabs, according to the purchasing policies of your organization.

5.  To approve the prospective vendor, on the **General** FastTab, in the **Vendor group** field, select a vendor group. This information is required before you can submit the approval to workflow.

6.  In the workflow message bar, click **Actions** \> **Approve**.

7.  In the **Vendor add application workflow** form, enter an optional comment, and then click **Approve** to submit the approval to workflow.

A notification is sent to the employee who requested the vendor to indicate that the vendor has been approved. If your system administrator has configured workflow to send a notification to the vendor, the vendor contact receives an e-mail message that informs them of the approval.
