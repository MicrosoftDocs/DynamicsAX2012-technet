_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can assign specific number sequences to invoices and packing slips that are generated in the **Accounts receivable**, **Accounts payable**, **Inventory management**, and **Project** modules. You also can specify individual number sequences for different users and user groups, customer and vendor groups, or warehouses. The sequence numbers are printed on the **Invoice register** and the **Packing slip registration journal** reports.

You can also number invoices and packing slips manually. When you enter document numbers manually, you can turn on number verification for invoices and packing slips in **Accounts receivable** to ensure that the numbers are unique. To use number sequences for invoices and packing slips, you must select the **Invoice** and the **Packing slip numbering** by user or user groups. You must specify the module, customer or vendor group, and document type for which the number sequences will be used.

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Common** \> **Number sequences** \> **Registers** \> **Counters management**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a new record.

3.  In the **Module** field, select the module.

4.  In the **Account code** field, select **Group** or **All** as the account code.

    > [!NOTE]

6.  In the **Type** field, select either **Invoice** or **Packing slip**.
