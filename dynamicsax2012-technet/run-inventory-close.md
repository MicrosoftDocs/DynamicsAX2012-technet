# Run inventory close 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

After you complete the recommended steps in the topic [Preparing to run inventory close](preparing-to-run-inventory-close.md), run the close procedure by completing the following steps:

1.  Click **Inventory management** \> **Periodic** \> **Closing and adjustment**. Click **Close procedure** \> **3. Close**.

2.  In the **Close inventory up to** field, enter the end date for which you want to close inventory.

3.  If you want to run a recalculation up to the current date after the closing has been completed, select the **Run recalculation after closing** check box.

4.  Configure any other options that you want to set for this inventory close.

5.  Click **OK**.

After the inventory close has been completed, the results are reported in the **Closing and adjustment** form.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>To speed up subsequent inventory close procedures, avoid running too many recalculations after the expected closing date.</P>
