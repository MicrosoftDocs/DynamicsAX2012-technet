# Key tasks: Prepayments 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

With a prepayment invoice, you can make advance invoice payments to a vendor before the purchase order is fulfilled. For example, a vendor might require a prepayment for specific goods or services. After the prepayment is paid, your legal entity can later apply the prepayment to one or more vendor invoices to offset the amount that was already paid.
