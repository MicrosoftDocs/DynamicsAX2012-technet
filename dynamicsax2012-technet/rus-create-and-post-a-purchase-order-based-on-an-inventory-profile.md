# (RUS) Create and post a purchase order based on an inventory profile 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use the **Purchase order** form to post the packing slip, invoice, and facture for a purchase order. The inventory profile on the purchase order line must belong to the kind of activity that is selected in the purchase order, unless the kind of activity is **Unspecified**. The posting profile on the purchase order line is defined in the **Inventory profile - posting profile** form. Therefore, if the inventory profile is selected, the corresponding posting profile is selected automatically.

You can also post purchase indirect costs for purchase order lines that have an inventory profile with **Basic** as the kind of activity.
