# Set up a retail store (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to set up a retail store. In Retail essentials, a retail (brick-and-mortar) store is considered a type of warehouse. In the following procedure, you first create a warehouse and define it as a store. You then create a new store and assign the warehouse to it.

After you set up a store, you must add it to an organization hierarchy that is assigned to a purpose. For example, the organization hierarchy can be used for assortments, replenishment, or reporting. For more information, see [Working with organizations and organizational hierarchies (Retail essentials)](working-with-organizations-and-organizational-hierarchies-retail-essentials.md)

To set up a store in Retail essentials, follow these steps:
