# Set up total compensation statement sections 


This topic explains how to set up a total compensation statement. A total compensation statement is comprised of sections which contain compensation elements such as benefits, tax codes, and earning codes. To set up a total compensation statement, first create at least one total compensation statement section. Then add the compensation elements that you want to include on the statement into the sections. You can use the total compensation statement sections to organize the compensation elements into logical groups. Totals for each section will be included in the total compensation statement.

You can add any combination of compensation elements to each total compensation statement section. The three types of compensation elements that can be added to a total compensation statement section are:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Compensation type</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Benefits</p></td>
<td><p>You can select any of the benefits that are set up in the system.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Earnings</p></td>
<td><p>You can select any of the earnings codes and earnings groups that are set up in the system. Any earning codes with a Pay statement line source equal to “Fringe benefit recovery” will not be included in the total compensation statement.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Taxes</p></td>
<td><p>You can select any of the tax codes and any of the tax groups that are set up in the system.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


While it is more likely that you’ll use this functionality to create total compensation statements, you could also create benefit statements or tax statements using this functionality.
