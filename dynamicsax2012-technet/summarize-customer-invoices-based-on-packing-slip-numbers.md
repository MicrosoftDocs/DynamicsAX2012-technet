# Summarize customer invoices based on packing slip numbers 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use this procedure to create customer invoices that correspond to packing slip numbers. Each invoice can include line items from multiple sales orders, provided that the line items are included on the same packing slip. You can then invoice customers for each delivery, regardless of when the items were ordered.

## Example

You use the **Summary update for** field in the sales order **Posting invoice** form to summarize the customer invoices. You have three sales orders and three packing slips, as shown in the following table. All packing slips have the same invoice account and currency code.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Packing slip 1: June 15</p></th>
<th><p>Packing slip 2: June 17</p></th>
<th><p>Packing slip 3: June 19</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Sales order 1, line 1</p></td>
<td><p>Sales order 2, line 2</p></td>
<td><p>Sales order 3, line 2</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Sales order 1, line 2</p></td>
<td><p>Sales order 2, line 3</p></td>
<td><p>Sales order 3, line 3</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Sales order 2, line 1</p></td>
<td><p>Sales order 3, line 1</p></td>
<td><p>Sales order 1, line 3</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


If you select **Packing slip** in the **Summary update for** field, the invoices are summarized as shown in the following table.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Invoice 1: June 30</p></th>
<th><p>Invoice 2: June 30</p></th>
<th><p>Invoice 3: June 30</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Sales order 1, line 1</p></td>
<td><p>Sales order 2, line 2</p></td>
<td><p>Sales order 3, line 2</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Sales order 1, line 2</p></td>
<td><p>Sales order 2, line 3</p></td>
<td><p>Sales order 3, line 3</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Sales order 2, line 1</p></td>
<td><p>Sales order 3, line 1</p></td>
<td><p>Sales order 1, line 3</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


If you select **None** in the **Summary update for** field to indicate that you do not want to summarize the invoices, the invoices are based on the sales order documents, as shown in the following table.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Invoice 1: June 30</p></th>
<th><p>Invoice 2: June 30</p></th>
<th><p>Invoice 3: June 30</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Sales order 1, line 1</p></td>
<td><p>Sales order 2, line 1</p></td>
<td><p>Sales order 3, line 1</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Sales order 1, line 2</p></td>
<td><p>Sales order 2, line 2</p></td>
<td><p>Sales order 3, line 2</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Sales order 1, line 3</p></td>
<td><p>Sales order 2, line 3</p></td>
<td><p>Sales order 3, line 3</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
