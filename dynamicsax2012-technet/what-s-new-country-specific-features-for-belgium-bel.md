As of January 1, 2015, the procedure for submitting Intrastat returns to the National Bank of Belgium (NBB) has changed. Intrastat returns can now be submitted only by using OneGate. This online program enables you to enter the data manually or to import data files in CSV or XML format. The changes are applicable for all Belgian companies and allow you to create Intrastat reports in XML format.
