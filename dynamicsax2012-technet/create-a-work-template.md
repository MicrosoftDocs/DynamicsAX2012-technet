# Create a work template 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic applies to features in the <STRONG>Warehouse management</STRONG> module. It does not apply to features in the <A href="inventory-management.md">Inventory management</A> module.</P>



A work template is used to create and process warehouse work at various stages in the warehouse management process. A valid work template should be specified in pairs of pick and put. You can create a work template for the following types of warehouse-related activities:

  - Inbound transactions.

  - Picking of inventory items.

  - Production tasks such as picking or putting of raw materials.

  - Inventory transfers.

  - Movement of inventory items between locations.

  - Replenishment of locations.

When you create a work template, you can specify a location directive code. If you specify a location directive code, Microsoft Dynamics AX validates the location directive to find and use a location. If a work template is created without a location directive code, Microsoft Dynamics AX searches the location directive using sequence numbers and queries to find and use an appropriate location. For more information about location directives, see [Create a location directive](create-a-location-directive.md).

## Create a work template

To create a work template, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Warehouse management** \> **Setup** \> **Work** \> **Work templates**.

2.  In the **Work order type** field, select the type of warehouse transaction for which you want to create a work template.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If you are running Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 Cumulative Update 8, the work order types <STRONG>Production order put away</STRONG> and <STRONG>Batch order put away</STRONG> have been replaced by <STRONG>Finished goods put away</STRONG> and <STRONG>Co-product and by-product put away</STRONG>. For more information, see <A href="set-up-production-processes-in-a-warehouse.md">Set up production processes in a warehouse</A>.</P>



3.  On the **Overview** tab, click **New** to create a work template.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>In the <STRONG>Sequence number</STRONG> field, the sequence in which the work is processed is displayed, in ascending order. You can modify the sequence, if needed.</P>



4.  In the **Work template code** field, enter a unique ID for the work template.

5.  Select the **Automatically process** check box to process work created by this work template when a wave is released. You should use this check box if there are inventory items that are not inventoried but must be sequenced for reporting, costing, or bill-of-lading purposes.

6.  In the **Work pool ID** field, select the unique ID for the work pool. This is used as the default work pool ID for grouping work.

7.  In the **Work priority** field, enter a value to define a work priority which can be different from the work priority that you have set in the **Warehouse management parameters** form. Work priority values are used during work flows for mobile devices, especially during work flows for system-directed work.

8.  Optional: Click **Edit query** to set the criteria that will apply to a particular work template. For example, if you want the created work template to be applied on item numbers that begin with 1000, you should set the **Field** as "Item number" and **Criteria** as "1000".
    
    1.  Click **OK** if you want to reset the grouping.
        
          - In the **Reset Grouping?** form, click **Yes** to modify the work template.
        
          - Click **No** to close the **Reset Grouping?** form.
    
    2.  In the **Edit query** form, click **Cancel** to close the form.

9.  On the **General** tab, enter additional settings for the work template by using the fields described in the following table.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><p>Field</p></th>
    <th><p>Description</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Maximum volume</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the maximum volume limit.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Maximum weight</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the maximum weight limit.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Maximum quantity</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the maximum quantity.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Maximum unit</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the maximum unit of measure (UOM).</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Batch allocation strategy</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Specify how batches are allocated during the work creation process, by either the <strong>FEFO</strong> strategy or the <strong>LEFO</strong> strategy.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Packing quantity as maximum</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Select this check box to ensure that the created work does not exceed the packing quantity limit that is specified in the load line in the <strong>Load planning workbench</strong> form.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


10. If you have Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 Cumulative Update 10 or KB 3084491 installed, you can specify work header maximums on the work template in order to split a work header when the sum or work lines exceeds the quantity specified. For example, the following additional fields will be available on the **General** tab:
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><p>Field</p></th>
    <th><p>Description</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Maximum estimated pick time</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the maximum estimated pick time. The work header will be split when the total estimated time for the initial work pick line has reached the specified value.</p>
    <div class="alert">

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Labor standard lines with a Labor standards measurement type set to Work unit will not be accounted for when calculating the pick time.</P>


    </div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Maximum number of pick lines</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the maximum number of pick lines. The work header will be split when the number of initial work pick lines reaches the specified value.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Maximum total inventory quantity</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the maximum total inventory quantity. The work header will be split when the inventory work quantity has reached the specified quantity.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Maximum total volume</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the maximum total volume. The work header will be split when the total volume of the work header has reached the specified value.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Maximum total weight</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the maximum total weight. The work header will be split when the total weight of the work header has reached the specified value.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


11. In the lower pane, set the following fields to create the actual work for the selected work template.
