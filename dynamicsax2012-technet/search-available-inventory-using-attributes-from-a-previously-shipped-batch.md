# Search available inventory using attributes from a previously shipped batch 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can search for available inventory with certain attributes using the information from previously shipped batches from which some, but not the entire inventory was shipped. When you locate the inventory batch, you can then reserve and ship the additional inventory against the remaining on-hand supply.

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Common** \> **Sales orders** \> **All sales orders**.

2.  Double-click the sales order to open the **Sales order** form.

3.  On the **Sales order line** FastTab, click **Inventory** and select **Batch reservation**.

4.  On the **Batch reservation** form, click **Batch history**. The **Batch history** form is displayed.

5.  Select the shipped inventory batch and then click **Select attributes**. The **Batch reservation** form is displayed again with a list of available inventory batches with the attributes that match the shipment you selected.

6.  To reserve inventory from one of the batches, enter the quantity in either the **Reservation** field or, if the item is a catch weight item, in the **CW reservation** field.
