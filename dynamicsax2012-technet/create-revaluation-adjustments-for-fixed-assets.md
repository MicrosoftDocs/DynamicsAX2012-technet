# Create revaluation adjustments for fixed assets 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Revaluation changes the value of an asset and can cause either an increase or decrease in the value of an asset. One of the main reasons for the revaluation of an asset is to accurately reflect the fair market price of the asset.

Revaluation, write-up adjustments, and write-down adjustments are all adjustments to the acquisition price.

  - Write-down adjustment – A downward adjustment in the accounting value of an asset. The offset account is usually a profit and loss account. This is the most common adjustment.

  - Write-up adjustment – An upward adjustment in the accounting value of an asset. The offset account is usually a different balance sheet account. This is a less common adjustment.

  - Revaluation – A change in the value of an asset. Revaluation can be used for both write-up and write-down transactions, but is a separate transaction type because revaluation proposals are available in the **Fixed assets** journal.

## Set up postings to ledger accounts
