# Microsoft Dynamics AX components 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This topic describes the components of Microsoft Dynamics AX that you can install by using the Setup wizard.

## Databases

Databases include the Microsoft Dynamics AX database, the model store, and the baseline database. The AOS connects to the Microsoft Dynamics AX database to process transactions. The AOS connects to the model store to display application elements such as forms and reports. The baseline database contains a model store that is used to upgrade X++ code to Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. The baseline database is used to analyze application updates before they are applied.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 and Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, the model store and the business data are stored in separate databases. In earlier versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, the model store and business data are stored in a single database.</P>



For information about how to install the databases, see [Install the Microsoft Dynamics AX databases](install-the-microsoft-dynamics-ax-databases.md).

Other Microsoft Dynamics AX components, such as Enterprise Portal and Reporting Services extensions, also include databases. The additional databases are created when you install those components and their prerequisites. They are not installed as part of the Microsoft Dynamics AX databases component.

## Server components

Server components include AOS and the Microsoft Dynamics AX components that run on Internet Information Services (IIS). For information about how to install one of the server components, click the corresponding link in the following table.
