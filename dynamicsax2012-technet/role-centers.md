# Role centers 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Microsoft Dynamics AX provides a set of websites that give you access to data and let you participate in business processes by using web-based forms. These sites are collectively called Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX.

Enterprise Portal can be configured to display role-specific home pages that are called *Role centers*. Role centers provide an overview of information that pertains to a user’s job function in the business or organization. This information includes transaction data, alerts, links, common tasks that are associated with a user's role in the company, and reports that are generated by Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services or Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services.

Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 includes more than two dozen predefined Role centers, which users can access from Enterprise Portal or the Microsoft Dynamics AX Windows client. For information about deploying and configuring Role centers in a business or organization, see [Configure Role Centers](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=214095) on the web.
