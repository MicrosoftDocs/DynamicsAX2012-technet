# (IND) Verify and settle duty drawback voucher transactions 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

The EXIM duty drawback process generates duty drawback lines. When you process the duty drawback lines, duty drawback voucher transactions are generated. You can use the **EXIM Duty Drawback schemes** form to view the duty drawback voucher transactions. After you verify the amounts for the duty drawback, you can settle the duty drawback transactions and record the accounting entries in the general ledger.

To view this form, you must select the **Duty drawback** check box in the **DBK** area in the **Incentive scheme parameters** form.

For more information about how to generate duty drawback lines and apply for duty drawback for an export order, see [(IND) Apply for duty drawback (DBK) for an export order](ind-apply-for-duty-drawback-dbk-for-an-export-order.md).
