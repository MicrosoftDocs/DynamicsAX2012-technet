# Calculate worker distribution 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use the **Worker distribution statistics** form to learn more about the workers in your organization by examining how they are distributed according to selected criteria.

The following procedure is an example of how you can use this form to learn about how workers are distributed in various departments by age.

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Inquiries** \> **Workers** \> **Worker distribution statistics**.

2.  In the **Groupings** field group, double-click **Department**, and then double-click **Age**.

3.  In the **Age** field, enter 5 to group your results into age groups by increments of five years.

4.  On the **Setup** tab, enter a date in the **As of** box to calculate the distribution as of a particular date.

5.  Click **Update** to display the results based on your criteria.

If you complete the above procedure, the results are displayed on the **Totals** tab. The first column lists the departments in your company, and the second column lists the age ranges of the employees in that department by increments of 5. If you have four employees, ages 20, 24, 32, and 34, who work in the same department, you will see that department listed two times in the grid, one time for each age range represented. For the age range 20 through24, the **Current FTE** column will display 2.0 for the two employees who are in that age range and who work in that department.
