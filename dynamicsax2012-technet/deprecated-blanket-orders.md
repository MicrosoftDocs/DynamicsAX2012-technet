# Deprecated: Blanket orders 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, blanket orders are contractual obligations with a vendor to purchase a specific quantity or value of merchandise in exchange for a special discount. By using a blanket order, you can continue to create purchase orders (release orders) and invoice items until the contract is fulfilled.

<td><p>Reason for deprecation</p></td>
<td><p>The blanket order feature had some limitations. Structural changes in Microsoft Dynamics AX required that blanket order functionality be deprecated.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Replaced by another feature</p></td>
<td><p>Yes. The feature is no longer available, and a replacement feature is available. This feature was replaced by purchase and sales agreements. Purchase and sales agreements are used to document the terms and conditions between a selling party and a buying party. An agreement specifies payment and delivery terms for a set of commitments. For example, the buying party commits to buying a specific volume of a product or service, such as 200 bikes, at a specific price. Alternatively, the buying party commits to buying a specific value, such as USD 1,000, of a product or products in a specific category at a specific price discount. For every commitment on the agreement, there is a validity period in which the actual trading must be completed.</p>
