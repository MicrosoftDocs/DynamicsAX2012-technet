# Create a case 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can create cases to track issues that are raised by workers and by customers. The case type determines the module where you should create the case.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Audit cases are usually created automatically when policy rule violations are found by an audit policy that is run against a set of business documents. Audit cases can also be created manually, as described in the following procedure. For more information about audit cases, see <A href="about-audit-policy-violations-and-cases.md">About audit policy violations and cases</A>.</P>



1.  Click **Home** \> **Common** \> **Cases** \> **All cases**.
    
    You can also view a list that is restricted to cases that involve auditing business documents. (Click **Compliance and internal controls** \> **Common** \> **Audit** \> **Audit cases**.)

2.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Case** tab, in the **New** group, click **Case**.

3.  Enter the name of the person that you are creating the case for and select the appropriate case category.

4.  Select the status of the case and enter a brief description.

5.  Select the priority of the case. If applicable, select the parent case.

6.  On the **Other** FastTab, select the department that is involved in the case, the worker who owns the case, and the case process that is associated with the case.

7.  Select the service level agreement (SLA) that is associated with the customer.
    
    The service level agreement is a pre-arranged agreement that determines the level of service provided to the person or organization that the case is for.

8.  On the **Case log** FastTab, enter case log information for the case and then click **Create**.
