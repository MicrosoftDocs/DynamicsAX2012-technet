# Create organization-wide card types and card numbers 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

If your business accepts credit cards, debit cards, corporate cards, and other payments by card, you must create a card payment method. You must then create the organization-wide card types and card numbers. At the organization level, set up only one card payment method for all types of card. In each store, a payment method can be set up for each card or set of cards that should be processed by using the same settings.

Use the following procedure to set up organization-wide cards.

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Payment methods** \> **Payment methods**.

2.  In the **Payment methods** form, in the **Payment method** field, enter a brief name, such as **Card**.

3.  In the **Payment method name** field, enter a brief description of the payment method.

4.  In the **Default function** field, select **Card**.

After you set up an organization-wide card type, you can set up specific credit cards, debit cards, and other card types. You can assign specific card types to specific stores. For more information about how to set up card types and card numbers, see [Set up card types and card numbers](set-up-card-types-and-card-numbers.md).
