# Assign a primary address to parties 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This task and the associated form are not available after you upgrade to Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2. Because data partitioning was added for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, addresses are now assigned during the data upgrade preprocessing. For more information about data partitioning, see <A href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=268716%26clcid=0x409">Data partitioning architecture</A> and <A href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=268717%26clcid=0x409">Plan for data partitioning</A>.</P>



In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, if a party is associated with one or more addresses, you must designate one address as a primary address. Use this form to assign the first listed address for the party as the primary address when you are upgrading from Microsoft Dynamics AX 4.0 or Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009. You are not required to define an address for a party.

1.  On the **Data upgrade checklist**, click **Assign primary addresses to parties** to open the **Parties without primary addresses** form.

2.  Review the list of parties. You can manually select the address that you want to designate as the primary address by navigating to the party record.

3.  Click the **Update addresses** button to designate the first address as the primary address for all the parties that are displayed in the list.
