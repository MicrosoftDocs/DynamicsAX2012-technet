# Transfer work breakdown estimates to project forecasts 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic describes how to create item requirements that derive from product or category estimates in a work breakdown structure (WBS) in AX 2012 R3. These product estimates can be for items, services, or category purchases.

When you create item requirements for projects by using the procedures in this topic, the requested receipt date of the items in the requirements is set to be the same as the start date of the related activity. For example, if a project activity is created for the task of hanging drywall, the requested receipt date for the required items is the same as the scheduled start of the activity. This ensures that the drywall is delivered to the work site on the date that the workers need to install it.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you don’t want to set the receipt date of the items in the requirement to match the start date of a related activity, you can change the value in the <STRONG>Delivery date control</STRONG> field in the <STRONG>Item requirements</STRONG> form.</P>



The steps that you follow to transfer WBS estimates to item requirements depend on where you begin the process. You can begin the transfer directly from a list of all item requirements, or you can begin from a work breakdown structure or project.

### Transfer WBS estimates to project forecasts directly from item requirements
