# Set up Payment Services 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can configure Microsoft Dynamics AX with Payment Services for Microsoft Dynamics ERP to process credit card transactions at retail point-of-sale (POS) registers, in online stores, and in the **Accounts receivable** module in Microsoft Dynamics AX. Payment data is captured once and flows securely from POS registers, online stores, and **Accounts receivable** through your business processes in Microsoft Dynamics AX.

Payment Services accepts a variety of payment types, and you can choose from several payment providers.

The process for setting up Payment Services includes the following steps, some performed by the retailer and others by the Microsoft Dynamics AX partner. The steps are performed in this order:

1.  Partner: In Partner Portal, create a Payment Services account for the retailer.

2.  Retailer: In Customer Portal, set up a merchant account with a payment provider.

3.  Partner: In Partner Portal, activate the payment provider.

4.  Retailer: In Customer Portal, test payment processing.

5.  Retailer: In Microsoft Dynamics AX, set up **Accounts receivable** for Payment Services.

6.  Retailer: In Microsoft Dynamics AX, set up retail stores for Payment Services.

7.  Retailer: In Microsoft Dynamics AX, set up online stores for Payment Services.

## Partner: In Partner Portal, create a Payment Services account for the retailer

1.  Sign in to [Partner Portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=265493) by using your Microsoft account email address and password.

2.  Click **Customer List**, and then click **New Customer** to add the retailer.

3.  Select the retailer in the list, click **Add Service**, and then create a Payment Services account for the retailer.

4.  In the **Add Service** form, in the **Purpose of account** field, select **Production**.

5.  Click **Service List**, select the payment service that you created in step 3, and then click **Send Activation** to send an invitation to the retailer.
    
    The retailer receives this invitation by email.

## Retailer: In Customer Portal, set up a merchant account with a payment provider

1.  In the invitation email message from your Microsoft Dynamics AX partner, click the invitation link to Payment Services, and then sign in with your Microsoft account email address and password.

2.  Under **Payment settings**, click **Payment providers**.

3.  Compare the payment providers, read their terms, and then click **Sign up now** for the provider that you want.
    
      - If you select **First Data (EMPS)**, your contact information is automatically sent to First Data Merchant Services (FDMS). FDMS will contact you to process the application.
    
      - If you select **CyberSource**, your contact information is automatically sent to CyberSource. CyberSource will contact you to process the application.
    
      - If you select another provider, follow the provider’s instructions to submit an application.

4.  Sign in to [Customer Portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=265494) by using your Microsoft account email address and password.

5.  Click **Service list**, select the check box for the payment service, and then click **Change Partner**.

6.  In the **Change support partner** form, select the partner in the list, select the **Grant service access to the selected partner** check box, and then click **Change Partner**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If you do not find your partner in the list, tell your partner to register as a partner for online services for Microsoft Dynamics ERP. For more information, see the <A href="https://mbs.microsoft.com/downloads/partner/softwareplusservices/partner_portal_provisioning_guide.pdf">Partner Portal Provisioning Guide</A>.</P>



7.  Sign out of Customer Portal.

The payment provider will contact you to process your application and set up a merchant account for you.

The process of setting up a merchant account typically includes performing a credit check, discussing terms of service, and signing a contract with the payment provider. This might take several days. This process does not involve any action in Microsoft Dynamics AX.

After your merchant account is set up with the payment provider, the payment provider provides the settings for the merchant account to you.

Provide the settings for the merchant account to your Microsoft Dynamics AX partner.
