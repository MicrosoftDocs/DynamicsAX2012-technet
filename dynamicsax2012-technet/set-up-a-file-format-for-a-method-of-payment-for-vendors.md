# Set up a file format for a method of payment for vendors 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

If you and your bank agree to share information about vendor payments by using files that can be sent electronically, you must set up the agreed-upon file formats for relevant methods of payment. You can then export and import information about the vendor payments that are made with these methods of payment.

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Setup** \> **Payment** \> **Methods of payment**.

2.  Click **New** to create a method of payment.

3.  In the **Method of payment** field, enter a unique identifier for the payment method, and in the **Description** field, enter a description.

4.  Enter appropriate values in the **Period**, **Grace period**, and **Payment status** fields, and in other fields, if appropriate. For information about each field, see [Methods of payment - vendors (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa618565\(v=ax.60\)).

5.  To open the **File formats for methods of payment** form, click the **File formats** FastTab and then click **Setup**.

6.  On the **Export** tab, move (if it is required) an appropriate field format from the **Available** pane to the **Selected** pane.

7.  Close the **File formats for methods of payment** form.

8.  For the new method of payment in the **Methods of payment - vendors** form, select the appropriate file format value in the **Export format** field.
