# (JPN) Create a consolidated invoice that includes all invoice lines 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

A consolidated invoice can include both invoice lines that are related to a purchase order and invoice lines that are not related to a purchase order. You can enter invoices that are related to a purchase order in the **Vendor invoice** form. You can enter invoices that are not related to a purchase order by using either the invoice register or the invoice journal. You can also create lines that are not associated with a purchase order without creating inventory transactions.

The same invoice may have a mixture of lines that are related to purchase orders and lines that are not related to purchase orders. The following list provides some examples of vendor invoice lines that are not based on a purchase order:

  - Subscription dues

  - Conference event registrations

  - Catering services

  - Cleaning services

<!-- end list -->

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Common** \> **Vendor invoices** \> **Open vendor invoices**.

2.  Create a new invoice.

3.  Select the **Target of consolidation** check box to indicate that the vendor invoice will be consolidated later.

4.  Post the invoice. For more information, see [Key tasks: Vendor invoices](key-tasks-vendor-invoices.md).

5.  Close the form.

6.  Create a consolidated invoice. For more information, see [(JPN) Create, confirm, reopen, and print a consolidated vendor invoice](jpn-create-confirm-reopen-and-print-a-consolidated-vendor-invoice.md).
