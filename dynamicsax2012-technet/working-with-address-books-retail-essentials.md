# Working with address books (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to create address books and how to assign teams to address books based on specific criteria. For example, you can assign teams to an address book based on legal entity or location. Before you create address books for your organization, we recommend that you determine the number of address books that your organization requires.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Retail essentials, the form that you use to complete this task includes a subset of the controls that are available for other configurations of Retail. If a topic about this form describes controls that you don't see, it may be because you’re using Retail essentials.</P>



To create address books, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Retail essentials** \> **Channels** \> **Address books**.

2.  Click **New** to create a new address book, and then enter the name and a brief description of the address book.

3.  If you are ready to assign one or more teams to the address book, click **Assign teams**. Otherwise, go to step 5.

4.  In the **Assign teams to address books** form, select the teams to which to grant access to the selected address book. Then click **Add**.

5.  Repeat step 2 through 4 for each address book that your organization requires.
