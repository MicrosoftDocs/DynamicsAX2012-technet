# About traditional financial statements 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A financial statement is a statement of an organization's financial state at the end of a defined period. It can include an operating statement (an income statement that includes the results that are shown with regard to profit and loss of typical business activities), a balance sheet (assets and liabilities), and other financial information.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic includes information about features that were added or changed for cumulative update 6 or later for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2. This information also applies to AX 2012 R3.</P>



To print financial statements, you can use Management Reporter, or you can use the traditional financial statements that are included with Microsoft Dynamics AX. For more information about how to print financial statements by using Management Reporter, see [Management Reporter for Microsoft Dynamics ERP](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=324762).

To use the traditional financial statements, you must select the **Financial statement (traditional)** configuration key.

You can design a traditional financial statement by using only ledger accounts. Because the ledger account functions as a dimension when you create traditional financial statements, the account must be set up as a dimension.

After you design a traditional financial statement, you can quickly and easily generate traditional financial statements for each financial period and for the whole year.

You can also export traditional financial statements to Microsoft Excel.

The following topics explain how to use traditional financial statements.
