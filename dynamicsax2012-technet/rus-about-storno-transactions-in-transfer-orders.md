# (RUS) About storno transactions in transfer orders 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can create a transfer order to ship items from the source warehouse and receive them at the destination warehouse.

You can generate the following issue and receipt inventory transactions:

  - Issue from a source warehouse

  - Receive at a transit warehouse

If items that were shipped from a warehouse are later returned, or if errors were made during shipment processing, you can create a storno transaction to process the return or correct the error. For more information, see [(RUS) Set up credit correction for transfer orders](rus-set-up-credit-correction-for-transfer-orders.md). The shipment transaction and the corresponding storno transaction must occur within the same accounting period.
