# Hire an applicant 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use the **Applications** list page to hire an applicant who submitted an application for employment. When you hire an applicant, a worker record for the applicant is created automatically from some of the applicant’s information.

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Common** \> **Recruitment** \> **Applicants**.

2.  Select the application that was submitted by the applicant that you are hiring, click **Change status**, and then select **Hire new worker**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can hire an applicant only if an open position exists for the job that the applicant applied for. For more information about how to create positions, see <A href="key-tasks-new-worker-positions.md">Key tasks: New worker positions</A>.</P>
    > <P>Also, you can hire only applicants who are not already employed in your company. The <STRONG>Hire new worker</STRONG> button is not available for an existing worker who submitted an application for a different position in your company. Instead of hiring the existing worker, you can transfer the worker to a new position assignment. For more information, see <A href="key-tasks-workers.md">Key tasks: Workers</A>.</P>



3.  Select the type of worker that the applicant will be. Workers can be either contractors or employees.

4.  Enter the starting and ending dates for the worker’s employment. If you specified a starting date on the application, that date is used as the starting date. If you do not know the ending date of the worker’s employment, leave the field blank.

5.  To assign a position to the worker, follow these steps:
    
    1.  In the **Position** field, select the position that you are hiring the applicant for.
    
    2.  Enter the starting date and ending date for the position assignment. If you do not know the ending date of the position assignment, leave the field blank.

6.  Click **Hire new worker**.
