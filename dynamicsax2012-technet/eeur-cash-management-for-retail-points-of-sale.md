# (EEUR) Cash management for retail points of sale 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_


> [!NOTE]

Retailers can accept various types of payment in exchange for the products and services that they sell. Although cash is the most common form of payment, retailers can also receive payment in the form of checks, cards, or vouchers.

In Retail point of sale (POS), cash, credit card receipts, and other payments are processed through a cash office. You can do the following by using Cash management in Retail:

  - Create a cash account for the selected payment method for each retail store.

  - Use cash journals to post cash transactions and customer payments that are received at a retail POS.

  - Aggregate transactions in a statement line when you post a retail statement in Microsoft Dynamics AX. You can aggregate safe drops, bank drops, voucher transactions, remove tender transactions, float entry transactions, income transactions, expense transactions, customer payments, sales transactions, and return transactions.

All transactions that take place in Retail POS are posted using a ledger journal. You can use cash payment journals, customer payment journals, and general journals to create and post the statements. For more information, go to [Create and post a statement](create-and-post-a-statement.md)
