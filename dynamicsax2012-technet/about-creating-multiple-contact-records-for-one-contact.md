# About creating multiple contact records for one contact 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A contact is a person for whom you have created a record that contains information, such as organization name, street and e-mail addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and Web page URLs. A contact person can be inside or outside your organization. You can create more than one contact record for a contact if the contact is affiliated with more than one department or organization.

For example, Contoso has a contact record for Pilar Pinilla, who works as a consultant for Northwind Traders, a Contoso vendor. Pilar continues to consult for Northwind Traders, and additionally, she starts consulting for World Wide Importers, which is another Contoso vendor. Pilar is now a contact for two vendor organizations. Because the contact information for Pilar differs depending on the vendor organization, Contoso creates a second contact record for Pilar that includes her contact information for World Wide Importers.

For more information about how to create a contact record, see [Create or delete contacts](create-or-delete-contacts.md).
