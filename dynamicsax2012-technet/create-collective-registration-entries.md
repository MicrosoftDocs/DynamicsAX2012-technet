# Create collective registration entries [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A supervisor or manager can make a collective registration for several workers. For example, for a department meeting, the manager can select all workers for the same meeting activity, and the workers do not need to make individual registrations for that meeting.

## Create a collective registration

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Periodic** \> **Time and attendance** \> **Collective registration**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a new line.

3.  In the **Activity** field, select the activity to register for each worker.

4.  Click **Start**, and in the **Inquiry** form, select the workers to start registrations for.

5.  Click **OK** to start the registration.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can view the date and starting time on the <STRONG>General</STRONG> tab in the <STRONG>Collective registration</STRONG> form.</P>



## Stop a collective registration

When the meeting is over, the manager stops the collective registration. Consequently, the workers included in the collective registration automatically resume the jobs or tasks they were working on before the collective registration.

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Periodic** \> **Time and attendance** \> **Collective registration**.

2.  Select the collective registration.

3.  Click **Stop**. The collective registration stops immediately.
