# Enter an invoice or transaction for a customer who has a direct debit mandate 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

This topic explains how to create a free text invoice for a customer who has a direct debit mandate. The process is similar for customer invoices for sales orders.

When you enter a customer invoice for a sales order or a free text invoice for a customer who has more than one direct debit mandate, you can select which mandate to use. When you print the invoice, a SEPA direct debit notification section is printed at the bottom of the invoice.

When you enter or generate interest notes, collection letters, project invoices, or journal entries, the default mandate reference that is specified for the customer is used. If necessary, you can use the **Customer transactions** form to change the mandate reference for a transaction after it has been posted.

2.  On the **Action Pane**, click **Free text invoice**.
