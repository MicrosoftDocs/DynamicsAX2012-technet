# (RUS) Set up account interval groups 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can use account interval groups instead of individual accounts in the setup of expense codes. To create an account interval group, you can group similar general ledger accounts into one account group. You can then use this group in the expense code setup. Accounts that are of the same type, from a tax accounting point of view, are collected into an account interval group.

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **Expense codes** \> **Account interval groups**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a new line.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can create separate account interval groups for items that are in production, half-finished items, finished items, and items that have been shipped.</P>



3.  In the **Interval group** field, enter the name of the account interval group.

4.  In the **Description** field, enter a description for the group.

5.  On the **Account intervals** FastTab, in the **Account (Interval: From)** field, select the starting account in the account interval.

6.  In the **Account (Interval: To)** field, select the ending account for the account interval.
