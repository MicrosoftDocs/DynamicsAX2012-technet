# Close periods in the general ledger 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The following information describes how to complete closing procedures at the end of a period. You are not required to complete all of the following steps. The modules that your legal entity uses and the options that are selected in the **License configuration** and **Security privileges** forms might prevent you from completing some steps.

To close one or more modules, use the **Ledger calendar** form. Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **Ledger**. Click **Ledger calendar**. In the left pane, select a fiscal year and period. On the **Module access level** FastTab, select the module to close. In the **Access level** field, select **None**.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Complete General ledger month-end procedures after you have completed other procedures that might generate ledger transactions. Also, you cannot close a fiscal period until all invoices for the period are posted and the <STRONG>Journalize finalized product receipt</STRONG> batch job in the <STRONG>Batch job</STRONG> form is run. For more information, see <A href="set-up-parameters-for-the-journalized-finalized-product-receipt-batch-job.md">Set up parameters for the Journalized finalized product receipt batch job</A>.</P>
