# (HUN) Move a fixed asset to an inventory using a fixed asset journal 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Normally, the inventory value of a fixed asset is calculated based on the cost of the item at purchase. To comply with Hungarian accounting law, when you move a fixed asset to inventory, the inventory value must be equal to the net book value of the fixed asset.
