# About footer text for sales quotations and other sales documents 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use the **Print management setup** form to specify the text that is printed in the footers of the original version and other copies of sales documents.

For example, when you print an original sales quotation, "Customer Copy" can be printed in the footer of one copy, and "Accounts Receivable Copy" can be printed in the footer of another copy. You can specify footer text for the following sales documents:

  - **Collection letter note**

  - **Confirmation**

  - **Customer account statement**

  - **Customer invoice**

  - **Free text invoice**

  - **Interest note**

  - **Quotation**

  - **Sales agreement confirmation**

  - **Sales order confirmation**

  - **Sales order packing slip**

Footer text is printed on all pages of a document. For example, if the original document has two pages, the footer text is printed on both pages. If no footer text is specified, the footers are blank.
