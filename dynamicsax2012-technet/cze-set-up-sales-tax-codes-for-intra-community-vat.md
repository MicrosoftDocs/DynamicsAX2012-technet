To enable intra-community VAT, do the following:

  - Click **Accounts payable** \> **Setup** \> **Accounts payable parameters**. In the left pane, click **Ledger and sales tax**, and then, on the **Sales tax** FastTab, select the **Intra-community VAT** check box.

## Set up sales tax codes for intra-community VAT

To calculate intra-community VAT for purchase transactions, you must create two sales tax codes. One code must have a positive tax percentage, and the other code must have a negative tax percentage. Tax percentages are set up in the **Values** form. For more information about setting up tax percentages, see [Values of sales tax codes (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa500790\(v=ax.60\)).

2.  Click **New**, and then enter the sales tax code and a name for the positive tax percentage code.

3.  Enter a positive sales tax percentage and tax type.

4.  On the **General** FastTab, in the **References** field group, select a settlement period and a ledger posting group.

5.  Enter any additional information.

6.  Click **New**, and then enter the sales tax code and a name for the negative tax percentage code.

7.  Enter a negative sales tax percentage and tax type.

8.  On the **General** FastTab, select the **Negative sales tax percentage** check box, and then, in the **References** field group, select a settlement period and a ledger posting group.

9.  Enter any additional information.

## Set up sales tax groups for intra-community VAT

To calculate intra-community VAT for purchase transactions, you must create a sales tax group that contains a positive and a negative sales tax code.

2.  Click **New**, and then enter the name and a description of the sales tax group.

3.  On the **General** FastTab, enter information about the country/region, the sales tax group, rounding, and date validation.
