The talents and efforts of the people in your company or organization are among your most valuable assets. Human resources for Microsoft Dynamics AX helps to fulfill the potential of your workers, while minimizing the cost and complexity of administrating worker and organizational information.

You can use Human resources to complete the following tasks:

  - Administer organizational structures, including formal and informal hierarchies and position management.

  - Maintain comprehensive worker information from the day that they first apply for a job to the day that they retire.

  - Define organizational benefit plans and options, enroll workers in benefits, assign dependent coverage, and designate beneficiaries.

  - Control absenteeism by establishing, communicating, and monitoring absence policies. This includes approval procedures and centralized or self-registration.

  - Implement and track profile-based clock in and clock out registrations for workers, enable workers to register work time for specific activities, and generate pay information that can be exported to a payroll system.

  - Manage worker competencies to identify and effectively deploy the right people for the right tasks.

  - Review performance levels through discussions, and then outline steps for improvement by creating and implementing goals for workers.

  - Set up, deliver, and analyze training courses that include agendas, sessions, and tracks, together with demographic information about participants.

  - Administer recruitment initiatives, such as web advertisements, web applications and screening, developments, applicants and applications, and correspondence with candidates.
