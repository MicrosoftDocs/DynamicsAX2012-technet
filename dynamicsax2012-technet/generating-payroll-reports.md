# Generating payroll reports 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Microsoft Dynamics AX provides a set of standard payroll reports to assist you with payroll processing and government reporting. If you have installed Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 or cumulative update 7 or later for AX 2012 R2, a Payroll data cube is also available. Use the standard reports to create pay statements and W-2 forms to issue to your workers, to validate payroll taxes and benefit amounts, and to complete federal and state regulatory reports. Use the Payroll cube to create custom reports that answer a variety of questions that you might have about your payroll data.

This topic describes functionality that is available only if the **Payroll - USA** configuration key is selected.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic includes information about features that were added or changed for cumulative update 7 or later for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2. This information also applies to AX 2012 R3.</P>



## Standard Payroll reports

The following table summarizes when and why you would use each report. For more information about how to use reports, see [Microsoft Dynamics AX reports](microsoft-dynamics-ax-reports.md).

## Custom Payroll reports in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 or cumulative update 7 or later for AX 2012 R2

The following tables provide examples of common questions you might ask, and the measures and dimensions in the data cube for Payroll that you can use to answer those questions.

After the data cube has been deployed and processed at least one time, you can use Microsoft Excel, Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services, or other tools to create custom reports based on the data in the cube. As you become more familiar with the data cube, you’ll be able to find answers to more and more of your questions.

If you have Power View configured, you can also access the data cube from the **Workers** list page. To do this, click the **Analyze data** button on the **Payroll** tab in the **Action Pane**. Power View provides quick and easy visualization of your data. When you use Power View, you can access the same measures and dimensions you would access by using Excel or SQL Server Analysis Services. After you select the dimensions and measures, you can quickly visualize raw data, adjust it to make multiple charts that correspond to each other, and save the charts to a library. You can access that library in a list format or place any chart from the library into any Role Center.


> [!TIP]
> <P>The data in the custom reports will be accurate as of the last time the cube was processed. To keep the data current, the cube should be processed frequently, for example, each night.</P>



For more information about how to create custom reports from the data in a cube, see [Create a report by using Power View to connect to a cube](create-a-report-by-using-power-view-to-connect-to-a-cube.md), [Create a report by using SQL Server Report Builder to connect to a cube](create-a-report-by-using-sql-server-report-builder-to-connect-to-a-cube.md), or [Create a report by using the Excel data connection wizard to connect to a cube](create-a-report-by-using-the-excel-data-connection-wizard-to-connect-to-a-cube.md).

## Tips

  - Some dimensions, such as those related to benefit deductions and contributions, do not contain date attributes. For these dimensions, you can’t answer questions about what a measure was during a particular time period, or how it changed over time.

  - When you work with the **Positions** dimension, you see attributes called **ValidFrom** and **ValidTo**. Use these dimension attributes when you analyze date-effective information about positions and workers.
    
    To see which details are date effective, click the **Maintain versions** button in the **Position** form to open the date manager form. All these field values have an effective date and an expiration date, which are reflected in the cube as **ValidFrom** and **ValidTo**.

  - Under the **Payroll employment** dimension, you can use a filter with the **Is position worker assignment active** dimension attribute set to **Yes** to help you view date-effective data. This attribute filters out data that is out of date. For example, if you use the **Number of employments** measure in the **Payroll workers** together with the company, department, and worker dimensions, you might see a count of 11 instead of 7 because a worker might have worked in one of the positions in a specific department in the past. The past position adds to the count unless you set **Is position worker assignment active** to **Yes**.

  - A worker can have more than one position assignment and can have an employment in more than one company at the same time. As a result, the **Number of employments** measure and the **Number of position assignments** measure in the **Payroll workers** measure group give different results when they are used with the **Company** dimension. The **Company** dimension attribute represents the legal entity. When you use it with the **Number of employments** measure, it shows the number of past, present, and future employments in the legal entity. When you use it with the **Number of position assignments** measure, it shows the total number of past, present, and future position assignments that have been assigned to workers in a company.

  - Under the **Worker** dimension, there are two dimension attributes for the names of workers, **Worker**.**Worker** and **Worker**.**Worker - Name**. The **Worker**.**Worker** attribute shows duplicates, and the **Worker**.**Worker - Name** attribute shows distinct values. When you create a report by using measures and dimensions, it doesn’t matter which one that you use; both attributes produce the same results.

  - As you work with dimensions, sometimes you see an **IsNotApplicable** dimension attribute. This attribute is added to every dimension because one row always is retained for records that are not applicable. If a measure contains any values that are not in the dimension, the measure is designated as **IsNotApplicable**.
