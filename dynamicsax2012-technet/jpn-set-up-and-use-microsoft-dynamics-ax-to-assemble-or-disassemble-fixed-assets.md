5.  On the **Detail** FastTab, specify the financial dimensions and the inventory dimensions for the component.

## Verify the inventory transaction details for an assembled component

Use the **Fixed asset components** form to verify the details for an assembled component.

1.  In the **Fixed asset components** form, in the **Assembly list** area, select an assembly list component, and then click **Inventory**.

2.  Click one of the following options to verify the inventory transaction details for the component:
    
      - **Transactions** – Opens the **Inventory transactions** form, where you can view the inventory transactions for the assembly component.
    
      - **On-hand** – Opens the **On-hand** form, where you can view the on-hand inventory of the assembly component.
    
      - **Reservation** – Opens the **Reservation** form, where you can view the quantity of the items in the on-hand inventory that are available for reservation.

After you have finished creating the assembly component list for a fixed asset, you can create and post an acquisition journal or an acquisition adjustment journal for the fixed asset to deduct the quantity of items that you specify in the **Reserved quantity** field from the on-hand inventory. For more information about how to create and post fixed asset journals, see [Journal voucher - Fixed assets (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa620564\(v=ax.60\)).

You can reverse the acquisition transactions for assembled fixed assets by clicking **Reverse transaction** in the **Fixed asset transactions** form. For more information, see [Reverse a transaction](reverse-a-transaction.md). During the reversal, a reversed component line is created for each original line and contains the same financial and inventory dimensions, cost amounts, and negative quantities.

## Disassemble a fixed asset and return items to inventory

Use the **Fixed asset components** form to reserve the list of disassembly components that can be included in inventory and reused after the fixed asset is maintained or disposed of.

You can disassemble a fixed asset in one of the following ways:

  - Add the assembly component lines to the disassembly component list by clicking **Add to disassembly list** in the **Assembly list** area for a fixed asset for which you have posted the acquisition journal or the acquisition adjustment journal.

  - Manually add an item in the disassembly component list in the **Disassembly list** area in the **Fixed asset components** form.

To disassemble a fixed asset, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Common** \> **Fixed assets** \> **Fixed assets**.

2.  Select or create a fixed asset. For more information, see [Create a fixed asset](create-a-fixed-asset.md).

3.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Fixed asset** tab, click **Componentry** \> **Components**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can define a disassembly component list for a fixed asset in the <STRONG>Fixed asset components</STRONG> form only if you select the <STRONG>Inventory assemble and disassemble</STRONG> check box in the <STRONG>Fixed assets parameters</STRONG> form, and if the fixed asset has a status of <STRONG>Open</STRONG>.</P>



4.  If you have posted an acquisition journal or an acquisition adjustment journal for an assembled fixed asset, you can use the following steps to add the assembly list components to the disassembly list:
    
    1.  In the **Fixed asset components** form, in the **Assembly list** area, select the assembly component lines to add to the disassembly component list.
    
    2.  Click **Add to disassembly list**, and then in the **Add to disassembly list** dialog box, the current quantity of the items that are used as a fixed asset component is displayed in the **Available quantity** field.
    
    3.  In the **Add** field, specify the quantity of the item that is added to the disassembly list to return to the inventory.
    
    4.  Click **OK** to add the assembly component lines to the disassembly component list in the **Disassembly list** area.
    
    Alternatively, to manually add the assembly component list to the disassembly list, follow these steps:
    
    1.  In the **Fixed asset components** form, in the **Disassembly list** area, click **Add** to create a component record, and then specify the item number, configuration, and quantity for the inventory item.

        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
    
    2.  On the **Detail** FastTab, specify the financial dimensions and the inventory dimensions of the component.

5.  Click **Calculate prices**, and then in the **Calculate net book value for each component** dialog box, select one of the following considerations to calculate the net book values of all components:
    
      - **Proportion** – All of the revaluations of the components are assessed in proportion to their original values. The acquisition dates of the components are not considered in the calculation.
    
      - **Iteration** – The fixed asset revaluation transaction does not revalue all of the components in proportion to their original values. However, the components are revalued only to the sum that is included at the time of the revaluation. Therefore, the proportions of the items are based on their revalued costs.

6.  Click **Calculate** to calculate the book cost price of the components.

## Verify the inventory transaction details for a disassembled component

Use the **Fixed asset components** form to verify the details for a disassembled component.

1.  In the **Fixed asset components** form, in the **Disassembly list** area, select a disassembly component, and then click **Inventory**.

2.  Click one of the following options to verify the inventory transaction details for the component:
    
      - **Transactions** – Opens the **Inventory transactions** form, where you can view the inventory transactions of the disassembly component.
    
      - **On-hand** – Opens the **On-hand** form, where you can view the on-hand inventory of the disassembly component.
    
      - **Lot** – Opens the **Lot** form, where you can view issue and receipt transactions for the selected component.

You can create and post a write-down regulation journal or a disposal scrap journal to disassemble the fixed asset and return the reserved components to the inventory. For more information about how to create and post fixed asset journals, see [Journal voucher - Fixed assets (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa620564\(v=ax.60\)).
