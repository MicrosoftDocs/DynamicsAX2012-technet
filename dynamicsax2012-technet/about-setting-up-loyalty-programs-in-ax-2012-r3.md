# About setting up loyalty programs in AX 2012 R3 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

A loyalty program can help increase customer loyalty by rewarding customers for buying products in your retail stores. In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, you can set up simple or complex loyalty programs that apply across your legal entities in any retail channel. You can set up the loyalty feature in AX 2012 R3 to include the following options:

  - Set up the types of rewards that you offer in your loyalty programs and track participation in your loyalty programs.

  - Set up loyalty programs to represent the different reward incentives that you offer. You can include loyalty program tiers to offer greater incentives and rewards to customers who shop more frequently or spend more money in your stores.

  - Define earning rules to identify the activities that a customer must complete to earn rewards. You can also define redemption rules to identify when and how a customer can redeem rewards.

  - Issue loyalty cards from any retail channel that participates in your loyalty programs, and link loyalty cards to one or more loyalty programs that the customer can participate in. You can also link a customer record to a loyalty card to enable the customer to pool loyalty points from multiple cards and redeem them.

  - Manually adjust loyalty cards or transfer the loyalty rewards balance from one card to another to accommodate or reward a customer.
