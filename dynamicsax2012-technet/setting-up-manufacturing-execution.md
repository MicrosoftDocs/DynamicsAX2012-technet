The topics in this section provide information about how to prepare features for manufacturing execution.

[About production parameters in Manufacturing execution](about-production-parameters-in-manufacturing-execution.md)

[Key tasks: Set up manufacturing execution](key-tasks-set-up-manufacturing-execution.md)

[About allocation keys](about-allocation-keys.md)


> [!TIP]
> <P>Allocation keys must be set up if you want workers to bundle production jobs. The bundle feature enables workers to start more than one job at the same time in the <STRONG>Job registration</STRONG> form in Manufacturing execution. When the jobs are completed, a workerâ€™s time registrations can be divided between the jobs in the bundle in different ways. The allocation keys determine how time is divided.</P>
