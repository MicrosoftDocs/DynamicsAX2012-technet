# Copy purchase requisitions 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

If you create purchase requisitions that are similar to each other, or request the same items regularly, you can copy an existing purchase requisition so that you do not have to reenter all the information. You can also copy purchase requisition lines from existing purchase requisitions and add them to your current purchase requisition. You can modify information in the copied purchase requisition before you submit it for approval.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can copy only from purchase requisitions for which you are the preparer. In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, the requisition that you copy to must have the same requisition purpose as the requisition that you copy from. For more information about requisition purposes, see <A href="about-purchase-requisitions.md">About purchase requisitions</A>.</P>



Most of the information in the header of the existing purchase requisition is copied to the new purchase requisition, such as the purchase requisition name and business justification. The requested date of the new requisition is assigned by default as either todayâ€™s date or, if there is lead time assigned to an item, a date in the future. You are assigned as the preparer.

If the requisition purpose is consumption and if you copy lines that reference an item number in Microsoft Dynamics AX, then the prices, discounts, and line charges are recalculated, based on the latest master data and trade and purchase agreements. If you copy lines that do not reference an item number in Microsoft Dynamics AX, then the prices, discounts, and charges are copied directly from the purchase requisition lines. Purchase requisition lines that reference items from an external vendor catalog cannot be copied and are ignored by the copy process. If the requisition purpose is replenishment, the site and warehouse are not copied to the new requisition.
