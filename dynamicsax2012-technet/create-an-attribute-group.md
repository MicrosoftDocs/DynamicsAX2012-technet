[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

An attribute group is used to group the attributes for a component or subcomponent in a product configuration model. The groups you create are displayed in the user interface on FastTabs. This can help a person configure a product, because the selections are arranged in a certain context.

1.  Click **Product information management** \> **Common** \> **Product configuration models**.

2.  Select the product model to add the attribute group to, and then click **User interface** on the **Action Pane**.

3.  In the **User interface** form, select the component or subcomponent to group attributes for, and then click **New attribute group** on the toolbar.

4.  In the **Name** field, enter a name for the group.

5.  Select an attribute that is assigned to the component or subcomponent that you are creating the attribute group for.

6.  In the **Attribute group** field, select the attribute group.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If you do not want to display an attribute in the user interface, select the <STRONG>Hide attribute</STRONG> check box.</P>
