# Set up reason codes for electronic signatures 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A signer selects a reason code to indicate the purpose of an electronic signature. For example, a reason code could be used to indicate legal approval.

You must set up reason codes before using electronic signatures. A valid reason code is required when signing a document.

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic signature** \> **Electronic signature reason codes**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a new record.

3.  In the **Reason code** field, enter an identification code for the new reason code. For example, you might enter LEGAL if you were creating a reason code for legal approval.

4.  In the **Description** field, enter a short description for the reason code.

5.  Close the form to save your changes.
