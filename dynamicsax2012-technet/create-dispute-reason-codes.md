# Create dispute reason codes 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

If an employee discovers an erroneous transaction on their expense report, they can file a transaction dispute. Because a transaction dispute can occur for different reasons, you can create reason codes that include information and instructions specific to a type of dispute.

1.  Click **Travel and expense** \> **Setup** \> **Disputes** \> **Dispute reason codes**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a new line.

3.  Select the credit card type and dispute type for the code.

4.  Enter a name for the dispute code and a reason for the dispute that explains the dispute type that you selected in step 3.
