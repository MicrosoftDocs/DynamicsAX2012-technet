# About loan items 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Loan items are records that help you to keep track of the physical items that your company lends to workers. The following items are examples of items that a company might lend to workers:

  - Mobile telephones

  - Automobiles

  - Computer equipment

Each physical item must have a corresponding loan item. Each loan item record should describe what is being loaned, who is responsible for the loan, and the number of days the item can be on loan. You can create multiple loan items, such as keys, access cards or uniforms, at the same time.

When loaning an item, enter the date that the item was loaned, and the planned return date. When the item is returned, enter the actual return date.

## Account for lost or misplaced loan items

If an item becomes damaged or misplaced, enter a fictitious return record. Then either delete the item or keep it in the overview and change the description to indicate that the item is not available.
