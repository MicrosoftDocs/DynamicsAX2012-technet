## Set up job types

Job types can be used to classify jobs into categories and are also useful when you set up compensation management.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Job types are not required. However, if you plan to use job types when you set up eligibility rules for compensation management, you should set up job types before you set up jobs. When you create jobs, you can then assign job types to the jobs.</P>



1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Setup** \> **Organization** \> **Job types**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Enter a name for the job type.

4.  Enter a brief description for the job type.

5.  Select one of the following options to indicate the exempt status of jobs with this job type:
    
      - **Exempt** – Jobs are exempt from overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
    
      - **Non-exempt** – Jobs are not exempt from overtime under the FLSA.
    
      - **Does not apply** – FLSA coverage is not applicable.

6.  Complete steps 2 through 5 for each additional job type.

## Set up job functions

Job functions are tasks, duties, or responsibilities that are assigned to a job and are useful when you set up compensation management. A job can have one or more job functions assigned to it.


> [!NOTE]

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Setup** \> **Organization** \> **Job functions**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Enter an identification code for the job function.

4.  Enter a brief description of the job function.

## Set up job titles

Before you create jobs, you must set up titles for those jobs. Positions inherit job titles from the jobs that the positions are associated with.

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Setup** \> **Workers** \> **Titles**.

2.  Click **New**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Enter the name for the area of responsibility.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Enter a name for the job task.
