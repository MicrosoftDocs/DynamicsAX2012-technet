# What's new: Process manufacturing production and logistics features 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, Process manufacturing production and logistics has been enhanced with the addition of new features.

The features in Process manufacturing production and logistics help chemical manufacturers control and maximize assets; minimize operating costs; and monitor the impact of decisions on orders, production, inventory, and distribution. These features offer process and hybrid manufacturers solutions that address production and distribution. The features also provide manufacturers with integrated functionality for planning and managing production, distribution, procurement, and accounting.

## What’s new in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2

  - **Potency management** – When you define an item, you can indicate that the item must have a specific concentration of an active ingredient. You can also adjust the quantity of material that is required in the production of the item, calculate the amount of money that is paid to a vendor for the item, and select an ingredient type for a formula line.

  - **Batch balancing for potency formulas** – You can add the actual value of a base inventory batch attribute to the registered inventory batch of a purchase order.

  - **Purchase pricing based on actual potency** – You can set up a pricing formula for potency items that is based on batch attributes. You can also define specific items that can be invoiced, based on the actual potency of the material that is received.

  - **Lot inheritance** – You can configure an item so that its batch attributes and shelf life information are updated based on the ingredients of the formula that is used to produce the item. You can use shelf life inheritance to define items. This means that the inventory batch with the earliest shelf life dates is updated or inherited by the product characteristics of the finished items. For batch attributes, you can define attributes for both the finished items and their ingredients, and select which ingredients pass along their characteristics or attribute values to the finished items. You can also select to have co-products updated with the same shelf life and batch attributes.

  - **Batch order sequencing** – You can use product sequencing to define one or more sequences that are assigned to various items. Product sequencing means you can sort production into a required order, so that changeover times are automatically reduced in production.
