# Introduction to Microsoft Dynamics AX Project Management and Accounting Add-in 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The Project Management and Accounting Add-in integrates with **Project management and accounting** and **Human resources**, so that you can manage projects that consist primarily of worker services. You can use the features for project management and accounting, such as contract management, quotations, budgeting, project policies, and project parameters and categories, together with the Project Management and Accounting Add-in.

Use the Project Management and Accounting Add-in to identify and schedule workers who have specific project experience, and to manage direct and indirect costs for service projects. You can also use the Project Management and Accounting Add-in to invoice customers for billing scenarios that are specific to the service industry, and to manage payments to vendors who are subcontractors on your projects.

## Key Features

The Project Management and Accounting Add-in includes the following features:

  - Other worker attributes – Assign attributes for project skills and experience to a worker. For more information, see [Set up worker attributes](set-up-worker-attributes.md).

  - Resource-based scheduling – Search for workers, and assign workers to projects when worker skills and availability match the requirements and schedules of the projects. For more information, see [Key tasks: Assign workers to projects based on availability](key-tasks-assign-workers-to-projects-based-on-availability.md).

  - Project-based scheduling – Search for workers, and assign workers to projects, based on the requirements of the projects. For more information, see [Key tasks: Create a schedule based on a project in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012](key-tasks-create-a-schedule-based-on-a-project-in-microsoft-dynamics-ax-2012.md).

  - Resource-assignment analysis – View analyses of project activities by worker, by department, and by project. For more information, see [Identify and select resources for projects](identify-and-assign-qualified-workers-to-projects.md).

  - Indirect cost components – Identify indirect costs, define calculations for indirect cost amounts, and allocate indirect costs to a project. For more information, see [About indirect costs for projects](about-indirect-costs-for-projects.md). For more information about how to set up and work with indirect costs, see [Key tasks: Create and maintain indirect costs](key-tasks-create-and-maintain-indirect-costs.md).

  - Define billing rules to calculate customer invoice amounts in the following scenarios:
    
      - Customer advance – Create a customer invoice before a project starts. For more information, see [Create a customer advance](create-a-customer-advance.md).
    
      - Project milestone – Create a customer invoice when a project activity is completed.
    
      - Per unit – Create a customer invoice when a specific unit of the project is delivered.
    
      - Customer retention – Create a customer invoice, but withhold part of the invoice amount until the project is completed.
    
      - Administrative fee – Create a customer invoice, and add an administrative fee that you and the customer have agreed on.
    
      - Customer payment retention release – Create a customer invoice when amounts that were retained by a customer are released by the customer. For more information, see [About customer payment retention for projects](about-customer-payment-retention-for-projects.md). For more information about how to set up and manage customer payment retention, see [Key tasks: Manage customer payment retention for projects](key-tasks-manage-customer-payment-retention-for-projects.md).
    
    For more information about billing rules, see [About billing rules](about-billing-rules.md). For information about how to set up billing rules, see [Create billing rules](create-billing-rules.md).

  - Vendor payment retention – Retain part of a payment to a vendor. For example, you can retain a percentage of vendor invoices until you confirm the quality of the work that the vendor performed on a project. For more information about vendor payment retention, see [About vendor payment retention for projects](about-vendor-payment-retention-for-projects.md). For more information about how to set up and manage vendor payment retention, see [Key tasks: Manage vendor payment retention for projects](key-tasks-manage-vendor-payment-retention-for-projects.md).

  - Pay when paid – Schedule payments to vendors when you receive payments from customers for projects. For more information about pay-when-paid projects, see [About pay-when-paid projects](about-pay-when-paid-projects.md). For more information about how to set up and manage pay-when-paid projects, see [Key tasks: Manage pay-when-paid projects](key-tasks-manage-pay-when-paid-projects.md).

Before you begin to work in the Project Management and Accounting Add-in, set up parameters for project management and accounting. For more information, see [Project management and accounting parameters (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/aa599440\(v=ax.60\)). By presetting these values, you can automate some of the data entry when you create documents for Project Management and Accounting Add-in transactions. You can override some of the default values when you create documents. For more information, see [About Project management and accounting parameters](about-project-management-and-accounting-parameters.md).
