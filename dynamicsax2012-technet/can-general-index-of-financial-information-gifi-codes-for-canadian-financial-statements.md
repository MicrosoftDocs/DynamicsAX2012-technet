# (CAN) General Index of Financial Information (GIFI) codes for Canadian financial statements 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The General Index of Financial Information (GIFI) is a list of accounts and information that are found on financial statements. Each item on the GIFI account list has a unique code that you can match with ledger account numbers from your chart of accounts. For example, the GIFI code for cash is 1001.

You must use GIFI codes when you submit financial statement information to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) in both paper and electronic returns.

You must complete the following tasks before you begin to use GIFI codes:

  - Set up dimensions based on your general ledger accounts by using the **Financial dimension sets** form. For more information, see [Financial dimension sets (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa597282\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Create a row definition for your company financial statement. For more information, see [Design the row structure of a traditional financial statement](design-the-row-structure-of-a-traditional-financial-statement.md).

  - Set up financial statement information for your company by using the **Financial statement** form.

  - Download the binary file of GIFI codes from [CustomerSource](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=84597).

Use the following procedures to import GIFI codes into Microsoft Dynamics AX, and then use them for financial reporting.

## Import GIFI codes from the binary file

Download the binary file of GIFI codes to your computer hard disk.

1.  In the Microsoft Dynamics AX list page, press CTRL+D to open the **AOT**.

2.  Expand the **Classes** node to select **GIFICodesToFinancialStatmentTemplate**.

3.  Right-click **GIFICodesToFinancialStatmentTemplate**, and then select **Open** to open the **Import GIFI codes** form.

4.  In the **File name** field, browse to the binary file of GIFI codes that contains the data to be imported.

5.  In the **Dimension set** field, select the financial dimension set that you set up for GIFI codes in the **Financial dimension sets** form.

6.  In the **Row definition** field, select the code for a financial statement row definition.

7.  Click **OK** to close the **Import GIFI codes** form.

8.  Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **Financial statement (traditional)** \> **Row definition**.

9.  Select the row definition that you created, and then click **Structure designer** to open the **Structure designer** form.

10. In the **Structure designer** form, view the newly imported GIFI codes.

11. Close the forms to save your changes.

## Link ledger accounts to GIFI codes

1.  In the **Structure designer** form, select ledger accounts to link to GIFI codes. For information about linking ledger accounts to GIFI codes, see [Structure designer (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa552297\(v=ax.60\)).

2.  When you have finished linking accounts to GIFI codes, close the **Structure designer** form.

## Create row definitions for financial statements that include GIFI codes

You must set up a row definition for each set of GIFI codes that you plan to use for financial statements. For example, to print a balance sheet that includes GIFI codes for ledger accounts, you must set up a definition with GIFI codes for the balance sheet. To print a profit and loss statement that includes GIFI codes, you must set up a definition with GIFI codes for the profit and loss statement.

1.  Use the **Row definition** form to create row definitions for a financial statement that includes GIFI codes.

2.  In the **Row definition** form, click **Print** to print a row definition structure report.

3.  Verify the general ledger accounts and GIFI codes.
