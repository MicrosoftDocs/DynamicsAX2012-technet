# Set up address and contact information purposes 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can assign one or more purposes to a postal address record or a contact information record. A purpose describes how a particular address record or contact information record is used. The following table shows an example of the list of addresses for a customer, and the purposes that are assigned to each postal address.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Postal address</p></th>
<th><p><strong>Address purpose</strong></p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Eislebener Street/67</p>
<p>12345 Berlin</p>
<p>Germany</p></td>
<td><p><strong>Primary</strong>, <strong>Delivery</strong>, <strong>RemitTo</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Thierschstrasse 12</p>
<p>56789 Munich</p>
<p>Germany</p></td>
<td><p><strong>Delivery</strong>, <strong>Service</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>An der Budesstrasse 123</p>
<p>34567 Neu-Isenburg/Frankfurt</p>
<p>Germany</p></td>
<td><p><strong>One time</strong></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


For example, if a customer record contains a postal address for each of the customer's four locations, you can assign a purpose to each postal address. The purpose can help you track where deliveries must be sent, where services are needed, or where mail is sent by using the postal service.

## Predefined purposes

Microsoft Dynamics AX includes several predefined purposes. You can also create your own purposes to meet the requirements of your organization. The following table describes the purposes that are included in Microsoft Dynamics AX.
