# View your alert rules (Enterprise Portal) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Alerts are generated as part of a notification system that helps you track events in Microsoft Dynamics AX. For example, you can receive alerts when there are overdue deliveries, or when prices have changed.

Alerts are issued based on the alert rules that are set up for you in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client. When alert rules are created, they are associated to a predefined event for a field, such as a date value being overdue or a field value changing, or to an event that occurs for records for a specific form, such as a record being created or deleted. When the selected event occurs for a specified field or for a record in the specific form, you receive an alert.

You can view the alert rules that have been set up for you in Enterprise Portal, but you must use the Microsoft Dynamics AX client to create or modify alert rules. To view the alert rules that have been set up for you, complete the following steps.

1.  Click **Home** on the top link bar, and then click **Alert rules** on the Quick Launch. The **Alert rules** page is displayed.

2.  View information about each alert rule, such as the event and the field or form for which the alert rule is set up.
