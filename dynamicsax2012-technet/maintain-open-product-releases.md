# Maintain open product releases 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

An open product release is created when the release of a product cannot be completed. An incomplete release can, for example, occur if the product, the product master, or the product variants that are included in the release session already exist in the company that you attempt to release to.

## Maintaining open product releases

Open product releases can be tracked from the **Open product releases** form. From this form, you can filter on the time of the release failure and the user who initiated the release. You can also perform the following tasks:

  - Troubleshoot why a product failed to be released. For this purpose, you use separate Infologs for products and product masters and for variants.

  - Delete obsolete release sessions.

  - Resolve issues and repeat the release. For example, if the release failed because the product master of a product variant already exists in the target company, you can exclude the product master from the release to resolve the issue.

## Track open product releases

1.  Click **Product information management** \> **Periodic** \> **Open product releases**.

2.  Select a release session in the **Release session** field.

## Troubleshoot open product releases

    > [!TIP]
    > <P>If the <STRONG>Infolog</STRONG> field contains a <STRONG>Yes</STRONG>, there is a release issue that is related to the product. There are separate buttons of the type <STRONG>View infolog</STRONG> for products and product variants. The messages that are displayed for products and product variants depend on the problem that occurred during the release session.</P>
