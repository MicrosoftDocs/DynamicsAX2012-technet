# About sum recalculations and posting of rounding differences 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The following information explains where differences in rounding might occur.

  - If prices of products have been converted to zero, a report is printed, which displays the product number, module type, price before the conversion, and unit.

  - Rounding differences between sales tax and the general ledger are posted to the general journal.

  - Foreign currency revaluation amounts are recalculated and customer and vendor transaction amounts are recalculated.

  - Customer and vendor settlement records are created for rounding differences for each customer and vendor transaction.

  - Rounding differences for customers and vendors are posted to the general journal.

  - Settled cost amounts and cost adjustment amounts in closed inventory transactions are recalculated.

  - Rounding differences in Inventory management are posted to the general journal.

  - On-hand inventory is recalculated.

  - Total amounts in ledger journals are recalculated.

  - Ledger closing sheets are recalculated.

  - Ledger balances are recalculated.

  - Rounding differences in General ledger are posted to the general journal.

  - Opening ledger transactions are recalculated.

  - The final amount in the ledger balances is calculated.

If you convert to a new ledger accounting currency, and an error has occurred during the recalculation of total amounts or the posting of rounding differences, you must close the **Ledger accounting currency conversion** form. The total amounts will be recalculated and the rounding differences will be posted.

You must close Microsoft Dynamics AX and restart it when the conversion date in the **Ledger accounting currency conversion** form is changed.
