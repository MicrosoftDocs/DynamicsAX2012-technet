# View your alerts (Enterprise Portal) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Alerts are generated as part of a notification system that helps you track events in Microsoft Dynamics AX. For example, you can receive alerts when there are overdue deliveries, or when prices have changed. Alerts are issued based on the alert rules that are set up for you.

To create or modify alert rules, you must use the Microsoft Dynamics AX client. For more information, see the Help in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client.

Alerts are displayed in the **Work list** Web part in Enterprise Portal. Select an alert in the **Work list** Web part, and then right-click the alert to view the available options for that alert.
