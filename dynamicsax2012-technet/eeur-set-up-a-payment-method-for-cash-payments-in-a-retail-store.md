1.  Click **Retail** \> **Common** \> **Retail channels** \> **Retail stores**.

4.  In the **Payment method** form, create a payment method. For more information about creating a payment method for a retail store, see [Set up store payment methods](set-up-store-payment-methods.md).

5.  On the **Posting** FastTab, in the **Account** field group, in the **Account type** field, select **Cash account**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can select <STRONG>Cash account</STRONG> in the <STRONG>Account type</STRONG> field only if you select <STRONG>Normal</STRONG> or <STRONG>Tender remove/float</STRONG> in the <STRONG>Function</STRONG> field.</P>



6.  In the **Account number** field, select a cash account number for the payment method.

7.  In the **Tender remove/float** field group, in the **Offset account** field, select the offset account to post remove tender or float entry transactions for the payment method.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You must set up offset accounts for both the cash tender payment method and the remove tender or float entry payment method for a store to create balanced general ledger entries for remove tender or float entry transactions.</P>
