## Get started

To configure **Transportation management** for your company’s distribution requirements, you must enable rating and routing and deploy the transportation management engines. For example, you can use rating and routing to compare prices across carriers, which is enabled when you set up the transportation management engines.

Here’s what you need to do to set up and configure distribution requirements for **Transportation management**.

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Manage appointment schedules

To optimize the flow of items into and out of warehouse locations, you can use the appointment scheduling feature in **Transportation management**. For example, you can manage the availability of docks for loading and unloading items to avoid issues if multiple carriers arrive at a location at the same time. You can also receive notifications for scheduled appointments.

Here’s what you need to do to set up and use appointment scheduling.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

</tr>

## Handle inbound and outbound flows

To handle flows of inventory items into and out of a company’s warehouse location to a customer or intermediate location, you can create loads. You can plan rates and routes for the loads. You can also pick, put, and pack for outbound orders using Microsoft Dynamics AX on a computer or a mobile device.

Here’s what you need to do to create and handle loads for inbound and outbound orders.
