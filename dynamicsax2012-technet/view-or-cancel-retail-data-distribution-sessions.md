# View or cancel retail data distribution sessions 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

The **Download sessions** form and the **Upload sessions** form show information about data distribution jobs that are in progress or have been completed. A run of a job is referred to as a session. Use the information in these forms for troubleshooting. You can also run a session again or cancel a session from these forms.

To display complete status information in these forms, you must run the batch job that processes status messages for Commerce Data Exchange. For more information, see [Process status messages for data exchange](process-status-messages-for-data-exchange.md).

This topic includes the following information:

  - View information about download sessions

  - View information about upload sessions
