# (ITA) Set up information for the \"Italian black list\" report 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Legal entities must report all taxable sales and purchase transactions with other companies in countries that offer privileged tax structures. These countries are referred to as “black listed” countries by the Italian government. These countries present a high risk from a tax standpoint. Legal entities in Italy must report these transactions on a monthly or quarterly basis to the government.

You must complete the following setup procedures before you generate the “Italian black list” report and export it as an ASCII file:

  - Set up a country or region as "black listed"

  - Set up the legal nature of a legal entity

  - Set up the country/region of residence for a foreign customer

  - Set up the country/region of residence for a foreign vendor

  - Set up the VAT type for a sales tax code

## Set up a country or region as "black listed"

Use the **Foreign trade parameters** form to identify a country as “black listed” and the **Address setup** form to specify the county code for a “black listed” country.

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Foreign trade** \> **Foreign trade parameters**.

2.  Click the **Country/region properties** link.

## Set up the legal nature of a legal entity

Use the **Legal entities** form to specify the legal nature of a legal entity. The legal nature is the legal structure that is registered with the government, such as **Limited share partnerships**, **Limited liability companies (SRL)**, or **Public limited companies (SPA)**.

## Set up the VAT type for a sales tax code

Use the **Sales tax codes** form to set up the type of tax to be calculated for the “Italian black list” report, such as **Standard**, **Zero**, **Exempt**, or **Not subject to VAT**. The VAT type that is specified determines the category where the net and VAT amounts for the invoices are printed on the report and where they are located in the file.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If the total net or VAT amount that is invoiced in a period is negative for a specific VAT type, it appears as credit for the previous period (or previous year, if the period starts in January).</P>

2.  Select or create a sales tax code.

3.  Click the **Calculation** FastTab.

      - **Standard** – The transaction includes a standard VAT amount.
    
      - **Zero** – The transaction does not include a VAT amount.
    
      - **Exempt** – The transaction is exempted from VAT.
