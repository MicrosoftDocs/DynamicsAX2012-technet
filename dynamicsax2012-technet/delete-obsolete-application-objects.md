After you have verified the integrity of your upgraded system and operated it successfully for several months, we recommend that you disable the **Keep update objects 5.0** and **Keep update objects 6.0** configuration keys. When you disable these keys, obsolete application objects that have the prefix DEL\_ will be deleted.
