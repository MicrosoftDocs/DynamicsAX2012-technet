# System diagnostics (Lifecycle Services, LCS) 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]

In Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services, System diagnostics helps administrators monitor and understand the health of one or more Microsoft Dynamics AX environments. It is a cloud-based tool that has a locally-installed component that can be configured to perform the following tasks:
-   Discover on-premises Microsoft Dynamics AX environments (database instances and Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Object Server (AOS) instances).
-   Collect data from the environments that were discovered.
-   Run rules on the collected data.
-   Report rule violations on a dashboard.
-   Provide reports.

Data is collected by using jobs that run on predefined schedules. The following diagram describes how System diagnostics and the locally-installed components interact.
