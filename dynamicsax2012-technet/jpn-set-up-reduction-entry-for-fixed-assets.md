# (JPN) Set up reduction entry for fixed assets 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

When you acquire a fixed asset using a government subsidy, the subsidy is treated as taxable revenue and can be registered in Microsoft Dynamics AX by using a reduction entry. You can use the following reduction entry methods to register the government subsidy for a fixed asset acquisition.

  - **Direct-off method** – The government subsidy amount is deducted directly from the acquisition cost of the fixed asset.

  - **Reserve method** – The government subsidy amount is maintained as a separate value on the equity side of the balance sheet. The government subsidy amount does not affect the net book value of the fixed asset.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic has been updated for functionality that is included in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 Cumulative Update 8.</P>



Follow the steps in this topic to set up a reduction entry document, and then assign the reduction entry document to a fixed asset or to multiple fixed assets. You can set up a fixed asset posting profile for reduction entry. You can also set up accounts for the transactions of type disposal. The transaction amounts are retrieved from these accounts when you post a fixed asset with reduction entry using the direct–off method.

## Optional: Assign a reduction entry document to a fixed asset

Use the **Fixed assets** form to assign a reduction entry document to a fixed asset. AX 2012 R2 uses the details of the reduction entry document that you assign to a fixed asset to calculate and post reduction entry amounts for the fixed asset.

To perform this task, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Common** \> **Fixed assets** \> **Fixed assets**.

2.  Double-click the fixed asset that you have received the subsidy for, and then click **Edit**.

3.  On the **General** FastTab, in the **Reduction entry document** field, select the reduction entry document for the fixed asset.

4.  In the **Document date** field, select the date from which the document is effective.

When you update the reduction entry details for a fixed asset, the reduction entry details are updated for the value models and depreciation books that are associated with the fixed asset. You can modify the reduction entry details for a value model that is associated with a fixed asset in the **Reduction entry document** and **Document date** fields on the **General** tab in the **Value models** form. You can modify the reduction entry details for a depreciation book that is associated with a fixed asset in the **Reduction entry document** and **Document date** fields on the **General** tab in the **Depreciation books** form.

## Optional: Assign a reduction entry document to multiple fixed assets

Use the **Mass update for reduction entry document** form to assign a reduction entry document to multiple fixed assets. AX 2012 R2 uses the details of the reduction entry document that you assign to the fixed assets to calculate and post reduction entry amounts for the fixed assets.

1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Periodic** \> **Reduction entry document mass update**.

2.  Click **New** to create a line.

3.  In the **Fixed asset number** field, manually select the fixed assets to assign the reduction entry document to. Alternatively, you can click **Select fixed assets** to open the **Select criteria to pick up the candidates fixed asset into pools** form, where you can create an inquiry to filter the fixed assets to assign the reduction entry document to.

4.  Click **Assign reduction entry document**.

5.  In the **Document ID** field, select the reduction entry document to assign to the fixed assets.

6.  In the **Assign to lines** field, specify what fixed assets to assign the reduction entry document type to. Use the following table to decide what fixed assets to assign the selected document to.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><p>Option</p></th>
    <th><p>Consideration</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>All lines</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Select this option to assign the reduction entry document to all of the fixed assets in the <strong>Mass update for reduction entry document</strong> form.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Lines without a reduction entry document</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Select this option to assign the reduction entry document to all of the fixed assets in the <strong>Mass update for reduction entry document</strong> form that do not have a reduction entry certificate assigned.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Selected lines</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Select this option to assign the reduction entry document only to the fixed assets that you selected in the <strong>Mass update for reduction entry document</strong> form.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


7.  Click **Assign**.

## 2\. Set up a fixed asset posting profile for reduction entry

Use the **Fixed asset posting profiles** form to set up a posting profile for reduction entry. You can also set up a posting profile to depreciate the asset that is applied with a reduction entry.

To set up the fixed asset posting profile for reduction entry, follow these steps:
