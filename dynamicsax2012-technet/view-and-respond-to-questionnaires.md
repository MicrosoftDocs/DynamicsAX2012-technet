_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Your customer uses questionnaires to understand your organization, its operations, and its products. You can view and respond to questionnaires in the vendor self-service portal.

If you request to provide products in additional procurement categories, there might be a questionnaire for a procurement category that you include in your request. For more information about requesting additional procurement category assignments, see [Manage your category assignments](manage-your-category-assignments.md).

1.  On the **Home** page, click **Questionnaires**. On the Quick Launch, click **Questionnaires to complete**.

2.  Select the questionnaire that you want to complete, and then click **Start**.
    
    Depending on the questionnaire setup, some or all of the following buttons are available:
    
      - **Overview** – Display all questions in a questionnaire.
    
      - **Note** – Display or hide a box in which you can enter text, for example, to expand your answer.
    
      - **Back** – Return to the previous question.
    
      - **Forward** – Proceed to the next question.
    
      - **End** – Save your answers and close the questionnaire.
    
      - **Cancel** – Close the questionnaire without saving your answers.

3.  If your customer sets a time limit for the questionnaire, you must complete the questionnaire using the following options:
    
      - Complete the questionnaire in one session, in the specified time limit.
    
      - Complete only all the mandatory questions in the specified time limit.
    
    If you do not finish all mandatory questions before the time limit of the questionnaire, your partial responses are deleted. You can restart the questionnaire, which restarts the time to complete the questionnaire.

4.  When you have completed all the mandatory questions and any optional questions, click **Actions**, and then click **Submit**. You can add an optional comment before you submit the questionnaire for review by your customer.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The <STRONG>Submit</STRONG> button is available only if you have completed all mandatory questions in the questionnaire.</P>
