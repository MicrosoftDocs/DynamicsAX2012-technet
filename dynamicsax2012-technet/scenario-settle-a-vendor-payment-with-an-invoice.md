## Option 1: Pay an invoice based on the invoice amount

On February 1, April pays the vendor for invoice Inv\_10200. There is a question about Inv\_10100, so April does not want to pay that invoice yet. April enters the payment and settles the payment with invoice Inv\_10200 by following these steps.

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Journals** \> **Payments** \> **Payment journal**.

2.  Create a journal, and then click **Lines** to open the **Journal voucher** form for payment journal lines.

3.  In the **Account** field, select vendor 3064.

4.  Click **Functions** \> **Settlement**.

5.  In the **Settle open transactions** form, select the **Mark** check box on the line for invoice Inv\_10200. The remaining invoice amount, minus any available cash discount, is displayed in the **Amount to settle** field. No cash discounts are available for this invoice. Therefore, the amount is 500.00.

6.  Close the **Settle open transactions** form. The payment line that has information from the invoice is displayed in the **Journal voucher** form. The payment line contains the amount from the vendor invoice. This amount is the amount that the legal entity can pay to the vendor.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>In the <STRONG>Journal voucher</STRONG> form, click <STRONG>Inquiries</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Balance control</STRONG> to verify that the amount of the payment that is made to the vendor does not exceed the balance of the bank account.</P>



7.  Click **Functions** \> **Generate payments**.

8.  Select an export format, and then select the bank account from which the payment is drawn.

9.  In the **Generate payments** form, click **Dialog**, enter information in the fields, and then click **Document** to specify a printer destination.

10. Click **OK** to close the **Printer setup** form, and then click **OK** to close the dialog box.

11. In the **Generate payments** form, click **OK**.

12. Click **Validate** \>**Validate voucher only** to validate the payment line, and then click **Post** \> **Post and transfer**.

The balance for vendor 3064 is now 100.00. Invoice Inv\_10200 is fully settled. Therefore, the balance for that invoice is 0.00.

## Option 2: Pay a specified amount and settle an invoice

On February 1, April makes a payment of 500.00 to vendor 3064. April settles the payment with invoice Inv\_10100 and makes a partial payment on invoice Inv\_10200 by following these steps.

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Journals** \> **Payments** \> **Payment journal**.

2.  Create a journal, and then click **Lines** to open the **Journal voucher** form for payment journal lines.

3.  In the **Account** field, select vendor 3064.

4.  Select the description.

5.  In the **Debit** field, enter 500.00.

6.  Click **Functions** \> **Settlement**.

7.  In the **Settle open transactions** form, select the **Mark** check box on the lines for invoices Inv\_10100 and Inv\_10200.

8.  On the line for invoice Inv\_10100, in the **Amount to settle** field, accept the default value of 100.00.

9.  On the line for invoice Inv\_10200, in the **Amount to settle** field, change the default value of 500.00 to 400.00.

10. Close the **Settle open transactions** form.

11. In the **Journal voucher** form, click **Functions** \> **Generate payments**.

12. Select an export format, and then select the bank account from which the payment is drawn.

13. Click **Dialog**, enter information in the fields, and then click **Document** to specify the printer destination.

14. Click **OK** to close the **Printer setup** form, and then click **OK** to close the dialog box.

15. In the **Generate payments** form, click **OK**.

16. Click **Validate** \> **Validate voucher only** to validate the payment line, and then click **Post** \> **Post and transfer**.

The balance for vendor 3064 is now 100.00. Invoice Inv\_10100 is fully settled. Therefore, the balance for that invoice is 0.00. For invoice Inv\_10200, 400.00 is settled, and the remaining balance is 100.00.
