A tax registration group includes tax registration numbers of different tax types. You can create a tax registration group to set off the recoverable tax from one tax type to another. Select the tax registration group in the **Sales tax payment** form to process the settlement of the tax to the authority


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You cannot select registration numbers of the same tax type more than once in a tax registration group except for the <STRONG>Sales</STRONG> tax type. You can attach more than one registration number of a <STRONG>Sales</STRONG> tax type in a tax registration group, but cannot repeat the same registration number.</P>



1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **Sales tax** \> **India** \> **Tax registration group**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If the registration number in use belongs to other groups, then the <STRONG>In use</STRONG> check box is selected for the other groups.</P>
