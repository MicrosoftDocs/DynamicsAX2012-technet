Electronic signature is a regulations compliance requirement for several regulated industries, such as pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, and aerospace and defense. It is also a necessary part of compliance with the regulations in 21 CFR Part 11 issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States.

An electronic signature confirms the identity of a person who is about to start a process or approve a process. In some industries, an electronic signature is as legally binding as a handwritten one.
