# (BRA) Set up project parameters 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can group project transactions that you create for hour, expense, on-account, or item project transactions by different criteria such as transaction text, employee, invoice type, or transaction lines before you print the fiscal document lines. You can also specify the default Código Fiscal de Operações e Prestações (CFOP) codes for the same state, a different state, or outside the country or region when you generate fiscal documents from project transactions. You can split project invoices based on service code when you post the invoice.

You can set up the default unit to use in fiscal document lines that are created for hour, expense, on-account, or item project transactions in the **Unit** field in the **Brazilian parameters** form. For more information, see [(BRA) Set up Brazilian parameters](bra-set-up-brazilian-parameters.md).

2.  Click **Invoice**.

3.  In the **Invoice** area, select the **Transaction text** check box to group project transactions by transaction text to generate and print project fiscal documents.
