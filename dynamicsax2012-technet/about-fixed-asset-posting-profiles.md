# About fixed asset posting profiles 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Posting profiles specify the ledger accounts that are affected when fixed asset transactions are posted. You can select different ledger accounts for each type of asset transaction.

You must set up at least one posting profile, and many organizations will need only one. You can use additional posting profiles when the same asset transactions for the same asset must be posted differently in certain situations.

For each transaction type, set up a ledger account and an offset account. If the ledger account is the part of the fixed asset transaction that changes the value of fixed the asset, enter a balance sheet account. If the offset account is for the fixed asset income or expenditure, enter a profit and loss account.
