# (AUS) Transfer one asset to a low-value pool 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use the **Transfer asset to low value pool** form to transfer low-cost and low-value assets to a low-value pool.

Although you can transfer assets to a low-value pool from the **Value models** form, you must use the **Depreciation books** form to transfer low-value pool assets into a low-value pool. For more information, see [(AUS) About low value pool depreciation](aus-about-low-value-pool-depreciation.md).

1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Common** \> **Fixed assets** \> **Fixed assets**.

2.  Select a fixed asset group.

3.  Open one of the following forms:
    
      - Click **Value models** to open the **Value models** form.
    
      - Click **Depreciation books** to open the **Depreciation books** form.

4.  Select a value model or depreciation book that contains one or more low-cost or low-value assets.

5.  In the **Value models** or **Depreciation books** form, click **Functions** \> **Transfer asset to low value pool** to open the **Transfer asset to low value pool** form.

6.  Select the asset number and specify the value model or depreciation book to transfer the asset to.

7.  In the **Transaction date** field, select the transaction date, or accept the default date.

8.  In the **Name** field, select the fixed asset journal that will be used to post the transfer transaction.

9.  In the **Low value pool type** field, select a low-value pool type to identify the category for the asset.

10. Click **OK** to transfer the transactions to the fixed asset journal.

11. Close the forms to save your changes.
