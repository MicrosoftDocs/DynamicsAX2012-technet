Businesses that supply goods to companies in other European Union (EU) countries or regions can generate periodic EU sales list reports. You can generate the EU sales list on a monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, or yearly basis.

You must perform the following tasks before you can generate the EU sales list.

  - Set up a country or region code. For more information, see [Key tasks: Set up address formats](key-tasks-set-up-address-formats.md).

  - Create a customer group and a customer record. For more information, see [Create a customer group](create-a-customer-group.md) and [Create a customer record](create-a-customer-record.md).

  - Create products and services. For more information, see [Key tasks: Define products](key-tasks-define-products.md).

  - Set up Intrastat parameters for the EU sales list. For more information, see [About Intrastat](about-intrastat.md) and [Set up Intrastat from a free text invoice](set-up-intrastat-from-a-free-text-invoice.md).

  - Create and post sales orders. For more information, go to [Create or edit a sales order](create-or-edit-a-sales-order.md) and [Key tasks: Customer invoices](key-tasks-customer-invoices.md).

  - Create and post free text invoices. For more information, see [Key tasks: Free text invoices](key-tasks-free-text-invoices.md).

  - Create project invoices. For more information, see [About invoicing](about-invoicing.md) and [Create and post invoice proposals](create-and-post-invoice-proposals.md).
