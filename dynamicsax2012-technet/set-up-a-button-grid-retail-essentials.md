# Set up a button grid (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to create a set of buttons to display on a point-of-sale (POS) register. Buttons are displayed in a grid, and each grid contains a group of similar buttons, such as buttons for products, operations, or payments. After you create button grids, you can add properties to each button, such as its appearance and function. For more information about adding properties to a button, see [Set up buttons (Retail essentials)](set-up-buttons-retail-essentials.md).

When you create a grid, buttons are created based on the number of columns and rows that you specify. For example, if you create a grid that has four columns and five rows, 20 buttons are created. Retail essentials can display up to five button grids in a screen layout.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can set up a button grid only if you have been granted permissions to the database. For more information about permissions, see <A href="set-up-permission-groups-and-operations-retail-essentials.md">Set up permission groups and operations (Retail essentials)</A>.</P>
