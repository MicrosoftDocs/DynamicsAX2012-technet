# (RUS) About goods flow registers 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

In tax accounting, goods refer to raw materials, purchased and produced items, services, and work. Expenses that are incurred when raw materials, services, and work are acquired are divided into direct and indirect costs. Expense codes are created for each type of expense. Direct costs include costs of raw materials and other materials that are essential for produced output. To reduce the taxable profit base, only expenses for materials that are used in production, or that are realized in the current period, are taken into account. Expenses that are related to unfinished production and unrealized products are excluded from current period expenses.

All other costs for the acquisition of items are considered indirect costs. These costs reduce the taxable profit base for the period that they are consumed in.

For purchased warehoused goods, there is no unfinished production. Therefore, a write-off from the warehouse leads to the generation of an expense.

You can set up and use goods flow registers to calculate the expenses that are incurred when items are produced or purchased. The following registers are collectively referred to as goods flow registers:

  - **Warehoused items**

  - **Warehoused items (totals)**

  - **Non warehoused items**

  - **Goods issued**
