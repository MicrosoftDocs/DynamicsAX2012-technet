_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Customer service supports professional, service-based companies and manufacturing service organizations.

Customer service includes the following functionality:

  - Key processes for service management, such as service agreements, service orders, and return management

  - An advanced setup for repair management that includes tracking of repairs and versioning for bills of materials (BOMs)

  - Support for employee roles, such as service manager, dispatcher, and service technician or service consultant

  - Service subscriptions, which can generate periodic streams of revenue that are independent of the frequency of service

  - Service-level agreements that support a differentiated customer base

The topics in this section provide an overview of the Customer service business process and each business process component. They also list the forms that are associated with each business process component, and they discuss the tasks that are associated with each business process component.
