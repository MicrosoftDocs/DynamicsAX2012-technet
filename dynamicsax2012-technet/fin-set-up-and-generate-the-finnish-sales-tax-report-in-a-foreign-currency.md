# (FIN) Set up and generate the Finnish sales tax report in a foreign currency 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can set up a foreign currency for a sales tax code, and then generate the sales tax report in the foreign currency. Alternatively, you can generate the sales tax report in a foreign currency that you specify in the **Finnish sales tax report** form.

You can generate the Finnish sales tax report in a foreign currency in the following scenarios:

  - When the currency of the legal entity is different from the currency of the country where the legal entity is based, you can generate the sales tax report in the currency of the country where the legal entity is based.

  - When the currency of the legal entity is the same as that of the country where the legal entity is based, but the legal entity must generate sales tax reports in the currency of another country, you can generate the sales tax report in the currency of that country. For example, a legal entity that is a global firm that has subsidiaries in other countries, and which uses a primary currency for all of the subsidiaries, can generate the sales tax report in the currency of the country where a subsidiary is based instead of the primary currency of the legal entity.
