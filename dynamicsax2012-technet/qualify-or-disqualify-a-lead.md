# Qualify or disqualify a lead 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Depending on your organizationâ€™s configuration of this program, you may have to qualify a lead record to advance it to the next step in the business process. If you learn that a lead is no longer a potential sale, you can disqualify the lead to avoid spending more time with it.

## Qualify a lead record

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Common** \> **Leads** \> **All leads**.

2.  Double-click a lead record to open the **Leads** form.

3.  Click **Change status** \> **Qualify**.

4.  Select the reason why the lead record is qualified, and then click **OK**.

5.  Close the forms to save your changes.

You can set up Lead management to automatically create an opportunity or customer record when a lead is qualified. If your organization has selected this setup option, the forms automatically open after you qualify a lead record.

## Disqualify a lead record

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Common** \> **Leads** \> **All leads**.

2.  Double-click a lead record to open the **Leads** form.

3.  Click **Change status** \> **Disqualify**.

4.  Select the reason why the lead record is disqualified and then click **OK**.

5.  Close the forms to save your changes.
