# Create goal types 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Before you can set goals for workers, you must first create goal types. Goal types help organize goals into manageable categories. You also can use goal types to provide guidance and structure for the person who is to achieve the goal by creating user-defined fields for the goal template.

## Create a goal type

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Setup** \> **Performance** \> **Goal types**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Enter a unique name for the goal type.

4.  Enter a brief description of the goal type. When you select a goal type in the **Goal details** form, the goal type descriptions, along with the goal type name, are displayed.

5.  Optional: On the **General** FastTab, enter more detailed information about the goal type. For example, you might enter a typical timeline for achieving goals of this type.

6.  Optional: On the **User-defined fields** FastTab, add additional fields for users who create goals of this type to complete.

## Add user-defined fields to a goal type

You can create additional fields for a specific goal type that will be displayed for users when they create goals of that type. For example, if you have a goal type titled “Pass certification test” and you want users to include their scores in the details for the goal, you might create a user-defined field titled “Test score” for the “Pass certification test” goal type.

User-defined fields for goal types are displayed on the **Additional goal information** FastTab in the **Goal details** form.

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Setup** \> **Performance** \> **Goal types**.

2.  Select the goal type to create additional fields for.

3.  On the **User-defined fields** FastTab, click **Add**.

4.  Enter the sequence number of the field. This value determines where, in the order of other user-defined fields for the selected goal type, this field appears.

5.  In the **Subject** field, enter the name of the new user-defined field.
