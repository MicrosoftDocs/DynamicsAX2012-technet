Use the **Database logs** page to view and filter data from the database log, which is a list of who made changes to the database, and when the changes were made. The view is sorted by table name and shows a description of the record, type of change, created time, created date and time, user who created the record, current value, and previous value. You can select a range of dates for which to view information.
