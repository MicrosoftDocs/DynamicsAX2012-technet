You must configure the printers in your system before you define the destination for a printer in the **Print management setup** form. A printer that is configured in the system should not be changed or deleted after you define it for a document in the **Print management setup** form.

1.  Click **Cash and bank management** \> **Setup** \> **Print management**.

2.  To create a new record, right-click on **Bank check** and select **New**. A new original or copy record is created and is displayed in the list.
