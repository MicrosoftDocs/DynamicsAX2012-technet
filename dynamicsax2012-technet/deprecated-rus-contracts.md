# Deprecated: (RUS) Contracts 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Russian installations of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009 let users perform the following tasks:

  - Register a contract together with all its financial parameters (parties, dates, contract amount, method of payment, different special tax parameters, prices, and discounts). These parameters might be used as default values in all documents that are associated with a business transaction (sales orders, purchase orders, free text invoices, and journals).

  - Print the contract details in printed forms, such as invoices, payment orders, and invoices for payment.

  - Cross-verify mutual liabilities with the partner according to the contract, and generate an act of reconciliation with the partner.

  - Restrict customer/vendor transaction settlement to the transactions that are related to one contract.
