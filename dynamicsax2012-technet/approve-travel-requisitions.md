      - **Delegate** – Assign the travel requisition to another user to approve. For more information, see [Add delegates](add-delegates.md).
    
      - **Preview** – View a summary of the travel requisition.
    
      - **Mark as read** – Indicate that the travel requisition has been viewed.
    
      - **Open travel requisition** – Open the travel requisition to view more information.
    
      - **View history** – Open the **Workflow history details** page, where you can view the history and details of the travel requisition in the approval process.
