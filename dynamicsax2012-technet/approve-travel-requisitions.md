1.  Click **Approvals** on the top link bar, and then click **My approvals** on the Quick Launch.

2.  Select a travel requisition, and then on the **Actions** menu, click one of the following options:
    
      - **Approve** – Approve the entire travel requisition. If your company has opted to approve travel requisitions by line item instead of approving the entire document, a check box is displayed next to each transaction on the requisition. Select the check box next to each transaction that you want to approve.
    
      - **Return** – Return the travel requisition to the worker who submitted it. You might return a travel requisition if the information is incomplete or if you have questions about the requisition.
    
      - **Delegate** – Assign the travel requisition to another user to approve. For more information, see [Add delegates](add-delegates.md).
    
      - **Preview** – View a summary of the travel requisition.
    
      - **Mark as read** – Indicate that the travel requisition has been viewed.
    
      - **Open travel requisition** – Open the travel requisition to view more information.
    
      - **View history** – Open the **Workflow history details** page, where you can view the history and details of the travel requisition in the approval process. For more information, see [View the status and history of a document (Enterprise Portal)](view-the-status-and-history-of-a-document-enterprise-portal.md).
