# Specify inclusive or exclusive tax (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to set up inclusive taxes and exclusive taxes in Retail essentials. Inclusive taxes, for example value-added tax (VAT), are included in product prices. Exclusive taxes, for example sales taxes, are not included in product prices. You can specify settings for inclusive tax and exclusive tax for each customer. You can also specify settings for each store. When tax is calculated, the settings that are specified for a customer override the settings that are specified for a store.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Retail essentials, the form that you use to complete this task includes a subset of the controls that are available for other configurations of Retail. If a topic about this form describes controls that you don't see, it may be because youâ€™re using Retail essentials.</P>



To set up inclusive and exclusive taxes, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Retail essentials** \> **Channels** \> **Retail stores**.

2.  On the **Retail stores** list page, open the store to modify.

3.  In the **Stores** form, on the **General** FastTab, under **Sales tax**, select the **Prices include sales tax** check box if product prices in the store include taxes. Clear the check box if product prices in the store do not include taxes.
