# (RUS) Specify an inventory profile to report a finished BOM 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

When you create a bill of materials (BOM) journal to report a BOM as finished, the value of the **Inventory profile** field is specified on the BOM journal lines. The BOM journal lines correspond to the BOM lines as follows:

  - If the **Inventory profile** field is not active for the specified item, the dimension value is not specified.

  - If the **Inventory profile** field is specified on the BOM lines, the value of the **Inventory profile** field is specified on the BOM journal lines.

  - If the **Inventory profile** field is specified in the **Bills of materials** area in the **Inventory and warehouse management parameters** form, the specified value of the dimension inventory profile is entered on the BOM journal lines.
