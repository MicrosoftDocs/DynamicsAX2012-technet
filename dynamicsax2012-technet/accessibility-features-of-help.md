# Accessibility features of Help 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Microsoft Dynamics AX Help includes features that make it accessible to a variety of users, which includes those who have limited dexterity, low vision, or other disabilities.

## Customize accessibility settings in the Help viewer

The Microsoft Dynamics AX Help viewer opens when you select **Help** from the client Help menu, or when you press F1 to view Help for a form. The Help viewer is a modified version of Microsoft Internet Explorer. To change accessibility settings in the Help viewer, you must open Internet Explorer *separately* from the Help viewer and enter your preferences there. For more information, see [accessibility options](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=217525%26clcid=0x409) for the latest releases of Internet Explorer.

## Keyboard shortcuts for using the Help viewer

By using the keyboard shortcuts in Help, you can quickly perform many common tasks.

For a list of keyboard shortcuts for Microsoft Dynamics AX, including the Help viewer, see [Shortcut keys](shortcut-keys.md).

## Change the font size of a Help topic

To increase or decrease the font size of a Help topic, press the number pad plus or minus key while pressing the CTRL key.

## Use a web browser to view Help topics

Beginning in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, most of the Microsoft-distributed product Help is hosted on the web. As a result, clicking certain Help menu options and links will cause your preferred web browser to open and display a Help topic. Accessibility features vary from one browser to another. If you use Internet Explorer, refer to [accessibility options](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=217525%26clcid=0x409) for the latest Internet Explorer releases. If you use a non-Microsoft browser, consult the product Help for the browser that you use.
