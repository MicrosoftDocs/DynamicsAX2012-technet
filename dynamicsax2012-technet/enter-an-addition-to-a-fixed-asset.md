_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

An addition to a fixed asset is maintenance to or an add-on item for a fixed asset. An addition is considered part of a fixed asset, but is not a separate asset. For example, an extra battery for a laptop is an addition to the laptop fixed asset. Typically, an addition is maintenance or an improvement and is related to a write-up adjustment.
