# Answer questions in a configuration project in RapidStart Services 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Beginning October 1, 2015, RapidStart services will no longer be supported. For more information, see the announcement on CustomerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/northamerica/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued or PartnerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/news-events/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued.

Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services is an online tool that is used to collect information and records that are related to how an organization does business. This information is collected from various business experts in an organization by using interview-style questionnaires on the RapidStart Services website. Questions are answered by entering text in fields, selecting Yes or No options, and making selections in lists. Questions can also be answered by uploading Microsoft Excel workbooks that contain records that are related to your business, such as customer lists or sales tax rates.

As a business expert in a partner or customer organization, you may be asked to answer one or more groups of questions in a RapidStart Services configuration project. The answers that you and other business experts provide on the RapidStart Services website are used to set up your organization’s implementation of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. When you use RapidStart Services to select options and upload data, your organization doesn’t have to select options and upload data records one at a time in Microsoft Dynamics AX. As a result, you can begin using Microsoft Dynamics AX to conduct business as quickly as possible.

As a business expert who answers questions in RapidStart Services, you help your organization in two important ways:

  - By contributing your expert knowledge of the area of the business that you work in, you help guarantee that Microsoft Dynamics AX is set up to use the best options and data.

  - Because you and other business experts can answer questions on the RapidStart Services website at the same time, your organization can begin using Microsoft Dynamics AX faster than if just one or two people were setting up the product.

## How do I sign in to the RapidStart Services website?

An administrator in your organization associates your Microsoft account (formerly Windows Live ID) with your organization’s RapidStart Services configuration project. The administrator then notifies you that you have been assigned to answer questions in the configuration project.

Use the following procedure to sign in to the RapidStart Services website.

1.  In your browser, open online services for Microsoft Dynamics ERP at [http://www.dynamicsonline.com](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=141031).

2.  Click **For Customers**, and then click **Sign in**.

3.  Sign in by using the Microsoft account that is associated with your customer account in online services.

4.  If your Microsoft account is associated with more than one organization in RapidStart Services, on the **Choose your organization** page, click the name of the organization to work with.

5.  On the Customer Portal dashboard, click **Microsoft Dynamics® RapidStart**.

## How do I know which questions I should answer?

1.  After you sign in to online services, on the **Getting started** page, follow one of these steps:
    
      - In the left pane, click **Open existing project**.
    
      - In the main area, click **Open an existing project**.

2.  On the **Projects** page, click the row of the configuration project in which to answer questions, and then click the name of the project.
    
    The first page of questions that you have to answer is displayed. Each group of questions that has been assigned to you displays your name.

## How do I answer the different types of questions in RapidStart Services?

As a business expert, you may encounter four types of questions in RapidStart Services: Yes or No questions, text entry questions, list-selection questions, and Excel workbook uploads.

**Yes or No questions** – Select the **Yes** or **No** option. When you select **Yes** for some questions, an additional set of questions is displayed. For example, you select **Yes** in answer to the question “Do you want the customer's credit limit to be checked when sales orders, customer invoices, and electronic invoices are recorded?” In this case, more questions are displayed that let you select the method that is used to verify a customer’s credit limit and the type of notification that is displayed in Microsoft Dynamics AX when a credit limit is exceeded.

**Text entry questions** – Enter information in a text field. For example, if you are entering basic information about your organization, you enter the organization’s name and address in text fields.

**List-selection questions** – Select among the available options in a drop-down list. For example, to specify the type of financial period that your organization uses, you select one of the following options in a list: **Day**, **Month**, or **Year**.

**Excel workbook uploads** – Download an Excel template, enter the appropriate data into the workbook, save the file, and then upload the completed workbook into your RapidStart Services project.  

![RapidStart Services Excel Question Example](images/Dn193998.RapidStartExcelQuestionExample(AX.60).gif "RapidStart Services Excel Question Example")

  
For example, for the question “Define the aging period definitions and aging periods that will be used to age documents,” you click the **Download template** link next to the question and save the Excel file to your computer.

You then open the Excel file and enter your organization’s aging definitions and periods.

Finally, you save the file on your computer, click the **Upload workbook** link next to the question text, and then select the completed file that you saved on your computer.

## How do I get more information to help me understand a question?

Tooltips provide more information about many of the questions that are presented to business experts in RapidStart Services. To view the tooltip for a question, point to the question text.

When you have finished working on a page of questions, click **Save** at the top of the page.
