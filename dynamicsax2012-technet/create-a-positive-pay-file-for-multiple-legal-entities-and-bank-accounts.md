# Create a positive pay file for multiple legal entities and bank accounts 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

This topic explains how to generate a positive pay file for multiple legal entities and bank accounts, confirm a positive pay file, and recall a positive pay file.

You can use positive pay to generate an electronic list of checks that is provided to the bank. When the check is presented to the bank, the bank compares the check with the list of checks. If the check matches what the bank has on file in the list, the bank clears the check. If there is a difference, the bank holds the check for review.

For information about creating, confirming and recalling positive pay files for payroll, see [Issue worker payments](issue-worker-payments.md).

## 1\. Generate a positive pay file for multiple legal entities and bank accounts

You can generate a positive pay file for a single legal entity and a single bank account by using the **Bank accounts** form. For more information, see [Generate and print vendor checks](generate-and-print-vendor-checks.md). To generate positive pay files for multiple legal entities and bank accounts at the same time, use the information in this procedure, instead.

To generate a positive pay file for multiple legal entities and bank accounts, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Cash and bank management** \> **Periodic** \> **Positive pay file**.

2.  Select the positive pay format for the file.

3.  Select whether to generate the positive pay file for all legal entities or for a selected legal entity. If necessary, select a legal entity.

4.  Select whether to generate the positive pay file for all bank accounts that use the format that you specified in step 2, or for a selected bank account. If necessary, select a bank account. If you select all bank accounts, it is possible that only one positive pay file will be generated. In most cases, it is best to generate positive pay files for one bank account at a time if multiple bank accounts share the same positive pay format.

5.  In the **Cut-off date** field, enter the last check date to include in the positive pay file. All checks that havenâ€™t been included in a positive pay file through this check date are included in the file.

6.  Click **OK**.

## 2\. Confirm a positive pay file

After the checks that are listed in a positive pay file have been paid, you receive a confirmation number from your bank. Then, you can confirm the positive pay file in Microsoft Dynamics AX. Confirming a positive pay file records the confirmation number that you receive from the bank.

To confirm a positive pay file, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Cash and bank management** \> **Inquiries** \> **Positive pay file summary**.

2.  Select a positive pay file that has a status of **Created**.

3.  Click **Confirmation**.

4.  Enter the confirmation number that you received from the bank.

5.  Click **OK**.

## 3\. If required: Recall a positive pay file

If you have to change a positive pay file, you can recall it. Recalling a positive pay file resets the field for each check that indicates whether the check has been included in a positive pay file. Then, you can create a new positive pay file that includes the check that was recalled.

To recall a positive pay file, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Cash and bank management** \> **Inquiries** \> **Positive pay file summary**.

2.  Select a positive pay file that has a status of **Created**.

3.  Click **Recall**. A message confirms that the recall process was successful.
