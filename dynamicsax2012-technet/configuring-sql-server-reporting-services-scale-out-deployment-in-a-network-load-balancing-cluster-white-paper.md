# Configuring SQL Server Reporting Services scale-out deployment in a Network Load Balancing cluster (White paper) [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This white paper explains how to configure a Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services scale-out deployment to run in a Network Load Balancing (NLB) cluster.

A Reporting Services scale-out deployment includes two or more report server instances that share a single report server database. By using a scale-out deployment, you can increase the number of users who can access reports at the same time and improve the availability of the report server.
