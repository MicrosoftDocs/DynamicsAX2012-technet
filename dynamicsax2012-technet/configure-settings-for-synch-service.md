# Configure settings for Synch Service 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

This topic describes how to use the Synch Service Settings wizard to manage Commerce Data Exchange: Synch Service. You must have administrative credentials to open the Synch Service Settings wizard.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Synch Service is required for Retail only in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 and Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack. In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, this component is used only to support previous versions of Retail POS while you upgrade (N-1).</P>



1.  Click **Start** \> **All Programs** \> **Microsoft Dynamics AX** \> **Commerce Data Exchange** \> **Synch Service** \> **Service Settings** to open the wizard.

2.  To register an instance of Synch Service, type the name of the instance in the **Server name** field, and then click **Add**. By default, the local computer name is displayed. This step associates the instance of Synch Service with the local message database.
    
    To manage an existing instance, select the instance in the **All Servers** list. You can also start or stop an instance on this page.
    

    > [!TIP]
    > <P>To prevent confusion, use a unique name for each instance of Synch Service in the organization.</P>

    
    Click **Next**.

3.  On the **Service properties** page, enter the following information, or accept the default settings.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><p>Option</p></th>
    <th><p>Description</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Packet Owner</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>If you select <strong>2nd Stage Synch Service</strong> in the <strong>Server mode</strong> field, specify the server where packages originate.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Server mode</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>In most cases, you should select <strong>Synch Service</strong>. However, if the selected instance of Synch Service is a forwarder, select <strong>2nd Stage Synch Service</strong>.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Server port</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the listening port for Synch Service. This setting is not available for a forwarder instance, because in that case, the service only forwards packages. If you plan to run more than one instance of the service on the same computer, you must change the port values so that they do not conflict with other services.</p>
    <p>Use the <strong>Off</strong> button to turn the server listening port on or off. We do not recommend that you turn the port off.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Telnet port</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the port that is used by the Synch Service Telnet interface. This feature lets you use Telnet to monitor the status of Synch Service. If you also run a Telnet server on the computer, assign the Synch Service interface to another port to conflicts.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    
    Click **Next**.

4.  On the **Synch Service specific properties** page, enter the following information, or accept the default settings.

    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Days Messages Exist</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the number of days to keep incoming or outgoing messages that have been processed. If you type a value of <strong>0</strong> in this field, messages are not deleted.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Timer Interval</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the interval at which Synch Service checks for packages that must be reprocessed.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Limit Job Process (cnt)</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the maximum number of job records that Synch Service processes per connection. You should set this field to a lower value when the average package size is high, and to a higher value when the average package size is low. To disable the feature, enter a value of <strong>0</strong>. We do not recommend that you disable this feature.</p>
    <p>This feature ensures that Synch Service continues to process job records, even if it has a heavy load that might typically cause it to stop responding. Additionally, when this feature is on, if the first job record in the batch has an error, the remaining packages are skipped for the run.</p></td>
    </tr>

    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Socket Timeout</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the number of seconds that Synch Service waits for the network to finish a particular send or receive operation.

Therefore, if the service has been set to automatically restart when a failure occurs, the failure appears in the old log files.</p></td>

    <tr class="even">

    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Error</strong> – All errors that are reported from Synch Service are logged.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Main</strong> – The main operations in Synch Service are logged.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Detail</strong> – Very detailed information about operations in Synch Service is logged.</p></li>

    Click **Finish**. To configure another instance of Synch Service, select the instance in the **All Servers** list, and then repeat the steps in this procedure.

7.  When the configuration is completed, close the wizard.

8.  On a Microsoft Dynamics AX client computer, modify the Application Object Server (AOS) profile so that it uses this instance of Synch Service. For more information, see [Set up an AOS profile](set-up-an-aos-profile.md).
