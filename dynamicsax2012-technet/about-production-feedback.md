# About production feedback 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When workers register time and item consumption on production jobs that have been set up to use Time and attendance, the registrations are posted on the relevant production order.

You can update operation quantity and status feedback when a worker has completed a production job, or when a process job is underway. Providing feedback regularly throughout the production process helps to improve inventory and production management.

In the **Report as finished** field group in the **Production parameters** form, you can specify how a production order should be updated when the last job of the production order is reported as finished in Production control.

For each type of registration form in the **Configure registration forms** form, you can specify whether workers must report produced quantity on production jobs in progress every time that they clock out. To open the **Configure registration forms** form: Click **Human resources** \> **Setup** \> **Time and attendance** \> **Terminals** \> **Configure registration forms**.

Also, you can select the layout of the feedback form that will be used in a registration form configuration:

  - Grid – All the production jobs started by a worker are displayed in a list.

  - Wizard – If a worker has started more than one job, the jobs are displayed individually in the wizard.
