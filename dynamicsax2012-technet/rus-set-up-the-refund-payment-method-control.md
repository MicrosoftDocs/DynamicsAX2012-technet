3.  On the **Permissions** FastTab, select the **Allow refunds using different methods** check box to allow the return of items using payment methods other than the one that was used in the original transaction.

4.  Close the **Permission groups** form.

5.  Click **Retail** \> **Common** \> **Workers**.

6.  Select a worker, and then on the **Action Pane**, on the **Retail** tab, in the **Set up** group, click **POS permissions**.

7.  Select the **Override permissions** check box to override the permissions for the worker.

8.  In the **POS permission group** field, select the permission group that you created.
