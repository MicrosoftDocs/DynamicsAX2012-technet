## Director: Assign invoice lines to mandats

When a vendor invoice is received, the director approves or certifies that the goods or services were received and gathers the necessary supporting documentation. Once everything is in order, the director assigns each invoice line to a mandat.

For certain expenses, the accountant may make a payment before receiving a mandat, and the director will regularize the payment by issuing a mandat afterward. This usually occurs for urgent or recurrent expenses, such as utility payments or rent. It may also occur when money is owed to a régisseur.

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Reports** \> **France** \> **Mandat de paiement**.

2.  To retrieve invoices that have not yet been paid, in the **Invoice status** group, click **Pending**.
    
    –or–
    
    To retrieve invoices that have already been paid, in the **Invoice status** group, click **Posted**.
    

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > <P>Lines from invoices that are being edited will not be retrieved.</P>



3.  In the **From date** field, enter the first date in the range of dates that you want to select invoices from. In the **To date** field, enter the last date in the range of dates. Invoices that were created within this range will be reviewed to determine whether they meet the selected criteria.

4.  Click **Retrieve lines** to open a database inquiry form.

5.  On the inquiry form, enter the criteria to find the vendor invoices that you want to assign to mandats. In most cases, you will select a single vendor account for the **Invoice accounts** field, and leave the remaining criteria blank.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>To find the invoice lines from mandats that were rejected by the accountant, select <STRONG>Not reviewed</STRONG> for the <STRONG>Director authorization status</STRONG> and <STRONG>Rejected</STRONG> for the <STRONG>Accountant acceptance status</STRONG>. Do not enter a mandat number. The mandat number and bordereau de mandat number are removed when the accountant rejects the mandat.</P>



6.  Click **OK** to close the inquiry form. All invoice lines that match the invoice status, dates, and selection criteria that you entered will appear in the grid.
