# (NOR) Set up and maintain payment IDs 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A payment identification (ID) is a unique identifier for customer payments that are settled electronically. It can be divided into different parts, such as the customer account number, invoice number, prefix, suffix, and external reference. When you receive a payment from a customer, the payment ID identifies the payment transaction for a sales invoice that is received from a bank.

## Set up payment IDs

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Payment** \> **Payment ID**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a new payment ID.

3.  In the **Payment ID type** field, enter a code for the payment ID, and then in the **Name** field, enter a descriptive name for the payment ID.

4.  In the **Payment ID length** field, enter the length of the payment ID.

5.  In the **Modulo** field, select the modulo check method to calculate the check number. The last digit of a payment ID is reserved for the check number to verify that the payment ID is valid. The following options are available:
    
      - **Modulo 10** – The total length of the payment ID is divided by 10. The remainder is the check number.
    
      - **Modulo 11** – The total length of the payment ID is divided by 11. The remainder is the check number.
    
      - **(None)** – No check number is calculated.

6.  In the **Account from position** field, enter the starting position for the customer or vendor account number in the payment ID.

7.  In the **Account to position** field, enter the ending position for the customer or vendor account number in the payment ID.

8.  In the **Invoice from position** field, enter the starting position for the invoice number in the payment ID.

9.  In the **Invoice to position** field, enter the ending position for the invoice number in the payment ID.

10. Click the **General** tab, and then in the **Prefix** field group, specify the prefix information for the payment ID.

11. In the **Suffix** field group, specify the suffix information for the payment ID.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Prefix and suffix text values are not included when the check number is calculated.</P>



12. In the **External reference** field group, enter the starting and ending positions for the external reference of the payment ID. The external reference is the account number of a vendor who is also a customer.

13. In the **Text** field group, specify the prefix text value and suffix text value for the payment ID.

14. Click the **Setup** tab, and then select the **Blank payment ID** check box to issue a payment slip without the payment ID.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can preview the selected payment ID in the <STRONG>Payment ID test</STRONG> field.</P>
