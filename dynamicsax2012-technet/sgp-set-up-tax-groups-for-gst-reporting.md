# (SGP) Set up tax groups for GST reporting 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use the **Sales tax groups** form to set up sales tax groups. The sales tax groups are assigned to companies, and taxes are calculated based on the tax codes that are in effect when transactions occur. For Singapore, set up at least the following three tax groups:

  - **GST** – Use this group for companies that are subject to standard tax.

  - **Exempt** – Use this group for companies that provide certain financial services or the sale and lease of residential properties. Sales tax is not charged for these types of supplies.

  - **Zero-rated** – Use this group for companies that have special trade agreements. The export of goods and the provision of international services are zero-rated supplies.

<!-- end list -->
