_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can stop payment on a postdated check issued to a vendor for reasons such as insufficient funds, change in the terms of the agreement with the vendor, supply of defective goods by the vendor, or return of goods to the vendor. You can stop payment only on checks that have not cleared.

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Journals** \> **Payments** \> **Payment journal**.

2.  Select a payment journal, and then click **Lines**.

3.  Select a payment journal line for which a postdated check is registered, and then click the **Postdated checks** tab.

4.  Select the **Stop payment** check box to stop payment on the postdated check. The status of the check is updated to **On hold** in the **Postdated check status** field.

5.  In the **Reason for stopping payment** field, specify a reason to stop the payment to the vendor.

6.  Close the forms to save your changes.
