# About gift cards in AX 2012 R3 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic discusses functionality that has been added for gift cards in Retail in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3. In Retail, you can create gift cards that can be issued at one store and redeemed at any store in the organization. Retail keeps track of gift card balances, so a card can be reused until its available balance reaches zero. Funds can also be added to an existing gift card at any time. Gift cards in AX 2012 R3 offer additional options that aren’t available in earlier versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX.

## New functionality for gift cards in Retail in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3

In Retail in AX 2012 R3, the following functionality was added for gift cards:

  - **Support for electronic gift cards**. In addition to supporting the sale and redemption of physical gift cards, Retail in AX 2012 R3 lets you sell electronic gift cards in the online store and the call center. Customers can redeem electronic gift cards in any channel. To issue electronic gift cards, you must set up the gift card number template in the **Retail parameters** form. When the sales order for the electronic gift card is invoiced, the gift card number is generated and sent in an email message to the gift card recipient.

  - **More options for adding funds to gift cards**. In previous releases, you could add funds to gift cards only through the point of sale. Now, you can also add funds to gift cards that are issued from the call center.

  - **The ability to void unused gift cards.** When a gift card is issued in error, you can void the gift card, if it hasn’t been used in a transaction.

  - **Support for cross-company gift cards**. Gift cards can be sold and accepted by retail stores across legal entities. In this scenario, one legal entity in an organization holds the liability balance for gift cards and other legal entities transfer the value of their gift card sales and redemptions to that legal entity.
    
    If your organization supports intercompany transactions, you can set up one company as the parent company. This company can hold the liability for all gift card sales from all stores that are participating in the gift card program. The other stores can be assigned to a different legal entity, but must roll up to the parent company’s legal entity for the purpose of retail gift card sales. When gift cards are sold or redeemed, the liability is increased or decreased accordingly in the parent company based on intercompany posting rules. When the gift card is invoiced, the gift card liability is increased for the parent company. When payments are made with the gift card, the gift card liability is decreased for the parent company.

## Setting up gift cards in AX 2012 R3
