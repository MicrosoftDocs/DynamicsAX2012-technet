# Deploy an Enterprise Portal site that uses AD FS authentication 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic describes how to deploy Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX in an Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) environment. AD FS simplifies access to systems and applications by using a claims-based authorization mechanism to help maintain application security. AD FS supports web single sign-on technologies that help IT organizations collaborate across organizational boundaries. AD FS is a server role in Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2012. For more information about AD FS, see [Active Directory Federation Services](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=389356).

This topic includes the following sections.

  - Before you begin

  - Pre-installation tasks

  - Install Enterprise Portal binaries

  - Enable SharePoint Claims to Windows Token Service

  - Create a claims-aware Enterprise Portal site

  - Register an SSL certificate on the AD FS server

  - Install Active Directory Federation Services 2.0

  - Add a trusted relying party

  - Manage the AD FS token-signing certificate

  - Specify the claims provider in SharePoint

  - Register the AD FS signing certificate as a trusted root authority with SharePoint

  - Create a new user for AD FS authentication

  - Assign security roles for users

  - Validate AD FS configurations

  - Troubleshooting AD FS issues

  - Specify which trusted identity provider is available for users at logon

## Before you begin

## Register an SSL certificate on the AD FS server

For testing, you can create a self-signed SSL certificate. If you create self-signed certificates, we recommend that you have one self-signed SSL certificate for the Enterprise Portal server (SSLCert1) and one self-signed SSL certificate for the AD FS server (SSLCert2). For more information, see [Create a Self-Signed Server Certificate in IIS 7.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=235235). For production servers, you must register an SSL certificate from a certification authority on the AD FS server. The certificate will help make sure that the user’s claim was not changed in transit. We recommend that you register separate SSL certificates for the AD FS and Enterprise Portal servers. After you have created self-signed certificates or acquired certificates, complete the following procedure.

1.  On the Windows Server that will host the claims-based Enterprise Portal site, click **Start** \> **Run**, type **mmc**, and then click **OK**.

2.  Click **File** \> **Add/remove snap-in**.

3.  Click **Certificates**, and then click **Add**.

4.  When the system prompts you to specify which type of account to manage certificates for, click **Computer Account**, and then click **Next**.

5.  Click **Local computer**, and then click **Finish**.

6.  In the **Add or Remove Snap-ins** dialog box, click **OK**.

7.  In MMC snap-in, click the **Certificates (Local Computer)** node.

8.  Right-click **Personal**, and then click **All tasks** \> **Import**. The Certificate Import Wizard opens. Click **Next**.

9.  Browse to the certificate, and then click **Next**.

10. Enter the password for the certificate, and then click **Next**.

11. Select the **Mark this key as exportable** option, and then click **Next**. The **Certificate Store** dialog box appears.

12. Click **Next**.

13. Click **Finish**.

## Enable SharePoint Claims to Windows Token Service

You must enable the SharePoint claims to Windows token service (C2WTS) for claims-based authentication. Use the following procedure to start this service.

1.  In SharePoint Central Administration, under **System Settings**, click **Manage services on server**.

2.  Locate the Claims to Windows Token Service.

3.  In the **Action** column, click **Start**.

4.  In Windows, click **Start** \> **Run**, type **services.msc** and press Enter.

5.  In the **Services** console, verify that the **Claims to Windows Token Service** is running.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Do not use the services.msc to start the C2WTS because the service will be automatically disabled after a period of time. You must use SharePoint Central Administration to start this service.</P>



## Create a claims-aware Enterprise Portal site

This section describes how to create a claims-aware Enterprise Portal site by using a Microsoft Windows PowerShell cmdlet. The cmdlet in this section first creates a claims-aware web application in SharePoint, and then deploys an Enterprise Portal site on that web application. If you are not familiar with Windows PowerShell cmdlets for Microsoft Dynamics AX, see [Administering Microsoft Dynamics AX by using Windows PowerShell](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=235298) for more information. You can also create a claims-aware Enterprise Portal site on an existing SharePoint web application. Complete one of the following procedures.

  - Create a claims-aware site on a new SharePoint web application

  - Create a claims-aware site on an existing SharePoint web application

## Create a claims-aware site on a new SharePoint web application


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Windows PowerShell includes a security setting called the execution policy that determines how scripts are run. By default, the execution policy is set to <STRONG>Restricted</STRONG>, which prevents any scripts from running. To run the installation scripts for Microsoft Dynamics AX components, we recommend that you set the execution policy to <STRONG>RemoteSigned</STRONG> by using Set-ExecutionPolicy cmdlet. This setting allows you to run scripts that you’ve written and scripts that have been signed by a trusted publisher.</P>



1.  Open the Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Management Shell with administrator privileges. Click **Start** \> **Administrative Tools** \> right-click **Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Management Shell** and click **Run as administrator**.

2.  Enter the following command and press Enter.
    
    $Cred=Get-Credential

3.  When prompted, enter the credentials for the .NET Business Connector proxy account. The credentials must be the .NET Business Connector proxy account and password that were specified when Enterprise Portal binaries were installed earlier in this document. If you specify an account other than the .NET Business Connector proxy account, then the cmdlet overwrites the existing .NET Business Connector account, which can cause existing Enterprise Portal installations to stop working. Also note, this cmdlet designates the .NET Business Connector proxy account as the Enterprise Portal site administrator.

4.  Execute the following command, replacing “PathToSSLCert1” with the path to *SSLCert1*, which you imported earlier in this document.
    
    $SSLCert = Get-PfxCertificate "PathToSSLCert1"
    
    When prompted, enter the password that you specified when you exported the SSL certificate.

5.  On the Enterprise Portal server, execute the **New-AXClaimsAwareEnterprisePortalServer** cmdlet. For descriptions of the required parameters and syntax, see [New-AXClaimsAwareEnterprisePortalServer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=217573) on TechNet.
    
    The following example shows the cmdlet with the required parameters. Note that the port value of 8000 is a user-defined value. You can specify any available port number. If you specify port 443, then you do not need to specify the port number when you type the web site URL.
    
    new-AXClaimsAwareEnterprisePortalServer -Credential $Cred -Port 8000 -SSLCertificate $SSLCert
    
    This cmdlet can take several minutes to be completed. After the cmdlet is completed, you can access a new instance of Enterprise Portal at the following URL: https://*ServerName*:*PortNumber*/sites/DynamicsAx.

Browse this site to verify that the command was executed properly. If you viewed the site, then you skip to the section titled “Install Active Directory Federation Services 2.0” in this topic. If you were not able to view the site, see the section titled “Troubleshooting issues with a claims-aware site”.

## Create a claims-aware site on an existing SharePoint web application

If you want to create a new claims-aware site on an existing SharePoint web application, note the following requirements.

  - The web application must be configured for Integrated Windows/NTLM authentication in SharePoint Central Administration. This is required even if the web application is already configured as a claims-mode web application.

  - You must be a member of the site collection administrator group in SharePoint to perform the following procedures.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> <P>We recommend that the web application be configured with SSL to enhance data security.</P>

    The following example shows the cmdlet with the required parameters. AXUser, UserName, and UserDomain are user-specified values. The value of UserDomain is the same value that you specified in Step 4 of the “Specify the Claims Provider in SharePoint” procedure earlier in this document.
    
    New-AXUser -AccountType ClaimsUser -AXUserId april -UserName aprilbuckley -UserDomain ADFSProvider

## Assign security roles for users

You must assign security roles for each user who was created by using the New-AXUser cmdlet. For information about how to assign security roles in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client, see [Assign users to security roles](assign-users-to-security-roles.md). For information about how to assign security roles by using PowerShell, see the [Add-AXSecurityRoleMember](add-axsecurityrolemember.md) cmdlet Help on TechNet.

## Validate AD FS configurations

1.  Open a web browser, and browse the Enterprise Portal site: https://*ServerName*:*PortNumber*/sites/DynamicsAx

2.  In the list of providers, select the AD FS provider. For example, **ADFSProvider**.

3.  Log on to Enterprise Portal by using the credentials that you created in the previous procedure. You should be able to log on to Microsoft Dynamics AX as a system user.

## Troubleshooting AD FS issues

_**Error: Users see a blank page after logging on to Enterprise Portal by using the AD FS provider.**_

This error occurs when the logon URL for the AD FS provider (for example, https://TestServer.contoso.com/adfs/ls/) cannot be opened in a web browser. To resolve this issue, you must update the hosts file on the server.
