# What's new: Accounts payable features 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

We have changed and added functionality in the [Accounts payable](accounts-payable.md) area for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. For more information, see the tables that apply to your version of the product.

<td><p>The sign of the invoice quantity must match the sign of the ordered quantity.</p></td>
<td><p>The sign of the invoice quantity on a vendor invoice must match the sign of the ordered quantity on the purchase order. In earlier versions, you could enter a negative invoice quantity to record the return of a product. To provide better accounting control, this functionality is no longer available. Instead, you can issue a credit note for the purchase order line as a separate purchase order line. In other words, you can enter a purchase order line that has a negative quantity.</p>

<td><p>A unit price that is based on an inventory cost price is updated only one time for a customer invoice.</p></td>
<td><p>The unit price on an intercompany purchase order and an intercompany sales order is updated for changes only when the first customer invoice for the intercompany sales order is entered. The update occurs only if the unit cost price is changed in Inventory management, and this update occurs automatically. If a subsequent customer invoice is entered, the unit price for that customer invoice does not come from the cost of the item. Instead, the unit price comes from the intercompany purchase order.</p>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Changes to the Accounts payable invoice table</p></td>
<td><p>In earlier versions, unposted purchase order invoices that were entered in the <strong>Posting invoice</strong> form were stored in the same tables as information about updating purchase orders, receipts lists, and packing slips. In this version, unposted purchase order invoices, which are now known as vendor invoices, are stored in a separate set of tables.</p>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Changes to invoice matching for line items that are identified by descriptions and categories</p></td>
<td><p>You can match an invoice line that is identified by a description and a category to a corresponding purchase order line and product receipt line. This feature is based on the functionality that you use to enter lines that are identified by a description and a category on a purchase order, product receipt, and invoice. Additionally, you can use this feature together with purchasing policies that are assigned to line items that are identified by descriptions and categories.</p>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Create vendor invoices and credit notes from electronic invoices.</p></td>
<td><p>A new service for Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Integration Framework (AIF), VendVendInvoiceService, creates vendor invoices and credit notes from invoices that are received electronically. The service also lets vendors request and retrieve unposted invoice information in Accounts payable.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="about-integration-ports-for-vendor-invoices.md">About integration ports for vendor invoices</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>In the <strong>Vendor invoice</strong> form, enter vendor invoice lines that are not related to a purchase order.</p></td>
<td><p>You can enter vendor invoice lines in the <strong>Vendor invoice</strong> form, even if the lines are not related to a purchase order. The same vendor invoice can include a combination of lines that are related to purchase orders and lines that are not related to purchase orders. The following lines are examples of vendor invoice lines that are not related to a purchase order:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Subscription dues</p></li>
<li><p>Conference event registrations</p></li>
<li><p>Catering services</p></li>
<li><p>Cleaning services</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can enter vendor invoice lines that are not related to a purchase order and do not create inventory transactions. However, inventoried or stocked lines are not supported on vendor invoice lines that are not related to a purchase order.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="key-tasks-vendor-invoices.md">Key tasks: Vendor invoices</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Invoice matching: Price total matching</p></td>
<td><p>If the parameter that enables price total matching in the <strong>Accounts payable parameters</strong> form is selected, the net amount of an invoice line plus the net amount of any pending invoice lines and previously posted invoice lines is compared with the purchase order line. If the variance amount in the accounting currency exceeds the tolerance percentage, amount, or percentage and amount for price total matching, the user receives a message that warns about a matching discrepancy. This type of variance can occur when partial invoices individually meet quantity and price tolerances, but when these invoices are combined, they exceed a specified percentage or currency value that is defined by the legal entity. Tolerances for price total matching can be set up per legal entity.</p>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Invoice matching: Enhancements to charge matching</p></td>
<td><p>If the option to use charges matching is selected in the <strong>Accounts payable parameters</strong> form, charges on a vendor invoice can be compared with the expected charges from the purchase order. If the variance exceeds the tolerance percentage for charges, an indicator is displayed to warn the user about the matching discrepancy. Charge tolerances can be set up per company or for individual charges codes.</p>

<tr class="even">
<td><p>Workflow for vendor invoice processing</p></td>
<td><p>By using two new workflow types, <strong>VendProcessInvoice</strong> and <strong>VendProcessInvoiceLine</strong>, users can create user-defined workflows for vendor invoices that are typically entered in the <strong>Vendor invoice</strong> form and other forms that use the InvoiceInfo* tables as the data source. The workflow process operates on data that is imported into the InvoiceInfo* tables, and can be used to model the processing steps for the vendor invoices. The workflow types contain the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Approval elements for creating approval tasks</p></li>
<li><p>A task element that is used when vendor invoices are completed and corrected</p></li>
<li><p>Automated tasks that can be run programmatically without user intervention to perform selected validations and post the vendor invoices.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Validations of vendor invoice, such as matching, are performed programmatically when the workflow is run. The validations use the settings of relevant Accounts payable parameters. Security is used to determine the behavior that is supported while an active workflow instance is associated with the vendor invoice. The standard workflow infrastructure in Microsoft Dynamics AX that lets a user create workflows, that determines the run-time behavior of the associated workflow instances, and that creates workflow history is used.</p>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Invoice matching: Two-way and three-way line matching policy</p></td>
<td><p>The line matching policy can be set up as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Three-way</strong> – Matching compares the invoice, purchase order, and product receipt.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Two-way</strong> – Matching compares the invoice and purchase order.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not required</strong> – Unit price matching and price totals matching are not performed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The line matching policy can be set up per legal entity, and also for items, vendors, or combinations of items and vendors.</p>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Invoice matching task for workflow</p></td>
<td><p>Invoice matching is now available as a workflow task that can be performed without user intervention. The workflow can be started based on a business event in Microsoft Dynamics AX. For example, the workflow can be started when new records are created by using the vendor invoice service. Vendor portal scenarios and import scenarios in which vendor invoices are processed without user intervention are supported. In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, invoice matching was performed automatically through the user interface when an invoice was created, modified, or retrieved. The new tasks use the same underlying logic that the user interface uses to perform invoice matching.</p>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>In the <strong>Vendor invoice</strong> form, enter vendor invoices that are not for a purchase order.</p></td>
<td><p>Invoice header fields have been added to the <strong>Vendor invoice</strong> form, so that you can use this form to enter a category-based invoice line that is not related to a purchase order.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="key-tasks-vendor-invoices.md">Key tasks: Vendor invoices</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Postdated checks</p></td>
<td><p>You can issue and receive checks that have a check date in the future. These checks are also known as postdated checks. Postdated checks are used as a common business practice in Asia, Africa, and many other parts of the world. Many businesses use checks as the primary way to make and receive payments.</p>
<p>You can create postdated checks in payment journals in both Accounts receivable and Accounts payable. Postdated checks use standard functionality in Microsoft Dynamics AX, such as payment journals, financial dimensions, check printing, centralized payments, settlements, and banking.</p>
<p>Postdated checks are not considered legal in certain parts of the world, such as Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Zealand, but are sometimes still used as a business practice in those countries/regions. To support this business practice but still comply with applicable laws, you can choose whether the check amount is reflected in your accounting books until the maturity date of the check is reached. If financial posting for postdated checks is turned off, the checks are documented for record-keeping purposes, and the financial transaction occurs only when the maturity date of the check is reached.</p>

<td><p>When you have to pay a vendor before goods are delivered or a service is performed, you can create a vendor invoice line that includes a category and the amount that must be paid in advance. You can validate the amount of the advance payment that is listed on the vendor invoice against the amount that is listed on the purchase order. You can also apply the vendor invoice for the advance payment against the vendor invoice for the items or service.</p>

<td><p>Integrate a payment calendar to control due dates for payments.</p></td>
<td><p>New functionality for a payment calendar in the Accounts receivable and Accounts payable areas replaces similar functionality that was previously available only for certain countries/regions. When the payment calendar is used together with rules for due dates, companies can specify non-business days for countries and regions, and additional holidays at the state and province levels. Companies can also specify non-business days for any other purpose, such as non-banking days. This functionality helps guarantee that due dates for payments on vendor and customer invoices are not set for non-business days. When a payment is due on a non-business day, the new due date control moves the date to the nearest business day either before or after the default date, based on options that you select.</p>
<p>You can also use the due date control together with the payment calendar to make sure that calculations of grace periods for interest and fees for payments start on the nearest business day. This functionality can be used, for example, to enhance the due date and payment date control in Accounts payable. You can then avoid any unplanned interest or fees for late vendor payments. Additionally, payment processing is easier, because due dates are always on a processing day.</p>
