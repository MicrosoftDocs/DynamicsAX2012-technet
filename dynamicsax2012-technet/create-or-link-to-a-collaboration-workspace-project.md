Collaboration workspaces provide members of a team with the ability to work on a project in a shared online space. Team members can share documents, create lists, and use other Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 features. Use the **Create collaboration workspace** form to set up a new shared workspace for a project or the **Link collaboration workspace** form to associate a project with an existing workspace.

Collaboration workspaces are built on Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 and SharePoint Server 2010 or on Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007.
