# Maintain employee injury and illness information 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

An occupational injury is an injury, such as a cut, fracture, burn, sprain, or amputation that results from a work-related accident or exposure to dangerous conditions that involves a single incident in the work environment. An occupational illness is a medical condition or disorder, other than one that is the result of an injury, caused by exposure to environmental factors associated with employment.

Your company can use the information about worker injuries and illnesses to develop a comprehensive safety and help plan. By analyzing and reviewing the information in injury and illness records, your company can identify potential safety hazards and take precautionary steps to prevent additional injuries and illnesses. Also, depending on your country/region, your legal entity might be required to record workplace injury and illness information for liability, legal, and insurance reasons.
