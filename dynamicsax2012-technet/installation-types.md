# Installation types 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Two types of installation are available from the Setup wizard: **Custom installation** and **Single-computer installation**.

## Custom installation

Select **Custom installation** to install specific Microsoft Dynamics AX components on multiple computers. Use this type of installation in a production environment.

## Single-computer installation

Select **Single-computer installation** to install a complete Microsoft Dynamics AX system on one computer. Setup uses default settings to configure all components, and new Microsoft Dynamics AX databases are created. User names and passwords are the only input that is required.

If you want to connect to an existing database or specify other custom settings, you must perform a custom installation.
