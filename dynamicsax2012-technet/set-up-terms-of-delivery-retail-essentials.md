This topic explains how to set up terms of delivery in Retail essentials. The terms of delivery specify the conditions for an item's transfer from seller to buyer. They are used on sales orders and purchases orders. You can specify the terms of delivery that are used by the organization for customers and vendors.

To set up terms of delivery, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Retail essentials** \> **Inventory management** \> **Setup** \> **Terms of delivery**.

2.  In the **Terms of delivery** form, click **New** to create a new delivery term.

3.  In the **Delivery terms** field, enter a short name for the delivery term.

4.  In the **Description** field, enter a full description of the current delivery term. This description appears on printed forms such as sales orders and customer invoices.

5.  On the **General** FastTab, enter the sales tax address and Intrastat codes, if applicable, of the selected terms of delivery.

6.  On the **Setup** FastTab, enter information about freight charges for the selected version of terms of delivery. This information is used when information is transferred from shipping carrier software to sales order invoices.

7.  On the **Transportation management** FastTab, select whether to add freight charges to orders, and whether added freight charges are collected on delivery (COD).
