_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

<td><p>In AX 2009, the <strong>Load on inventory %</strong> field is a country-specific feature for India. This field lets users to split the miscellaneous charges that are added to an invoice between inventory and the vendor or customer. Foundational changes that were made for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 made this country-specific option redundant.</p></td>

<td><p>Yes. In AX 2012, users can create two standard charge codes to achieve the same business impact. When creating charge codes on the <strong>Charges code</strong> form, users can set up one charge code that has the <strong>Debit</strong> <strong>Type</strong> field set to <strong>Item</strong> and another charge that has <strong>Debit</strong> <strong>Type</strong> set to <strong>Customer/Vendor</strong>. When users create the invoice, they can split the miscellaneous charge amount between these two charge codes. The <strong>Allocate charges</strong> form lets users divide the amount that is charged to the item, customer, or vendor, based on the percentage that is specified. For example, a charge that has <strong>Debit</strong> <strong>Type</strong> set to <strong>Item</strong> receives 10 percent, and a charge that has <strong>Debit</strong> <strong>Type</strong> set to <strong>Customer/Vendor</strong> receives 90 percent.</p>
