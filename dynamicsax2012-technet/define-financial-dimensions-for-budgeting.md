# Define financial dimensions for Budgeting 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use the **Budgeting dimensions** form to specify which financial dimensions in the account structures that are associated with the chart of accounts are available for Budgeting.

Some organizations might not define specific financial dimensions, including the main account, for Budgeting, which could provide more flexibility. For example, the account structure for the chart of accounts might have Department, Cost center, and main account financial dimensions. If you select the Department and Cost center financial dimensions for Budgeting, the departments and cost centers can hold budget amounts without regard to which main account is used.

1.  Click **Budgeting** \> **Setup** \> **Basic budgeting** \> **Dimensions for budgeting**.

2.  Select the financial dimensions in the **Chart of accounts dimension** list.

3.  Click the **\<** arrow button to move the financial dimensions to the **Budget dimension** list.
