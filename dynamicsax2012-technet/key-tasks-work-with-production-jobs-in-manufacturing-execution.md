## Register as an assistant and centralize registration

When multiple workers are assigned to the same production jobs, they can centralize the registration process by registering as an assistant to a selected worker. The result of this registration is a team, and the selected worker becomes the pilot worker for the team. A pilot worker can start jobs and enter registrations for the team members.

When you work as an assistant, you can register time for the jobs that the pilot worker starts. However, you cannot register the quantities that are produced on the jobs.

A team is assembled for the duration of the current shift. When all members of the team log off at the end of the shift, they must register as assistants again the next time that they log on. If you want the team to remain assembled for a longer duration, you can select the **Permanent teams** check box in the **Manufacturing execution parameters** form. If you select the check box, all teams will remain assembled.

You can view the members of the team in the Teams form in **Human resources**. For more information, see [Teams (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa585287\(v=ax.60\)).

To change the pilot of a team, the current pilot can click the **Assistant** button and select another worker. The members of the team become assistants to the new pilot.

The following step describes how to register as an assistant to a worker.

  - In the **Job registration** form, on the **Action Pane**, click **Assistant**, and then select the worker who will be the pilot.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If you are working on jobs in a job list, you may be prompted to provide feedback about the jobs before you can start working as an assistant. For more information, see the “Report feedback about production jobs” section in this topic.</P>

## Bundle jobs

When you work on multiple production jobs or operations at the same time, you are bundling the jobs. In the **Job registration** form, you can start several jobs at the same time. For more information about how to start a job, see “Start a production job” earlier in this topic.

You can add jobs to an existing bundle after you have started one or more of the jobs in the bundle.

1.  In the **Job registration** form, select the jobs to add to the bundle.
    
      - If you are using a touchscreen, tap the jobs that you want to start.
    
      - If you are not using a touchscreen, select the **Select** check box for each job that you want to start.

2.  Click **Bundle** on the **Action Pane**.

3.  Confirm that you want to start the selected jobs.

If you want to start a new job, but you do not want to bundle it with the first job, you must register the status of the first job.

## Reprioritize the jobs in a job list

In a job list, some jobs might have a high priority. An exclamation point in the **High priority** column identifies a high-priority job. You cannot change the sequence of high-priority jobs. However, depending on the configuration of the system, you might be able to change the sequence of the other jobs in your job list.

1.  Click **Production control** \> **Periodic** \> **Manufacturing execution** \> **Edit job list**. Select a production unit, resource group, or resource. Depending on the selection, click **Open production unit**, **Open resource group**, or **Open resource**.

2.  Select the jobs to reprioritize.
    
      - If you are using a touchscreen, tap the jobs that you want to move.
    
      - If you are not using a touchscreen, select the **Select** check box for each job that you want to move.

3.  Click the **Move up**, **Move down**, and **Move to line** buttons on the **Action Pane** to move the jobs to the correct position in the job list.

4.  Click **Submit sequence** on the **Action Pane**. The production jobs that you selected, and any jobs that are connected to the operation, are moved to the new position in the job list.

5.  Close the form.
    
      - If you are using a touchscreen, tap **Log out**.
    
      - If you are not using a touchscreen, click the **Close** button in the upper-right corner or press the ESC key.

## Assign a different resource to a job

You can move jobs from one resource to another resource in the same resource group. Moving jobs can be useful when, for example, a worker is ill or jobs are load balanced.

1.  Click **Production control** \> **Periodic** \> **Manufacturing execution** \> **Edit job list**. Select a production unit, resource group, or resource. Depending on the selection, click **Open production unit**, **Open resource group**, or **Open resource**.

2.  Select the jobs to change the resource for.
    
      - If you are using a touchscreen, tap the jobs that you want to change the resource for.
    
      - If you are not using a touchscreen, select the **Select** check box for each job that you want to change the resource for.

3.  Click **Change assigned resource** on the **Action Pane**.

4.  Select the resource to assign to the job.

5.  Click **Submit sequence** on the **Action Pane**. The assigned resource is changed for production jobs that you selected, and for any jobs that are connected to the operation. The **Job registration** form displays these jobs in their new order and priority.

6.  Close the form.
    
    1.  If you are using a touchscreen, tap **Log out**.
    
    2.  If you are not using a touchscreen, click the **Close** button in the upper-right corner, or press the ESC key.
