# Approve expense reports 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

If you are a user who approves expense reports, you can use the **My approvals** page to approve submitted expense reports.

You can approve an expense report for a worker who is employed in a legal entity other than the legal entity that you are employed in. For example, if you are employed by Fabrikam, Denmark, and you need to approve the expense report for a worker who is employed by Fabrikam, United States, you can approve the expense provided you have the appropriate security permissions.

When you view an expense report for approval, you might find that the report violates an expense policy, contains inaccurate information, or needs further explanation. In these types of situations, you can return the expense report to the employee for further clarification.

You also might want to view the history of the expense report, or assign the report to a delegate for approval.

1.  Click **Approvals** on the top link bar, and then click **My approvals** on the Quick Launch.

2.  Select an expense report, and then on the **Actions** menu, click one of the following options:
    
      - **Approve** – Approve the entire expense report. If your legal entity has selected to approve expense reports by line item instead of approving the entire document, a check box is displayed next to each transaction on the report. Select the check box to approve the line item transaction.
    
      - **Return** – Return the expense report to the worker who submitted it. You might do this if the information is incomplete or you have questions about the report.
    
      - **Delegate** – Assign the expense report to another user for approval. For more information, see [Add delegates](add-delegates.md).
    
      - **View history** – Open the **Workflow history details** page, where you can view the history and details of the expense report in the approval process. For more information, see [View the status and history of a document (Enterprise Portal)](view-the-status-and-history-of-a-document-enterprise-portal.md).
