# Approve a formula or formula version 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use this procedure to approve an existing formula or formula version. Before you can approve a formula, however, you must first add the items that make up the formula.

## Approve a formula

1.  Click **Inventory and warehouse management** \> **Common** \> **Formula**.

2.  Select the formula you want to approve.

3.  Click **Approve formula**. The **Approve BOM or formula** form appears.

4.  From the **Approved by** list, select the worker who is approving the formula.

5.  Click **OK**.

## Approve a formula version

1.  Click **Inventory and warehouse management** \> **Common** \> **Formula**.

2.  Select the formula version you want to approve.

3.  If you have not already approved the formula for this formula version, approve the formula following the procedure earlier in this topic. You can also approve it at the same time that you approve the formula version.

4.  Click **Approve**. The **Approve version** form appears.

5.  From the **Approved by** list, select the worker who is approving the formula version. If the formula has not already been approved, select the **Approve formula?** check box to approve it.

6.  Click **OK**.
