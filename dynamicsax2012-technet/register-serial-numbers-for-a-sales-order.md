## Enable serial number registration in the sales process

Before you can register serial numbers for products in the sales process, you must enable serial numbers for the sales process on the tracking dimension group, and assign the tracking dimension group to the product. You can enable serial numbers in the sales process for a tracking dimension group only if the tracking dimension group has not been used to create transactions.

When you enable serial numbers for the sales process in the tracking dimension group, all other selections for serial numbers are cleared except the **Blank issue allowed** check box. You can select the check box to allow products to be packed or invoiced without registering serial numbers.

To enable serial numbers for the sales process, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Product information management** \> **Setup** \> **Dimension groups** \> **Tracking dimension groups**.

2.  In the **Serial number** row, select the **Active in sales process** check box.

3.  Optional: To allow products to be issued without registering serial numbers, select the **Blank issue allowed** check box.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Normally, the <STRONG>Capture serial</STRONG> field and the <STRONG>Active</STRONG> check box are not used when you register serial numbers in the sales process. However, if you have Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 CU10 or KB 3072929 installed, you can use the <STRONG>Capture serial</STRONG> field to specify the following:</P>
    > <OL>
    > <LI>
    > <P><STRONG>None</STRONG> – Use this option if you want let the user manually select where to capture sales serial number. This could be from the packing slip, invoice, picking list registration, or load lines.</P>
    > <LI>
    > <P><STRONG>Picking</STRONG> – Capture the sales serial number when picking more than one serial number controlled item, using the mobile device.</P>
    > <LI>
    > <P><STRONG>Packing</STRONG> – Capture sales serial numbers when closing a container using the packing station.</P></LI></OL>
    > <P>For more information on how to use these options, see the <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dynamicsaxscm/archive/2015/12/07/enable-picking-of-sales-serial-number-items-with-r3-warehouse-management-processes.aspx">Dynamics AX SCM R&amp;D Team blog</A></P>
