The United States Department of the Treasury establishes trading partner codes, which are required for GFRS and FACTS I reporting.

If your organization follows U.S. governmental reporting rules for accounts receivables activity, you might benefit from adding this federally required attribute to your customer account information.

Follow this procedure to set up trading partner codes, which you can assign to the organizations that you do business with.

## Set up trading partner codes

Complete the steps below to create a new trading partner code.

1.  Click Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Trading partner codes**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a line for a new trading partner code.

3.  In the **Trading partner code** field, enter a unique code, such as 29. The code must be two to four characters long.

4.  In the **Description** field, enter a description of the organization that is represented by the trading partner code, such as Federal Trade Commission.
