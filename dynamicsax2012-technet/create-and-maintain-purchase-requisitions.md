# Create and maintain purchase requisitions 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use the **Purchase requisitions** page to create purchase requisitions and submit them to workflow.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> <P>This topic is aimed at Enterprise Portal users. If you are using the Dynamics AX desktop client, see <A href="key-tasks-create-and-submit-a-purchase-requisition.md">Key tasks: Create and submit a purchase requisition</A>.</P>



You can also create a new purchase requisition by copying the header and lines from an existing purchase requisition. For more information, see [Copy a purchase requisition](copy-a-purchase-requisition.md).

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, the concept of a requisition purpose has been introduced in order to allow for more flexibility in how requisition demand can be fulfilled. When you create a requisition, you can assign it one of two purposes: consumption or replenishment. Depending on the purpose of the requisition, demand can be fulfilled by a purchase order, transfer order, production order, or kanban. For more information about requisition purposes and how they affect the requisition process, see [About purchase requisitions (Enterprise Portal)](about-purchase-requisitions-enterprise-portal.md).

## Create a purchase requisition

1.  Click **Procurement** on the top link bar, and then click **Purchase requisitions** \> **Purchase requisitions prepared by me** on the Quick Launch.

2.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Purchase requisition** tab, in the **New** group, click **Purchase requisition**.

3.  Enter a name for the purchase requisition.

4.  Enter the date by which you want to receive the requested items.

5.  If the requisition purpose is consumption, enter the accounting date for the purchase requisition transaction. This date is used to record the accounting entry in the general ledger, and to validate that budget funds are available.

6.  If the requisition purpose is consumption, and the purchase requisition has lines for project expenditures, select the **Select default project** check box, and then enter the following information:
    
      - In the **Buying legal entity** field, select the legal entity to which the project is assigned.
    
      - In the **Project ID** field, select the project ID to display by default on all purchase requisition lines for the project.

7.  Click **Create**.

8.  You can add items to the purchase requisition now. Alternatively, you can save and close the purchase requisition, and then add items to it later. Do one of the following:
    
      - To add items to the purchase requisition now, follow the steps in the next procedure in this topic, "Add items to a purchase requisition."
    
      - To add items to the purchase requisition later, click **Save and close**. When you are ready to add the items, follow the steps in the procedure "Modify a purchase requisition," later in this topic.
