# About backorders 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Backorders are either purchase orders that are not yet delivered from a vendor or sales orders that are not yet delivered to a customer.

It is important to follow up on backorders. For example, if products are delayed from vendors, you might have to change the date of delivery to customers and inform the customers about the delay.

You can see an overview of the status of backorders by using one of the following categories: items, customers, or vendors.

## View backorders by item

When you view backorders by item, you can follow up on the expected future flow of transactions for a specific item. For example, you can check:

  - How many sales orders are placed on an item.

  - Whether deliveries of products from vendors are still missing.

  - Whether more items should be ordered to enable you to deliver all sales orders in due time.

The overview also helps you answer requests from customers about the time of delivery. In addition, you can prioritize the sales backorders and split the items that are on hand between the orders. For more information, see [View backorders by item](view-backorders-by-item.md).

## View backorders by customer

When you view backorders by customer, you can view the status of the customer's remaining orders. This is useful when you answer questions from customers who are waiting for items for which delivery has been delayed. For more information, see [View backorders by customer](view-backorders-by-customer.md).

## View backorders by vendor

When you view backorders by vendor, you can follow up on missing deliveries and expected dates of deliveries.

The overview is also useful for prioritization when products arrive from vendors and the sales orders have to be picked for delivery. For more information, see [View backorders by vendor](view-backorders-by-vendor.md).
