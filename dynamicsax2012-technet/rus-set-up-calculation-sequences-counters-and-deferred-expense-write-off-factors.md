      - **Linear** – Provides an equivalent amount for deferrals write-off within a given interval over the defined period.
    
      - **Manual** – The percentage of the total to be written off in each period is entered manually in the **Manual schedules** form.
    
      - **Linear with factor** – The calculated result is multiplied by a calculated ratio.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Set the deferred expense write-off factor between 0 and 1, defined according to the following formula: Factor = Standard Amount / Base Amount. In order to take into account the deferred write-off for the current period during factor calculation, define the value of the base amount with the line type <STRONG>Deferral write-off</STRONG>.</P>



16. In the **Writing off period** field, select the write-off period for the deferred expense.

      - **Day** – The deferrals write-off calculation is performed proportionately to the number of days in the selected period. This allows calculation of deferrals write-off during an incomplete reporting period, depending on the number of calendar days.
    
      - **Period** – The deferrals write-off calculation is performed proportionately to the number of periods that are defined in the **Writing off period** field.
