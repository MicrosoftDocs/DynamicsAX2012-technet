<td><p>Letters of guarantee</p></td>
<td><p>A letter of guarantee is an undertaking by a financial institution such as a bank (the guarantor) to pay another person (the beneficiary) an amount of money that has been agreed on if the financial institution’s customer (the principal) defaults on a debt or an obligation to the beneficiary. The beneficiary must claim the guaranteed amount from the guarantor before the expiration date of the letter of guarantee. To liquidate the agreement, the beneficiary submits the original letter of guarantee to the bank before the letter’s expiration date. The letter of guarantee is nontransferable and applies only to the beneficiary whose name is included in the guarantee agreement. A letter of guarantee helps customers complete the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create correct ledger entries and eliminate manual entry.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate a report that includes the bank facilities and usage of those facilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the monetary and nonmonetary transactions that are involved, and track the balances of letters of guarantee.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the letter of guarantee cycle, and the expiration date and status of letters of guarantee.</p></li>
</ul>
