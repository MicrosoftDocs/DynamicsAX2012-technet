# Maintain planned orders 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can manage planned orders from the **Planned production orders**, **Planned purchase orders**, and **Planned transfer** forms.

You can use the **Status** field to help track your progress. The following options are available:

  - When master scheduling generates planned orders, the planned orders have a status of **Unprocessed**.

  - When you select not to firm a planned order, you can give it a status of **Completed**.

  - When you firm a planned order, you can give it a status of **Approved**. This indicates that you approve firming the planned order, but it is not firmed yet.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>An approved planned order is transferred in its current state to the next master schedule calculation.</P>



You can firm planned orders by clicking **Firm**. You can firm the following planned orders:

  - The planned order that is selected on the **Overview** tab.

  - Multiple planned orders. Select multiple planned orders to firm.

  - Planned orders that are generated by an explosion from the **Explosion** form. Click **Planned orders**, select the planned order, and then click **Firm**.

When a planned order is firmed, it is moved to the orders section of the relevant module.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can right-click a planned order that has a particular status and filter for other planned orders that have the same status. This is useful, for example, if you want to filter for all planned orders that have a status of <STRONG>Approved</STRONG>, and then firm them.</P>



## Analyzing a planned order

When a planned order is exploded, details about the outcome are displayed on the **Explanation** tab in the **Explosion** form. This requires that tracing is enabled. For more information, see [About using tracing for master plans](about-using-tracing-for-master-plans.md).
