# (BRA) Set up NFC-e parameters to issue an NFC-e for a POS sales transaction 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

A Nota Fiscal Consumidor eletrônica (NFC-e) is an electronic fiscal document that is generated and printed to register the sale of an item to a consumer. This topic explains how to set up the parameters that are required to issue or cancel an NFC-e. After setting up these parameters, you must run a retail scheduler job to synchronize these changes with the POS to be able to complete NFC-e transactions.

## Set up NFC-e parameters for fiscal establishments

Use this procedure to set up NFC-e parameters for fiscal establishments.

To complete this procedure, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Brazil** \> **Fiscal establishments**.

2.  Create a new fiscal establishment, and enter basic information about it. For more information, see [(BRA) Fiscal establishments (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj933531\(v=ax.60\)).

3.  Enter the tax identification number of the fiscal establishment in the **CNPJ/CPF** field.

4.  On the **NF-e/NFC-e federal** FastTab, in the **Certificate** field, select the digital certificate that is required to generate an NFC-e.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>A digital certificate for NFC-e transactions must be installed and available before you can use it to generate NFC-es.</P>



5.  In the **NFC-e web service** field group, in the **Environment** field, select **Testing** or **Production** to indicate whether the NFC-e transaction is completed in a testing environment or a production environment.

6.  In the **The version of the NFC-e feature** field, select the NFC-e version.

7.  In the **Authority** field, select the tax authority that is authorized to reject or approve an NFC-e.

8.  Optional: In the **Approved NFC-e** field, select the email template for an approved NFC-e.

9.  Optional: Select the **Attach the DANFE NFC-e as a PDF file to email** check box to attach the NFC-e DANFE as a PDF file to email.

## Specify the end points for an NFC-e web service

Use this procedure to specify the end points for an NFC-e web service. The web service URL is used to communicate with the tax authority for the authorization of an issued NFC-e.

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Brazil** \> **NF-e federal parameters**.

2.  Create a new authority, and then in the lower pane specify the mode of operation for the NFC-e transaction. For more information about setting parameters for a tax authority, see [(BRA) Set up NF-e federal parameters](bra-set-up-nf-e-federal-parameters.md).

3.  In the **Web service** field, select the type of XML message that is used to communicate with the authority by using the web service environment address.

4.  In the **Version** field, select the version of the NFC-e.

5.  In the **Internet address** field, enter the address of the web service.

## Specify NFC-e attributes for a POS register

Use this procedure to set up attributes for a POS register to perform NFC-e operations. You can also configure a non-fiscal printer in the POS hardware profile form to print a the DANFE NFC-e without a fiscal printer. For more information, see [POS hardware profile (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh580636\(v=ax.60\)).

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **POS** \> **POS registers**.

2.  Create a new register or double-click an existing POS register. For more information, see [POS registers (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh597141\(v=ax.60\)) and [Set up registers](set-up-registers.md).

3.  On the **Fiscal information** FastTab, in the **Fiscal operation mode** field, select **NFC-e**. You can select **Fiscal printer** to use the POS register only for fiscal printer operations.

4.  In the **Fiscal document series** field, enter the fiscal document series, which is used to generate the serial number for NFC-es. You cannot enter the same fiscal document series for multiple registers within the same retail store.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>This field is available only if you select <STRONG>NFC-e</STRONG> in the <STRONG>Fiscal operation mode</STRONG> field.</P>



## Set up receipt profiles for NFCe-s

Use this procedure to set up a receipt profile for NFC-es. You can configure the simplified or detailed DANFE receipt formats for NFC-es.

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **POS** \> **Profiles** \> **Receipt profiles**.

2.  Create a new receipt profile. For more information, see [Set up receipt profiles](set-up-receipt-profiles.md).

3.  On the **General** FastTab, click **Add** to add a receipt format to the profile.

4.  In the **Receipt type** field, select **Simplified DANFE** or **Detailed DANFE**. The **Simplified DANFE** layout does not contain the item details. Only the total item quantity and related fiscal information are displayed.

5.  In the **Receipt format** field, select a receipt format. You can view the selected receipt format by clicking **Designer**.

## Assign info codes for voiding an NFC-e or to issue an NFC-e in contingency mode

Use this procedure to create and assign info codes that indicate the reason for voiding an issued NFC-e or for issuing an NFC-e in contingency mode.

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Info codes**.

2.  Create info codes and subcodes for NFC-es. Select **Subcode list** as the input type for the info code, and enter a 15-character description for the subcode. For more information about info codes and subcodes, see [Set up info codes](set-up-info-codes.md).

3.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **POS** \> **Profiles** \> **Functionality profiles**.

4.  Create a functionality profile or select an existing functionality profile.

5.  On the **Info codes** FastTab, in the **Contingency reason** field, select the info code that is used to indicate the reason for issuing an NFC-e in contingency mode.

6.  In the **Voiding reason** field, select the info code that is used to indicate the reason for voiding an issued NFC-e.

## Determine the taxation code that is applicable for NFC-es

Taxation is applied to NFC-e sale transaction based on Código FIscal de Operações e Prestações (CFOP) codes. The applicable tax rates are determined by crossing the item sales tax group assigned for the item in the **Released product details** form with the sales tax group selected for the retail store. The taxation code resolved for the tax rates is crossed with the product type specified in the **Released product details** form to determine the CFOP code.

## Optional: Set up number sequences for NFC-es

Use this procedure to specify a value other than the default value that is used to initialize the numbering for the issued NFC-es.

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Periodic** \> **Retail POS redeployment**.

2.  Select a retail store, and then click **Edit POS counters**.

3.  In the **NFC-e** field, enter a value that is used to generate a number sequence for NFC-es.

## Next step

  - After setting up these parameters you can issue and print an NFC-e in POS. For more information, see (BRA) Issue and print DANFE for NFC-es.

  - After issuing and printing an NFC-e in POS, you can calculate and post a statement for the NFC-e and view the details of the posted statement in the **All fiscal documents** form. For more information about creating, calculating, and posting statements POS transactions, see [Create and post a statement](create-and-post-a-statement.md).
    
    1.  Click **Retail** \> **Inquiries** \> **All fiscal documents**.
    
    2.  Select a posted fiscal document, and then click **Totals**, **Voucher**, or **Charges** to view the total taxes and voucher details of the NFC-e. The posted NFC-e can have one of the following statuses
        
          - **Approved** – The NFC-e has been authorized and approved by the tax authority.
        
          - **Canceled** – The NFC-e was voided.
        
          - **Created** – The NFC-e was created in contingency mode.
    
    3.  Optional: On the **NF-e federal**, click **Export PDF** to export the DANFE NFC-e as a PDF file.
    
    4.  Optional: Click **Send e-mail** to send the DANFE NFC-e in an email.

  - Create a tax assessment and generate SPED fiscal files for NFC-e transactions. For more information about preparing the tax assessment, see topics under [(BRA) Setting up fiscal books](bra-setting-up-fiscal-books.md) and [(BRA) Working with fiscal books](bra-working-with-fiscal-books.md).
