    For more information, see [Insert a node in the modeling tree](insert-a-node-in-the-modeling-tree.md).
    
    The BOM lines will be added to the BOM version assigned the site ID identified by the site ID system variable.

    For more information, see [Insert a node in the modeling tree](insert-a-node-in-the-modeling-tree.md).
