# Deprecated: Department hierarchy control 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, you could use the **Organization Units** form to define department structure. You could then use the **Organization View** form to view the structure in a graphical format.

## Overview

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Reason for deprecation</p></td>
<td><p>The department hierarchy control has been deprecated in favor of new organization hierarchy functionality.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Replaced by another feature</p></td>
<td><p>Yes. New organization hierarchy functionality was added in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. This new functionality provides flexibility in a new shared model. You can combine hierarchies across companies and also include different types of organizational units, such as departments, in the structure of the hierarchy.</p>
