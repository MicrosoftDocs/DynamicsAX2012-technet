# Deprecated: Department hierarchy control 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, you could use the **Organization Units** form to define department structure. You could then use the **Organization View** form to view the structure in a graphical format.

<td><p>Yes. New organization hierarchy functionality was added in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. This new functionality provides flexibility in a new shared model.
