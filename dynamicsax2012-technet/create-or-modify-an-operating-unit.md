# Create or modify an operating unit 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

An operating unit is an organization that is used to divide the control of economic resources and operational processes in a business. People in an operating unit have a duty to maximize the use of scarce resources, improve processes, and account for their performance.

In Microsoft Dynamics AX, the types of operating units include cost centers, business units, departments, and value streams. Use the information in this topic to create a new operating unit or modify an existing operating unit.

Organizations that are relevant to other application areas can also be set up in Human resources and General ledger.
