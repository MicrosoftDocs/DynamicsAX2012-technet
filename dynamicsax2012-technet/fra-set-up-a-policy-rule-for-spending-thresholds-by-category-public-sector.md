# (FRA) Set up a policy rule for spending thresholds by category (Public sector) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

To meet public sector regulatory requirements in France, you may have to set spending thresholds for purchases in the procurement categories defined by the Clé de Contrôle Marché.

By implementing a **Spending thresholds by category** policy rule with your purchasing policies, you can use the effective date attributes, predicted expenditure amounts, and threshold amounts to support your procurement practices and to ensure the efficient and effective use of public funds.

To set up a policy rule for spending thresholds by category, use the following steps.

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Setup** \> **Policies** \> **Purchasing policies**.

2.  Double-click the policy to modify or create rules for.

3.  On the **Policy rules** FastTab, select **Spending thresholds by category**. In the **Policy rules** pane, double-click a policy rule or click **Create policy rule**.
    
    Because the policy rule is effective as soon as it is created, the **Effective date** field will show the current date and time. The **Expiration date** field, by default, is **Never**, which indicates that the policy rule does not expire. If you want to set an expiration date for the policy rule, you can do so after you close this form.

4.  From the **Available categories** list, select a category to define spending thresholds for.

5.  Select the **Activate threshold at this hierarchy node** check box.

6.  Click **New**.

7.  Enter the **Key** defined by your organization for the selected category.

8.  In the **Effective** field, enter the date that you want the key for the selected category to take effect.
    
    This date applies to the selected category key, not to the policy rule. The policy rule itself takes effect as soon as it is created.

9.  In the **Expiration** field, enter the date that you want the key for the selected category to expire.
    
    This date applies to the selected category key, not to the policy rule. If the policy rule expires, all spending thresholds associated with it expire at that time, even if a later expiration date is set here.

10. (Optional) In the **Estimated amount** field, enter the amount that you expect to be purchased in this category.

11. In the **Threshold amount** field, enter the maximum amount that can be purchased before the formal procurement process is required.
    
    A default value for this field may be set up in the **Category hierarchy** form.

12. Select the type of purchasing procedure that is required when expenditures in the selected category exceed the threshold amount.
    
      - **Only Procédure complète**: Select this option if the procédure complete is required.
    
      - **None**: Select this option if purchases that exceed the threshold amount are not permitted.
    
      - **Both Procédure complète and Procédure adaptée**: Select this option if either the procédure complete or a procédure adaptée is permitted.
    
      - **Any**: Select this option if neither the procédure complete nor a procédure adaptée is required.

13. Close the form.

14. (Optional) If you want to set an expiration date for the policy rule, make sure that **Spending thresholds by category** is still selected in the **Policy rule type:** list. Click **Change date** in the **Policy rules** pane, enter the expiration date, and then close the form.
