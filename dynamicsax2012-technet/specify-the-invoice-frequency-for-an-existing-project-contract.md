# Specify the invoice frequency for an existing project contract 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The invoice frequency that is specified for a project contract is one of two factors that determine the sales payment date on a forecast. The other factor, for time-and-material projects only, is the number of buffer days that are allowed as a grace period. Buffer days are set up in the **Project management and accounting parameters** form.

The invoice frequency plus the number of buffer days determine when a sales payment is due.
