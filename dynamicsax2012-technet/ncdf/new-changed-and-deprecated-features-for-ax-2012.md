This library provides a summary of new and changed features for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, including Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, and Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3.

  - What’s new – Topics in the What’s new section describe new and changed features that are included in AX 2012, AX 2012 Feature Pack, AX 2012 R2, and AX 2012 R3 releases. Some What’s new topics are focused on all the features that have been added to a specific module.

  - Deprecated features – Topics in the deprecated features section provide details about the features that have been removed from the application in this version, or that are planned for removal in subsequent versions.
