# Set up offline profiles (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to set up offline profiles to specify which data is synchronized between a retail store database and the offline databases at point-of-sale (POS) registers. Each offline profile consists of several *offline scopes*. Offline scopes define the order in which data is synchronized, and which database tables are synchronized.

Retail essentials includes a default offline profile that is named "Default pr." The offline scopes that are included in the default offline profile are similar to the organization of jobs in **Retail scheduler**. You can set up custom offline profiles to fit your business needs.


> [!WARNING]
> <P>You can modify the default offline profile that is included with Retail essentials. However, if you modify a store's offline profile after you create the store's offline databases, you must run the Store Database Utility again on all the registers in the store to reprovision the offline databases for those registers.</P>
