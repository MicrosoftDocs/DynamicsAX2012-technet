# (BRA) Set up parameters for SPED EFD - Contributions 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

This topic explains how to specify parameters for SPED EFD - Contributions text files by using the **EFD – Contributions parameters** form.

The SPED EFD - Contributions text files are generated by legal entities that already have the obligation to issue Accounting and Fiscal SPED. The text files include the transactions that represent the Programa de Integração Social (PIS) and Contribuição para o Financiamento da Seguridade Social (COFINS) taxable and non-taxable revenue, and the cost or expenses with credit of PIS and COFINS.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The procedure for completing this task has changed for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3. For information that is specific to Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, see the section later in this topic.</P>
