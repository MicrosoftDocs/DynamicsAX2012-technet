# (BRA) Cancel a free text invoice 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can cancel a posted free text invoice that is incorrect. When you cancel a free text invoice, a negative free text invoice is created. When you post the negative free text invoice, the original and negative free text invoices are marked as canceled, and all the ledger and financial transactions are reversed. The original transaction is reported in the fiscal books as canceled, and the negative transaction is not reported in the fiscal books.

2.  Select a posted free text invoice to cancel.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Invoice** tab, click **Cancel fiscal document**.

4.  In the **Reason code** field, select the reason code for the reason to cancel the free text invoice. The **Comments** field is updated with the comments for the selected reason code. These comments are specified in the **Default comment** field in the **Customer reasons** form.
