# (BRA) Create sites 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can create sites by specifying fiscal establishments for those sites. When you assign the sites to fiscal documents, the fiscal information in the fiscal documents is updated based on the fiscal establishments of the sites. For more information, see [(BRA) About fiscal establishments](bra-about-fiscal-establishments.md), [(BRA) Create and post a purchase order](bra-create-and-post-a-purchase-order.md), [(BRA) Create and post a return purchase order](bra-create-and-post-a-return-purchase-order.md), and [(BRA) Create and post a sales order](bra-create-and-post-a-sales-order.md).

Use this procedure to create a site.

1.  Click **Inventory management** \> **Setup** \> **Inventory breakdown** \> **Sites**.

2.  Create a site. For more information, see [Create sites](create-sites.md).

3.  In the **Fiscal establishment ID** field, select the fiscal establishment for the site. The address of the fiscal establishment from the **Address** FastTab in the **Fiscal establishment** form is updated in the **Name or description**, **Address**, **Purpose**, and **Primary** fields on the **Address** FastTab in the **Sites** form.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You cannot add, modify, or delete the address on the <STRONG>Address</STRONG> FastTab.</P>
