<td><p>For the straight-line-life remaining depreciation method, a new parameter is added to allow you to apply rules for additional acquisition and acquisition adjustment transactions. After you enable the parameter, the depreciation of additional acquisitions and acquisition adjustments is calculated according to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The amounts of additional acquisitions that are posted during the year of initial acquisition are depreciated starting from the depreciation run date.</p></li>
<li><p>The amounts of additional acquisitions posted in the year later than year of initial acquisition are depreciated starting from the first day of the year.</p></li>

<li><p>For additional acquisitions posted in the year of initial acquisition, the depreciation amount is adjusted starting from the depreciation run date.</p></li>

The quarterly return for the traders report displays outward transactions and the corresponding inward transactions.</p>
<p></p>
