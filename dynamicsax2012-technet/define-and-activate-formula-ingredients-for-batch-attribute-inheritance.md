# Define and activate formula ingredients for batch attribute inheritance 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can select ingredients that are used to update the product characteristic or batch attribute information for finished items. If you select an ingredient for which you have specified the same batch attributes in the **Product specific** form as for the finished item, the **Inherit batch attributes to end item** check box is available in the **Formula line** form. If the formula version contains co-products, the **Inherit batch attributes to co-product** check box is available in the **Formula line** form.

You can select all the batch attribute ingredients for which the batch attributes are updated for the finished items. If multiple ingredients are associated with the same batch attribute, you can select only one ingredient to update for the finished items.

You can select batch attributes from each ingredient to update batch attribute information for the finished items. If multiple ingredients have different batch attributes, you can select the batch attributes to apply and activate the batch attribute transfer. However, if there is an ingredient that has the same batch attributes as another ingredient, you cannot activate the batch attribute transfer.

You can approve and activate the formula version after you select all the active batch attributes.

After you define and activate batch attributes in the formula ingredients, you can create batch orders and process the finished item and any related co-products. After you run the report as finished process, the active batch attributes are updated in the inventory batches for the finished item and related co-products.
