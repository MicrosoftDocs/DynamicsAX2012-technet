# Retail Benchmark for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 


In 2013, Microsoft conducted a benchmark on Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 to measure the performance and scalability characteristics of the Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 retail solution in a simulated retail scenario. The benchmark showcases the ability of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 to handle various specialized loads concurrently, without compromising performance and scalability on critical business processes. The benchmark includes many functional scenarios across different client and integration technologies, thereby providing a view of retail back-end scenarios. The following scenarios were executed to complete the benchmark:

The following scenarios were executed to complete the benchmark:

  - Trickle feed of point of sale (POS) transactions from stores

  - End-of-day processing of POS transactions:
    
      - Inventory reservations were made for the imported transactions.
    
      - Imported POS transactions were consolidated and aggregated, and then transferred to statements in a peak load situation.
    
      - Statements were processed and transferred to sales orders, and financial updates were posted.

The scenarios generate load on an instance of Application Object Server (AOS).

With minimal hardware, we were able to complete end-of-day processing for 800,000 POS transactions in approximately four hours.
