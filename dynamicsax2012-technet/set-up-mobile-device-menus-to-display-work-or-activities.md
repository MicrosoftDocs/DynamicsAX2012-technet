# Set up mobile device menus to display work or activities 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic applies to features in the <STRONG>Warehouse management</STRONG> module. It does not apply to features in the <A href="inventory-management.md">Inventory management</A> module.</P>



This topic describes how to set up the menu that is displayed on a mobile device to display work or activities. The menu contains the menu items that a warehouse worker will use to perform their work. You create the structure of the mobile device menu by adding menu items and menus. When you add a menu, its menu items are also assigned.

## Set up mobile device menus to display work or activities

To create a menu for a mobile device, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Warehouse management** \> **Setup** \> **Mobile device** \> **Mobile device menu**.

2.  Click **New** to create a new menu.

3.  In the **Name** field, enter a unique name for the mobile device menu. After you enter the name, a folder with the menu name is displayed on the **Menu structure** pane in the lower part of the form. The folder is the top node in the menu structure.

4.  In the **Description** field, enter a short description of the menu.

5.  To add menu items to the menu structure, in the **Available menus and menu items** pane, select a menu item or menu, and then drag it to the **Menu structure** pane. Repeat this step until you have added all of the menu items and menus that you want to include in the menu.

## Next step

The next step in the process of setting up a mobile device is to define the appearance of the display. For more information, see [Define the look and feel of mobile device displays](define-the-look-and-feel-of-mobile-device-displays.md).
