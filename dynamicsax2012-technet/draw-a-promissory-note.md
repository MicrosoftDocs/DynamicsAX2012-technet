# Draw a promissory note 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can draw a promissory note automatically or in a journal. A promissory note always is based on an open vendor transaction that has a status of **Invoiced** on the **All purchase orders** list page.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If the <STRONG>Public sector</STRONG> configuration key is selected, the payment proposal process interacts with the posting invoice in an additional way. You can distribute the payment of an invoice to multiple vendor bank accounts. In the <STRONG>Vendor invoice</STRONG> form, you can select multiple bank accounts and allocate a percentage to each bank account. Based on the vendor bank accounts that you select, single or multiple open transactions are created for the invoice. You can create payments for each journal line without creating a partial payment for each vendor bank account.</P>



When you draw a promissory note, it appears as an open vendor transaction for the vendor in the **Vendor transactions** form. (Click **Accounts payable** \> **Common** \> **Vendors** \> **All vendors**. Select a vendor account. On the **Action Pane**, click **Transactions**.) You can identify a promissory note transaction by viewing the **Note ID**, **Status**, **Sequence number**, and **Remittance number** fields on the **Overview** tab, and the **Company** and **Vendor** bank account fields on the **Payment** tab.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>When you transfer transactions to a journal, the way that due dates are handled depends on how you select the transactions. Click <STRONG>Accounts receivable</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Journals</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Payments</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Payment journal</STRONG>. Click <STRONG>Lines</STRONG>. You can click <STRONG>Payment proposal</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Create payment proposal</STRONG> to select transactions by using a query that is set up to select the total number of payments that are due as of a specific date. If you use a payment proposal, the date that you enter in the <STRONG>Total payment date</STRONG> field is used for all transferred transactions. If you select transactions manually in the <STRONG>Settle open transactions</STRONG> form, the latest due date of the selected transactions is used.</P>
