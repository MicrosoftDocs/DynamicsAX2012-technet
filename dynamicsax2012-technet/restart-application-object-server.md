_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Upgrades and updates require restarting the Application Object Server (AOS) at various times. If you are running multiple AOS instances, you may need to restart all of them.

For developer documentation about code upgrade in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, see the downloadable [code upgrade white papers](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=215083). See also *Inside Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009*, Chapter 18: “Code upgrade,” pp. 623–644..

## Restarting the Application Object Server

### To restart the Application Object Server

1.  When you have finished importing the layer, restart the Microsoft Dynamics AX process in Services.

2.  When the AOS has restarted, continue with the next steps in the checklist. Then, return to this step when you are ready to import the next highest layer.
