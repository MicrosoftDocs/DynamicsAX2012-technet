# (POL) Calculate depreciation 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can calculate depreciation for fixed assets with an **Open** status for periods in which depreciation has not yet been posted.

**Example**

Available depreciation methods for Poland are:

  - **Reducing balance (Poland)** - This depreciation method considers special local legal requirements about Fixed asset value change during fiscal year and cost part recognition.

  - **Straight line (Poland)** – Depreciation is calculated for the first period for the number days that the asset was used. For example, if a fixed asset was purchased January 15 and the depreciation period starts January 1, depreciation will be calculated for half of the period.

  - **Straight line percentage (Poland)** – The service life is calculated by entering a percentage and dividing 100% by the percentage entered. For example, if you entered 20%, 100% divided by 20% is 5 service years.

Depreciation for all fixed assets can be calculated and posted in one single operation.

1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Journals** \> **Fixed assets**.

2.  Click **Proposals** \> **Depreciation proposal** to open the **Depreciation proposal** form.

3.  In the **To date** field, enter the date through which depreciation is calculated.

4.  Select the **Summarize depreciation** check box to summarize all monthly depreciation into one journal line for a single fixed asset or value model.
