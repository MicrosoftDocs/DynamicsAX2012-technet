# (ESP) Generate Report 340 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

After you post vendor and customer transactions, you can generate Report 340 for all vendor invoices and customer invoices. You can transfer vendor invoices and customer invoices to the **Spanish VAT reports** form. You can then verify the information for each line, and generate the report as an ASCII file. For more information about Report 340, see [(ESP) Report 340](esp-report-340.md).

## 1\. Create Report 340

Use the **Spanish VAT list** form to transfer vendor invoices and customer invoices to the **Spanish VAT reports** form. You can specify a threshold for the cash amount that is received from a customer in the **Spanish VAT list** form. If the cash amount of the combined transactions for the customer exceeds the specified limit, then the amount is included in the report.

To create Report 340, follow these steps:

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Periodic** \> **Sales tax payments** \> **Spain** \> **Spanish VAT reports**.

2.  Click **Create new** to open the **Spanish VAT list** form. For more information, see [(ESP) Spanish VAT list (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa577152\(v=ax.60\)).

3.  Specify the criteria for transferring the invoices to the **Spanish VAT reports** form.

4.  In the **Minimum payment amount in cash** field, enter the threshold value of the cash amount in the accounting currency that is received from the customer. This value is used to filter the invoices that are transferred to the report.

5.  Click **OK** to transfer the invoices to the **Spanish VAT reports** form. For more information, see [(ESP) Spanish VAT reports (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa554510\(v=ax.60\)).

## 2\. Verify the VAT report lines and generate Report 340

You can verify the **Operation type** field values for the VAT report lines, and then generate the report as an ASCII file.

To verify the VAT report lines and generate Report 340, follow these steps:

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Periodic** \> **Sales tax payments** \> **Spain** \> **Spanish VAT reports**.

2.  In the **Spanish VAT reports** form, click **VAT report lines** to open the **VAT report lines** form. For more information, see [(ESP) VAT report lines (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa557419\(v=ax.60\)).
