# End a scheduled questionnaire 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can end a scheduled questionnaire after all respondents have completed their assigned answer sessions. After a scheduled questionnaire is ended, you cannot copy its settings to a new scheduling.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Before you can end a scheduled questionnaire, you must plan an answer session. If one or more respondents have not completed the questionnaire and you still want to end the scheduling, you must first delete the relevant respondents from the list in the <STRONG>Planned answer session</STRONG> form. You can then end the scheduling. For more information, see <A href="about-planned-answer-sessions-in-questionnaire.md">About planned answer sessions in questionnaire</A>, <A href="distributing-questionnaires.md">Distributing questionnaires</A>, and <A href="using-questionnaires.md">Using questionnaires</A>.</P>



1.  Click **Home** \> **Common** \> **Questionnaires** \> **Questionnaire schedules**.

2.  Select the scheduling to end, click **Functions**, and then select **End**.

3.  Click **OK** to end the scheduling.
