# Modify metadata for question groups in RapidStart Services 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Beginning October 1, 2015, RapidStart services will no longer be supported. For more information, see the announcement on CustomerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/northamerica/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued or PartnerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/news-events/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued.

As the Designer for a Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services project, you can group related questions together in a question group. Each of these question groups will be assigned to a specific worker in your organization to answer. Certain metadata are assigned to a question group when it is created. You can modify the metadata for a question group. That metadata includes the following:

  - The group name

  - The functional area to which the group is assigned

  - An optional description of the group

  - The release versions, industries, and locales for which the group is enabled


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You cannot change the metadata values for a question group that belongs to a published functional area. To change those values, you must first unpublish the functional area. For information about how to unpublish a functional area, see <A href="unpublish-a-functional-area-in-rapidstart-services.md">Unpublish a functional area in RapidStart Services</A>.</P>



1.  In the RapidStart Services header, click **Design**, and then click **Functional area**.

2.  In the **Functional area** list, select the functional area that contains the question group for which you want to modify metadata.

3.  Click the row of the question group that you want to modify.
    

    > [!TIP]
    > <P>Do not click in the <STRONG>Question group name</STRONG> column. Doing so opens the page that is used to create and update questions.</P>



4.  Click the **Question group** button, and then click **Edit question group**.

5.  Change the fields as required, and then click **OK**.
