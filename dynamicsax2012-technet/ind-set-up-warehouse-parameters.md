# (IND) Set up warehouse parameters 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

The warehouses of a company are considered as separate business locations and taxes are applied for stock transfer transactions between warehouses of the same company.

To set up a warehouse parameter, you must:

  - Set up ledger accounts for each tax registration number. You can record the financial impact of stock transfer between warehouses.

  - Define the transfer price for items and attach taxes for an item transfer transaction.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can also generate stock transfer reports that display tax amounts, transfer prices, and other details.</P>
