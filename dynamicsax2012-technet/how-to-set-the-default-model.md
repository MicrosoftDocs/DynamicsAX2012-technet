# How to: Set the Default Model 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

To make sure that resources are added to the correct model, you can specify the model that is active by default when you start the Development Workspace.

## Setting the Default Model

### To set the default model

1.  Open the Development Workspace. See [How to: Open a Development Workspace](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg846350\(v=ax.60\)) for more information.

2.  Choose **Tools** \> **Options**.

3.  Click **Development** to display the options for the Development Workspace.

4.  Expand the **General** group.

5.  Set the **Startup model** to the model that you want to be active when you start the Development Workspace.

6.  Click **Close**.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> <P>Setting the default model affects future sessions of the Development Workspace. It does not change which model is selected in the current session. To specify the model to use in the current session of the Development Workspace, see <A href="how-to-specify-the-current-model.md">How to: Specify the Current Model</A>.</P>
