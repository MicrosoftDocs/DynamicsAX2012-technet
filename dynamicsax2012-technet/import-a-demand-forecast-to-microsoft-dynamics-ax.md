## Import a demand forecast

To import a demand forecast to AX 2012 R3, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Master planning** \> **Periodic** \> **Demand forecasting** \> **Import forecast**.

2.  On the **General** tab, in the **Import settings** field group, the **Start** field contains the start date of the most recent baseline forecast. The **End** field contains the end date of the forecast, based on the forecast bucket and forecast horizon that are defined in the **Create statistical baseline forecast** form. These are the default settings, but you can change them.

3.  Select the **Save the manual adjustments made to the baseline demand forecast** check box to make sure that adjustments to the demand forecast are saved after it has been imported.
    
    If you donâ€™t select this check box, the adjustments are deleted after the forecast is imported. You can use this setting to discard all manual adjustments that have been made to the demand forecast.

4.  In the grid, use the **Add** and **Remove** buttons to select the companies and corresponding forecast models to which the demand forecast will be imported. By default, all companies for which there is forecast data in the cube are displayed. For each company, the **Inventory forecast model** that is defined for the static master plan in the **Master plans** form is also displayed by default. If you select a company for which there is no demand forecast data in the cube, a warning message is displayed.

5.  Click **OK** to import the demand forecast.
