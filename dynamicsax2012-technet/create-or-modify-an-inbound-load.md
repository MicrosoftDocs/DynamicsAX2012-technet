# Create or modify an inbound load 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic applies to features in the <STRONG>Transportation management</STRONG> module. It does not apply to features in the <A href="inventory-management.md">Inventory management</A> module.</P>



This topic explains how to create or modify an inbound load. You can use a purchase order to create an inbound load automatically or manually. You can also modify an existing inbound load by adding a new purchase order line.

Load planning is one of the transportation functions performed by transportation coordinators. The inbound load process starts when there is a demand for specific items that have to be shipped from a vendor location to a company’s warehouse location.

## This task is part of a bigger process

The following illustration shows how creating an inbound load relates to other tasks in the transportation planning for inbound loads.

For an overview of the process, see [Business process: Planning transportation for inbound loads](business-process-planning-transportation-for-inbound-loads.md).
