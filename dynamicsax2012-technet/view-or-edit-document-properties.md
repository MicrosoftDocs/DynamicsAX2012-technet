# View or edit document properties [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Document properties can include the following:

  - The file name.

  - The name of the person who loaded the document into Microsoft Dynamics AX. This property is also called Created by.

  - The date that the document was loaded into Microsoft Dynamics AX. This property is also called Creation date.

  - A description of the document or note.

  - The document type.

  - The file extension, such as .doc.

  - Restrictions on the availability of the attachment. The document can be available either to internal users or to both internal and external users. Internal users are direct employees of your organization. External users are vendors, contract employees, or customers. Internal users can view documents that have internal and external restrictions. External users can only view documents that have external restrictions.

You can use the **Record** page to modify the document's properties. For example, you can add details to the document description or change the restrictions.

1.  Select a record, and then click **Attachments**.

2.  In the list, determine which document or note you want to view the properties for, and then click the link in the **Description** column.

3.  To modify the document's properties, click **Actions** \> **Edit selected item**. An editable version of the **Record** page is displayed. On this page, you can change the description or restriction, or modify the text of a note. For more information, see [Attach documents, notes, or URLs to records](attach-documents-notes-or-urls-to-records.md).
    

    > [!WARNING]
    > <P>For URL attachments, you can only modify the description and URL of the document. However, because the document is stored outside Microsoft Dynamics AX, you cannot change the document itself.</P>



4.  Click **OK**.
