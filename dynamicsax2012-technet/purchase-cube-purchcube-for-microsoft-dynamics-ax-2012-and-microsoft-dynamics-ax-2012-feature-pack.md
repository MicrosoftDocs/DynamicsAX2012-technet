# Purchase cube (PurchCube) for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 and Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use the Purchase cube to report on purchase transactions.

## Units of measure and reporting with the Purchase cube

When working with Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services reports that display a quantity of an item, the appropriate unit of measure must be incorporated into the report to make sure that the quantity is correct, instead of just presenting a SUM value.

For example, the InventTrans.QTY field is expressed in the inventory unit of measure. The inventory unit of measure is stored in the InventTableModule table in Microsoft Dynamics AX for each item number. Each item number has three records with different values that represent the unit of measure (ModuleType): Sales, Inventory, and Purchase. For this purpose, use the UnitID where the ModuleType equals Inventory.

For the Quantity measure that uses the purchase unit of measure, slicing on the Units dimension separates the quantities by unit of measure.

## Configuration keys

The following configuration keys are required to use all features of the Purchase cube:

  - General ledger (LedgerBasic)

  - Trade (LogisticsBasic)

  - Charges (Markup)

  - Price/discount (PriceDisc)

  - Product dimension – size (EcoResProductSize)

  - Product dimension – color (EcoResProductColor)

  - Product dimension – configuration (Config)

## Tables and views

The Purchase cube uses data from the following tables and views:

  - InventBuyerGroup table

  - VendInvoiceJour table

  - InventTableExpanded view

  - LogisticsPostalAddressExpanded view

  - VendInvoiceTransExpanded view

  - VendPackingSlipTransExpanded view

  - VendTableCube view
