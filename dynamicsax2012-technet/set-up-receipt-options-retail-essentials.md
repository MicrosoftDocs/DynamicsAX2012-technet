# Set up receipt options (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to set up receipt options. You can specify receipt options for all customers and for specific customers who have been added to the **Customers** form. Receipts can be printed, sent in email messages, or both printed and sent in email messages. Customers can also choose receipt options at the point of sale (POS).

If you select either email receipts or both printed receipts and email receipts, you must also specify the receipt profile that is used to send the email receipts.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Retail essentials, the forms that you use to complete these tasks might include a subset of the controls that are available for other configurations of Retail. If a topic about these forms describes controls that you don't see, it may be because you’re using Retail essentials.</P>
