Before you travel for business and incur expenses that you charge to your organization, you may be required to create and submit a travel requisition. The travel requisition contains information about the projected costs of your travel. The expense costs that you enter in a travel requisition do not have to be exact. You only have to enter an estimate of the expense costs that you may incur.
