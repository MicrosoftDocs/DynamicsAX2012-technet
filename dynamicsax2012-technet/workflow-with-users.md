# Workflow with users 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The following figure shows an example of a workflow for an expense report. The workflow includes elements that are assigned to specific users.

![Workflow with elements that are assigned to users](images/Gg751362.Workflow_User(AX.60).gif "Workflow with elements that are assigned to users")

To understand how a document moves through this workflow, assume that Sam has submitted an expense report totaling USD 7,000 and has routed his receipts to Ivan. In this scenario, Ivan must review the receipts that Sam routed to him. After Ivan has finished reviewing the receipts, Frank and Sue must approve the expense report.

Because the total amount is not more than USD 10,000, Ann does not have to approve the expense report. Therefore, after Sue approves the expense report, the workflow ends.
