# Eliminate transactions 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The elimination functionality lets you create elimination transactions in a legal entity that is specified as the destination legal entity for eliminations, also referred to as the elimination legal entity. Elimination journals can be generated during the consolidation process or by using an elimination journal proposal.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>We recommend that you use Management Reporter for Microsoft Dynamics AX to combine the financial results for multiple legal entities in a consolidated format. Management Reporter lets you create consolidated financial reports across legal entities, use Microsoft Excel to import consolidation data from other sources, and translate amounts into any number of reporting currencies without having to run the consolidation process in Microsoft Dynamics AX.</P>
> <P>For more information about how to consolidate transactions by using Management Reporter, see <A href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=389548">Financial consolidations and currency translation</A>.</P>
