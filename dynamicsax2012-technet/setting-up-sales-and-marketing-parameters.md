# Setting up Sales and marketing parameters 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Before you begin working in the **Sales and marketing** area of Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can set default values in the **Sales and marketing parameters** form. By presetting these values, you can reduce some of the manual data entry that you must perform when you create new prospects, leads, opportunities, or records in the global address book that share common characteristics.

Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Setup** \> **Sales and marketing parameters**.

## General

You can set the default values for prospects, period codes, and contacts. You can also set customers and vendors for qualified leads to be created automatically, and specify when opportunity records are created.

## Documents

You can set the default values that specify where the files for mailing address documents are stored, and how document types are classified in e-mail messages that are received, sent, and saved. You can also set the length of time that documents are displayed in the documents list.

## Campaigns

You can set the default values for your campaign status, type, groups, and targets. In the **Days campaign expires** field, set the number of days until the campaign expires. Be aware that the total number of campaign days is always the number that you enter plus 1. The campaign start date is not counted in your expiration days. Instead, the start date is counted in the length of the campaign.

## Activities

You can set the default values that are used to create activity categories, types, purposes, and phases for campaigns, quotations, and telemarketing. If you set these values, activities can be created automatically when records are created.

## Transaction log

You can select the entities that you want to include to track transactions. You can also select the type of transactions that you want to include. You can also set the length of time that logged transactions are stored.

## Telephony

You can set the telephony activities and any prefix numbers that are required to make an outgoing telephone call from your company.

## Number sequences

You can set the number sequences. These codes are used with the corresponding references when new records for prospects are created.
