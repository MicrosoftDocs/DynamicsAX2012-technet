# What's New: Master data management 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

Master Data Management (MDM) is a new feature in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 that lets you create and maintain master data records that can be used by multiple AX 2012 R3 instances. Master data is managed by exporting updated data from a participating Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 instance to a central data store, which in turn synchronizes the updated data with all of the other participating Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 instances. Maintaining master data ensures consistency in important information, such as customer and product data, that is shared across your instances. Out of the box, MDM supports synchronization of the Customers, Vendors, Employees, Global Address Book, and Product entities, and allows synchronization of additional entities through customization.

To use MDM, you must also install the Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012Â Data Import/Export Framework and SQL Server Master Data Services. For more information on Master Data Management, see [Master Data Management in Microsoft Dynamics AX](master-data-management-in-microsoft-dynamics-ax.md).
