# Create a custom configuration project and specify base information in RapidStart Services 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Beginning October 1, 2015, RapidStart services will no longer be supported. For more information, see the announcement on CustomerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/northamerica/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued or PartnerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/news-events/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued.

When you configure Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 by using Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services, you can use just use just a basic set of default settings that are provided by Microsoft to set some basic financial options. Alternatively, you can start with a more robust deployment of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 that uses options and data that are specific to your organization. In this case, you can use the full capabilities of RapidStart Services to customize the configuration data that you load into Microsoft Dynamics AX. You use this option when you want to configure settings for one or more business processes or modules. You also use this option when you have added solutions to Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 that were developed by partners or independent software vendors (ISVs), and you want to additional content to support these solutions.

As the Customer administrator for your organization, when you use customized settings, you choose questions that business experts in your company must answer. The input from these business experts is then included in a configuration file that you load into your implementation of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012.

Use the procedures in this topic to create a custom configuration project for your company.
