The external product number can be set up for a specific vendor. This product number can include the combinations of all variants that are available for an item.

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Product/order creation** \> **Vendor's product numbers**.

2.  In the **External item descriptions** form, select an external item number, or click **New** to create a new item number.

3.  In the **External item number** field, enter the vendor’s identifier for the product.
