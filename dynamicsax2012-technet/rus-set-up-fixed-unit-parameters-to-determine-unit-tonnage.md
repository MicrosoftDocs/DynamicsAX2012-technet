In the **Units** form, you can define the ton unit of measure as a fixed unit of measure. This parameter is required to determine tonnage when you generate and print a transportation invoice and a job ticket that are based on a bill of lading. For more information, see [(RUS) About transportation invoices and job tickets that are based on bills of lading](rus-about-transportation-invoices-and-job-tickets-that-are-based-on-bills-of-lading.md).

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Units** \> **Units**.

2.  Select the unit for tons.

3.  Select the **Fixed unit assignment** check box.

4.  In the **Fixed unit** field, select **Metric tons**.
