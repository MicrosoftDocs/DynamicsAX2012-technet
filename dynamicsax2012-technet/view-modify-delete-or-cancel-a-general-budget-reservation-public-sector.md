## Modify a general budget reservation

Use this procedure to make changes to a general budget reservation.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If the reservation is in workflow, recall the workflow status to <STRONG>Draft</STRONG> status, follow the steps below, and then resubmit the amended reservation to workflow.
