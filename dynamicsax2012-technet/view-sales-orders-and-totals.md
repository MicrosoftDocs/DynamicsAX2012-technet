# View sales orders and totals 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use the **All sales orders** and **View sales order** pages to view information about the sales orders that have been created for customers. Sales orders are created to register the sale of goods or services to customers, and to approve, track, and process shipments to customers.

When you view sales orders, you can view the status, which indicates how far the order has progressed in the sales order cycle:

  - **Open order** – The sales order was created.

  - **Delivered** – All order lines have been delivered to the customer.

  - **Invoiced** – All order lines have been invoiced.

  - **Canceled** – All order lines have been canceled; all quantities have been returned, and a credit note has been updated and closed.

You can use the **View totals** page to view various totals for a specific sales order, such as the total weight of the items, and total discounts, taxes, and miscellaneous charges, and invoice amounts. The totals only display the remaining amount that is not invoiced. If a sales order is fully invoiced, then the total is zero.
