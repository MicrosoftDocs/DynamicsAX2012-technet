# Define invoice totals matching tolerances for vendors 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Sometimes a variance exists between the total amounts on an invoice and the total amounts that you expected, based on the corresponding purchase order. You can use invoice totals matching to help make sure that this variance is within an acceptable tolerance.

The default tolerance for invoice totals matching is specified in the **Accounts payable parameters** form. You can specify tolerances for individual vendors that override the default tolerance.

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Setup** \> **Invoice matching** \> **Invoice totals tolerances**.

2.  Select a vendor account.

3.  Enter the variance percentage that you will accept for this vendor.

4.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 for additional vendors, and then close the form.
