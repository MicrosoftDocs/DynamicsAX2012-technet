# (RUS) Generate deferrals by using the periodic process 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use the **Deferrals creating** form to automatically generate deferrals by using the periodic process. Before you can generate deferrals by using the periodic process, you must create and post vendor invoices. For more information, see [(RUS) Deferrals creating (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj839648\(v=ax.60\))Â [(RUS) Purchase orders (modified form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj733294\(v=ax.60\)) .

When you generate deferrals by using the periodic process for vendor invoices, deferral transaction vouchers are created that have a transaction type of **Receipt**.

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Periodic** \> **Deferrals** \> **Deferrals creating**.

2.  Select the line that includes the counter that you have set up, and then click **Calculate marked**. For more information, see [(RUS) Set up calculation sequences and counters](rus-set-up-calculation-sequences-and-counters.md).

3.  Enter the required details, and then click **OK**.

4.  Click **OK** to create a deferral voucher that has a transaction type of **Receipt**.

5.  Click **General ledger** \> **Common** \> **Deferrals**. To view the transaction details in the **Deferrals transactions** form, click **Deferrals models** \> **Transactions**.
