# Record a returned loan item 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

To ensure proper tracking of loaned items, you must update a loaned item record to indicate when the loaned item was actually returned. Use the following procedure to record a returned loan item.

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Periodic** \> **Workers** \> **Loaned equipment**.

2.  Select the line that displays the name of the person who returned an item and the item that was borrowed. If a person has borrowed more than one item, the person’s name is displayed multiple times.

3.  In the **Actual return** field, enter the date when the item was returned.
