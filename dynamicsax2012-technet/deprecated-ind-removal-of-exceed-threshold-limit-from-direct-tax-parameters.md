# Deprecated: (IND) Removal of 'Exceed threshold limit' from Direct Tax parameters 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

For Indian installations, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009 includes a country-specific setup in the general ledger parameters. This feature lets users configure the system behavior when the Direct Tax (Tax Deducted at Source \[TDS\]/Tax Collected at Source \[TCS\]) threshold is exceeded for the first time. The system can have no response, issue a warning, or issue an error that prevents further progress.
