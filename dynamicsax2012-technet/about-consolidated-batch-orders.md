# About consolidated batch orders 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In process manufacturing, you use consolidated batch orders to group one or multiple batch orders that produce a bulk item and one or multiple packed items. A bulk item is a parent item, and a packed item is a child item. The packed items can be packaged in a single container or else in multiple containers that are considered as one unit. When you consolidate orders, you can view all of the related batch orders in a single form to help you determine any remaining work that must be completed.

A consolidated batch order can contain any combination of the following orders:

  - One or multiple bulk orders and one or multiple related packed orders. For example: a single bulk order and multiple packed orders; multiple bulk orders and multiple packed orders; or multiple bulk orders and a single packed order.

  - Only packed orders.

To manage consolidated batch orders and their associated bulk and packed orders, you use the **Consolidated batch orders** form. You can also use this form to set up consolidated orders manually. Click **Production control** \> **Common** \> **Consolidated batch orders**.

When you set up a consolidated batch order, you must convert packed formula items to their bulk items by using a specified conversion factor. To set up and run this conversion, use the **Bulk item conversion** form. Click **Inventory management** \> **Setup** \> **Formula** \> **Bulk item conversion**.

You firm and consolidate batch orders in the **Planned orders** form by using the **Firm and Consolidate** button. Click **Master planning** \> **Common** \> **Planned orders**. You can firm individual orders or multiple orders.
