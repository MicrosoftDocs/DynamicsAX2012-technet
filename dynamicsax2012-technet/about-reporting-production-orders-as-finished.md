# About reporting production orders as finished 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The production stages Release, Start, and Report as finished are a part of actual production control. These stages direct or control the movement of goods through the complete manufacturing cycle, from the requisitioning of raw materials to the delivery of finished products.

You can raise a production order to the status **Report as finished** through the standard production order update function or through the production journal **Report as finished**. From the journal, you can update several productions at the same time by selecting and posting them all. If **End job** has been selected, the status of all production orders included in this process is changed to **Report as finished**.

## Reporting some of the items in the production order as finished

You can report that only some of the items in the production order are finished. If you report part of a production order as finished, resources are made available for other production tasks. If you report a production order as finished through the update function, you can receive information about the quantity of items already produced and the number of units produced in error. Therefore, you know what has already been posted and how much is still missing.
