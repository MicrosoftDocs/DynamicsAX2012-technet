# Reverse a transaction 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The transaction reversal process reverses the original transaction and all related transactions that were created when the original transaction was posted. Before you reverse a transaction for the first time, select a number sequence for the **Transaction reversal** and **Trace number** references in the **Number sequences** area of the **General ledger parameters** form.

## About reversing transactions

The following requirements apply when you reverse transactions:

  - You must perform the reversal where the transaction originated. For example, you cannot reverse from General ledger if the transaction originated in Accounts payable.

  - You must reverse transactions in the correct sequential order. For example, if you applied a cash receipt to a **Disposal - sale** transaction, you must reverse the receipt settlement before you reverse the **Disposal - sale** transaction.

## Reversals that affect fixed assets

The following additional requirements apply when you reverse a transaction that affects a fixed asset:

  - For **Provision for reserve**, **Transfer from reserve**, or **Disposal - sale** type reversals, the fixed asset must have a status of **Open** or **Sold**. For **Disposal - scrap** type reversals, the fixed asset must have a status of **Open** or **Scrapped**. For all other asset reversals, the asset involved in the transaction must have a status of **Open**.

  - You can reverse the transfer of a fixed asset if it is the most recent transfer of the fixed asset. You cannot reverse a transfer that occurred before the most recent transfer, and you cannot reverse a transfer that has already been reversed. For more information, see [Transfer fixed assets](transfer-fixed-assets.md).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Fixed asset transaction reversals reset fixed asset field values to their previous values. For example, an asset status might be reset from <STRONG>Open</STRONG> to <STRONG>Not yet acquired</STRONG>, or the <STRONG>Depreciation periods</STRONG> field might be reset from <STRONG>119</STRONG> to <STRONG>120</STRONG>.</P>
