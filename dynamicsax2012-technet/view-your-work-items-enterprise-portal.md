# View your work items (Enterprise Portal) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can view the work items assigned to you in the **Work list** Web part. If your organization uses Role Centers, the **Work list** Web part is displayed on your Role Center, which you can view by clicking **Home** on the top link bar. You can also add this Web part to other pages.

The work items assigned to you may require that you:

  - Complete a task related to a document that was submitted for processing.

  - Approve a document.

  - Make a decision that determines the next step of the workflow.
