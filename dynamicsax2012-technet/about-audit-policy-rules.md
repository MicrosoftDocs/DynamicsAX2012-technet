# About audit policy rules 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use audit policies to evaluate expense reports, vendor invoices, and purchase orders to make sure that they comply with policy rules that you create. All of the rules that are associated with an audit policy are run in batch mode, according to a schedule that you specify.

Each policy rule is an instance of a policy rule type. For each policy rule type, only one policy rule can be active at a time.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic includes information about features that were added or changed for cumulative update 6 or later for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2. This information also applies to AX 2012 R3.</P>



## Queries and query types

When you create an audit policy rule, you first select a policy rule type. The policy rule type specifies the Application Object Tree (AOT) query to use as the starting point for creating the policy rule. It also specifies the query type to use for the policy rule.

The query determines the source document that the policy rule evaluates. It also specifies the fields in the source document that identify both the legal entity and the date to use when documents are selected for audit.

The query type controls the default fields in the query form and in the **Audit policy rule** form.

The following table shows the query types that are available for audit policy rules.
