# Create absence journals 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Absence journals contain absence registrations for a specific worker for a specific period of time. Before you can register an absence for a worker, you must create an absence journal for the worker.

When you create absence journals, the starting date immediately follows the ending date for the previous absence period for a worker. When you create the first absence journal for a worker, the starting date is the absence date that is specified on the **Worker** form for the worker.

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Periodic** \> **Absence** \> **Create absence journals**.

2.  Click **Select**.

3.  In the **Create absence journals** inquiry form, modify the inquiry criteria to identify the workers to create absence journals for, and then click **OK**. For more information, see [Inquiry (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa575929\(v=ax.60\)).

4.  Enter an ending date for the period to create absence journals for. For example, to create six absence journals for a worker whose absence periods are one month long, you can select an ending date that is six months from todayâ€™s date.

5.  Click **OK**.
