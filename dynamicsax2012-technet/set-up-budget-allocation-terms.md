# Set up budget allocation terms 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use the **Budget allocation terms** form to define the financial dimension values and the percentages that are used to generate budget allocations. These budget allocation terms provide an automated way to distribute percentages of budget amounts across financial dimension values. For example, a travel budget can be allocated to multiple departments by using one budget account entry.

Starting with cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, you can also use ledger allocation rules for budget plans. For more information, see [About allocation rules](about-allocation-rules.md) and [Create an allocation rule](create-an-allocation-rule.md).

1.  Click **Budgeting** \> **Setup** \> **Basic budgeting** \> **Budget allocation terms**.

2.  Click **New**, and then enter an identifier and a description for the budget allocation term.

3.  Click **Add**, and then enter the percentage of the total amount that is allocated.
    
    You can create a copy of an existing allocation term for this budget allocation term. Click **Copy** to select the existing allocation term.

4.  Click the percentage, and then select a value for one or more financial dimensions.

5.  Repeat steps 2 through 4 for each budget allocation term that you have to set up.
