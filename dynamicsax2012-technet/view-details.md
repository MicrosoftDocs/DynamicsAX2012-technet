Some fields have source forms that contain the values that are the possible selections for that field. You can right-click in some fields and select **View details** to open a source form where the values that are available for the selected field are maintained.

In the source form that opens, you can add or modify records, and the changes are then reflected throughout the system. This information can be useful when a selection that you need is not available for a field, and it is necessary to update the source form for that field.

For example, in the **Create sales order** form, right-click the **Customer account** field and select **View details** to open the **Customers** form.
