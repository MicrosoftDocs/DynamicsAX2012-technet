# About project category groups 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Categories represent types of costs or revenues that are defined for an entire organization. Each category must be assigned to a category group. Categories and category groups are organized by type. These types correspond to the transaction types that are available in Project management and accounting.

Before a worker can submit project timesheet hours for a particular category, their worker profile must be associated with that category in the **Worker/category validation groups** form.

You can use project category groups for several purposes:

  - Group similar cost categories, such as worker hours, materials, and travel expenses.

  - Set up default ledger posting by category group.

  - Set up line properties by category group.

Category groups are divided into four types:

  - **Fee**

  - **Hour**

  - **Expense**

  - **Item**

Categories that are attached to a category group must be of the same type as the category group.

The benefit of dividing category groups and their corresponding categories into types is that when you select a category on a transaction line, the categories that are available for selection are limited to the category types that are defined for the transaction. For example, if you enter an expense transaction, the categories that you can select for this transaction are limited to expense type categories.
