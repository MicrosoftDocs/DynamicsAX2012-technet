You can use the **Edit external description** page to modify the external description of an item. The external description consists of text that describes the item and an alternative item number. Multiple external item descriptions can be set up for each item.

Vendors can also modify the external description of an item if they are the primary suppliers of the item. For more information, see [View or edit your supplied products information](view-or-edit-your-supplied-products-information.md).

1.  Click **Procurement** on the top link bar, and then click **Released products** on the Quick Launch. The **Released products** page is displayed.

2.  Select the item that you want to change. On the **Action Pane**, on the **Purchase** tab, in the **Related information** group, click **External item description**. The **Edit external description** page is displayed.

3.  Enter the external item number and the description that you want to associate with the selected item.

4.  Click **Save and close** to save the changes and return to the **Released products** list page. The new information now becomes available when you view details about this item.
