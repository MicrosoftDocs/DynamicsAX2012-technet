# Setting up payroll: Advanced topics 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


Some elements of Payroll are more complicated to set up than others. This section contains information to help you set up the most complex elements.

For basic setup instructions, see [Setting up payroll: Basic topics](setting-up-payroll-basic-topics.md).

## Set up premium codes and policies

Premium earnings are extra earnings that are paid to workers when specified conditions are met. For example, you might offer a differential for hours worked on the second or third shifts, overtime premiums, or additional pay to workers who hold a specialized certification.

To define the earning codes, premium codes, premium policies, and other payroll entities that you need to calculate and pay the premium earnings that your organization provides, see [Premium earning setup tasks](premium-earning-setup-tasks.md).

If your organization does not offer any premium earnings, you don’t have to complete any of the premium earning setup tasks.

## Set up garnishments and tax levies

Garnishments and tax levies are created and managed by using the benefit framework. This framework helps make sure that the payroll impact of garnishments and tax levies is handled correctly.

To set up garnishments and tax levies, see [Garnishment and tax levy setup tasks](garnishment-and-tax-levy-setup-tasks.md).

To enroll a worker in a garnishment or tax levy, see [Garnishment and tax levy enrollment tasks](garnishment-and-tax-levy-enrollment-tasks.md).

If you have any more questions about garnishments and tax levies, see [Garnishments, tax levies, and administrative fees](garnishments-tax-levies-and-administrative-fees.md), or contact your legal advisors.
