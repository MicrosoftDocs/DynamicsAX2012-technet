# Configure database connections for a POS register by using the Retail Channel Configuration Utility 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

The Retail Channel Configuration Utility (formerly named Retail Store Database Utility) can be used to configure database connections for a point of sale (POS) or Retail Modern POS register. This utility can also be used to install both a channel database and a POS register on the same computer, so that the database and register can be used in a development environment.

You must install the Retail Channel Configuration Utility on each computer where you want to use it. Use the Setup wizard for Microsoft Dynamics AX to install the utility. For more information, see [Install the Retail Channel Configuration Utility (Retail Store Database Utility)](install-the-retail-channel-configuration-utility-retail-store-database-utility.md).

The procedures in this topic assume that you have installed a supported version of Microsoft SQL Server on the computer where you plan to run the Retail Channel Configuration Utility. For a list of operating systems and SQL Server versions that are supported, see the [Microsoft Dynamics AX system requirements](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=165377).

The Retail Channel Configuration Utility can also be used to install a channel database on a shared database server or an offline database on a POS computer. For more information, see [Create a channel database or an offline database (AX 2012 R3)](create-a-channel-database-or-an-offline-database-ax-2012-r3.md) or [Create a store database or an offline database (AX 2012 R2 and AX 2012 Feature Pack)](create-a-store-database-or-an-offline-database-ax-2012-r2-and-ax-2012-feature-pack.md).

## Configure a database connection for a POS register (AX 2012 R3)

Complete the following procedure to configure the channel database connection for a POS register. To log on to Microsoft Dynamics AX for Retail POS, the register must have access to the channel database.

For information about additional parameters for POS registers, see [Set up registers](set-up-registers.md).

1.  On a POS computer, start the Retail Channel Configuration Utility.

2.  Click **Configure Retail POS and Retail Offline Sync Service**.

3.  In the **Identification** section of the form, complete the information in the following fields:

## Configure a channel database and a POS register on a single computer

You can install Retail components on a single computer for development. In this case, you must run the Retail Channel Configuration Utility two times, in the following order, to install both a channel database and a POS register.

1.  In AX 2012 R3, create the channel database as described in the topic [Create a channel database or an offline database (AX 2012 R3)](create-a-channel-database-or-an-offline-database-ax-2012-r3.md). In AX 2012 R2, create the store database as described in the topic [Create a store database or an offline database (AX 2012 R2 and AX 2012 Feature Pack)](create-a-store-database-or-an-offline-database-ax-2012-r2-and-ax-2012-feature-pack.md).

2.  Configure the POS register, as described earlier in this topic.
