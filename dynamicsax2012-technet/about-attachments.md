# About attachments 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can attach documents such as e-mail messages, faxes, and Microsoft Office system documents to Microsoft Dynamics AX records. However, your administrator must first configure document types and categories by using the Microsoft Dynamics AX client. If you attempt to attach a document to a record in Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX, and the document type is not configured, you receive an error.

Microsoft Dynamics AX supports two types of document attachments:

  - You can attach a document or note to a record as a physical attachment. These attachments are stored in the Microsoft Dynamics AX database, and you and other users can view the records in both Enterprise Portal and the Microsoft Dynamics AX client.

  - You can attach a document by reference by using a URL. URL attachments are used by businesses or organizations that store digital images of physical documents in a document management system or on a Web server.

When you attach a document or note, you specify internal or external viewing restrictions. If a document or note is **Internal**, only direct employees of your organization who have permission to view that record can view the attached notes or documents.

If a document or note is **External**, any internal or external user who has permission to view that record can also view the attached notes or documents. The internal and external users include direct employees, contract employees, vendors, and customers.

You can attach multiple documents or notes to a single record. All documents and notes for a record are listed on the **Attachments** page for the selected record. For more information, see [Attach documents, notes, or URLs to records](attach-documents-notes-or-urls-to-records.md) and [View attachments](view-attachments.md).
