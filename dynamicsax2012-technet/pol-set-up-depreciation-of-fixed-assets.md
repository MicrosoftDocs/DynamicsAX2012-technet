# (POL) Set up depreciation of fixed assets 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

In Poland, fixed asset depreciation methods differ from the standard depreciation methods. Additional rules and settings are used to meet specific fixed asset accounting requirements. According to Polish regulations, a yearly depreciation rate is used to calculate depreciation, instead of the **Straight line service life** or **Straight line life remaining** depreciation methods. The following depreciation methods are applied in Poland:

  - **Reducing balance (Poland)**

  - **Straight line (Poland)**

  - **Straight line percentage (Poland)**


> [!NOTE]
> <P>For more information about depreciation methods, see "Depreciation methods and conventions" in Application user Help.</P>
