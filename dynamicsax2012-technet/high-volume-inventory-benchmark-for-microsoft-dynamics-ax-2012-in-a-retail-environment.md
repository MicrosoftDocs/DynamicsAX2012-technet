# High Volume Inventory Benchmark for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 in a Retail Environment 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Microsoft Corporation conducted a benchmark to simulate an inventory workload with more than 4.96 million transaction lines. The goal of the benchmark was to simulate three types of core inventory transactions and demonstrate that Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 can effectively handle very high volumes of transactions. The inventory transactions simulated the import of point of sale (POS) transactions for a large retail chain into Microsoft Dynamics AX.

Another goal of the benchmark was to demonstrate that Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 can provide up-to-date inventory information on an hourly basis by using standard functionality. The benchmark results demonstrate that Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 can successfully process more than 55 million transaction lines aggregated to 3.68 million inventory adjustment journal lines. The benchmark also creates and posts more than 1 million transfer order lines and more than 90 thousand item arrival lines.

We have published the following two papers about the high volume inventory benchmark:
