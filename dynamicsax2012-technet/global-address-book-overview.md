The global address book can help you understand the relationships among people and organizations that are associated with your organization. For example, a customer may also be a vendor in a marketing campaign, or a worker in your organization may also be a vendor.

A party is a person or organization that is either internal or external to your organization. Each party has its own record. You can enter party records in the global address book in the following ways:

  - Create a party record when you do not know the entity type – When you create a party record and you do not know the entity type, for example you do not know if the entity is a customer or an opportunity, you create the record in the global address book. You can select the entity type later.

  - Create a party record when you know the entity type – If you know the entity type for the party, you can create a record in the applicable form for that type. For example, for a customer, you create a record in the **Customer** form. When you create and save a record by using the applicable form, the record is automatically created in the global address book.
