# Set up permission groups and operations (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to link permissions to operations that can be performed at the point of sale (POS). Operations are the tasks that a staff member can perform. Every time that a staff member performs an operation in Retail essentials, a series of checks is performed to determine whether the staff member has permission to perform the operation.

You use the **Operations** form to link a permission to an operation. Each permission is typically linked to one operation. However, you can also link a single permission to multiple operations. Staff members can be assigned to POS permission groups. Permissions for staff members can be modified after the staff members are assigned to a POS permission group.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Retail essentials, the forms that you use to complete these tasks might include only a subset of the controls that are available for other configurations of Retail. If a topic about these forms describes controls that you don't see, it may be because you’re using Retail essentials.</P>



## Set up a POS permission group

1.  Click **Retail essentials** \> **Employees** \> **Permission groups**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a new permission group. Then, enter an ID number and a description for the POS permission group.

3.  On the **Permissions** FastTab, select the check box for each permission to assign.

4.  Specify the maximum discount amounts and percentages.

5.  Select the type of price override to allow.

## Set up operations

1.  Click **Retail essentials** \> **Channels** \> **Setup** \> **POS** \> **Operations**.

2.  In the **Operations** form, select an existing operation. Alternatively, click **New** to add a new operation, and then enter an ID number and a name for the operation.

3.  In the **Permission ID** column, select the permissions to link the operation to.

4.  In the **Check user access** column, select the check box to indicate that Retail essentials checks a user's permissions before the operation is performed.

5.  In the **User operation** column, select the check box to indicate that the operation can be used.
