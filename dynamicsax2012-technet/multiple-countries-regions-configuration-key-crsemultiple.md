# Multiple countries/regions configuration key (CRSEMultiple) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Country/region configuration keys have been deprecated in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. As a result, the features that previously were controlled by the configuration keys that are described in the following topics are now controlled by the country/region context. See the following topics for a list of the countries/regions where these features are enabled:

  - [Credit invoicing configuration key (CustVendCreditInvoicing)](credit-invoicing-configuration-key-custvendcreditinvoicing.md)

  - [Data export configuration key (DataExport)](data-export-configuration-key-dataexport.md)

  - [Full settlement configuration key (FullSettlement)](full-settlement-configuration-key-fullsettlement.md)

  - [Multiple interest rates configuration key (CustMultipleInterestRates)](multiple-interest-rates-configuration-key-custmultipleinterestrates.md)

  - [Unrealized sales tax configuration key (TaxUnrealized)](unrealized-sales-tax-configuration-key-taxunrealized.md)

For more information, see [Country/Regional specific features configuration key (CRSECountry)](country-regional-specific-features-configuration-key-crsecountry.md).
