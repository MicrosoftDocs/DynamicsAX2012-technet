A new line with a status of **Honored** and a sequence number of 1 or higher is created for the remitted bill of exchange and is shown in the **Bill of exchange journal** inquiry form.

When you settle a bill of exchange that is remitted for discount, the liabilities for discount account is debited and the remit for discount account is credited. When you settle a bill of exchange that is remitted for collection, the ledger account for the bank that is used is debited, and the remit for collection account is credited.
