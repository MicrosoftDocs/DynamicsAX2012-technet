## 1\. Create tax registration numbers and insurance fund information for a legal entity

You can create the tax registration details and insurance fund details for a legal entity. Legal entities are required to register in insurance funds. If the hired employee is eligible for social allowances and pension provision, then the employer becomes an insurant, and the employer must contribute to the social and pension insurance funds. These insurance identification numbers are considered to be legal entity registration codes for the local subsidiaries of insurers.

To create social insurance details, pension fund numbers, and registration numbers for the legal entity, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Organization** \> **Legal entities**.

2.  On the **Additional registration** FastTab, in the **Registration code in FSS** field, enter the registration code for the federal social insurance fund.

3.  In the **Territorial authority of the insurer** field, select the code for the territorial authority of the insurer, or the local subsidiary of the social insurance fund.

4.  In the **Code of subordination** field, enter the subordination code of the local subsidiary of the social insurance fund.

5.  In the **Registration pension fund number** field, enter the registration pension fund number.

6.  To open the **Manage addresses** form, click **Taxes**.

7.  To add the tax registration information for the legal entity, on the **Tax registration** FastTab, click **Add**.

8.  In the **Registration type** field, select the tax registration type that is specified by the tax authorities. The following registration types are available:
    
      - OGRN - The unique code for the legal entity in the Russian federation.
    
      - OKDP – The special code that is assigned to the company based on the business.
    
      - INN ORG – The unique identification code for the individual taxpayer.
    
      - KPP - The code that is provided by the tax authority during the registration.
    
      - OKPO - The code that is assigned to the legal entity from the list of Russian professional organizations.

9.  In the **Registration number** field, enter the registration number for the legal entity that is specified by the tax authorities.

10. In the **Organizational-legal form** field, enter the legal entity’s type of incorporation.

## 2\. Create a branch

You can create a branch to identify groups of departments as individual taxpayers. These branches that you create can also be used by the **Fixed assets** module for functions that are separate from the payroll process. You can create or update a branch in the **Separate divisions** form.

To create a branch, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Separate divisions**.

2.  Click **New** to create a new branch.

3.  In the **Separate division ID** field, enter the identification code for the branch.

4.  In the **Vendor account** field, select the vendor account that is associated with the branch.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The name of the vendor is automatically displayed in the <STRONG>Name</STRONG> field.</P>



5.  To indicate that the selected branch can report the tax declarations independently, select the **Independent** check box.

## 3\. Create a department and assign it to a branch

You can create departments in an organization, assign a director, and assign a person in charge for the department in the **Organization** form.

To create a department and assign it to a branch, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Staff administration** \> **Structure** \> **Organization**.
    
    –or–

2.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Setup** \> **Department** \> **Organization**.

3.  Press CTRL+N to create a new department in the organizational structure.

4.  On the **Overview** tab, in the **Department code** field, enter a code for the department.

5.  In the **Description** field, enter a description for the department.

6.  In the **Person in charge** field, select the code for the employee who is responsible for the department. The employees who are already part of this department are available for selection.

7.  On the **General** FastTab, in the **Director** field, select the code of the employee who leads the department. The registered workers of the company are available for selection.

8.  To assign the department to a branch, on the **Branch** FastTab, click **New**.

9.  In the **Start date** field, enter the date when the department is assigned to the branch.

10. In the **Separate division ID** field, select the code of the branch.

To detach a department from a branch, follow these steps:

1.  On the **Branch** FastTab, click **New**, and then in the **Start date** field, enter the date when the department’s assignment to the branch should be completed.

2.  Leave the **Separate division ID** field blank. The department is detached from the branch, and it becomes a part of the legal entity’s head office.

## 4\. Reserve a position for a department

You can reserve a position for a department in the **Organizational chart** form. The head count for the reserved position must be approved by the Human Resources administrator in the **Changing staff list resolution lines** form so that an employee can be hired for the approved position.

To reserve a position for a department, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Staff administration** \> **Structure** \> **Organizational chart**.
