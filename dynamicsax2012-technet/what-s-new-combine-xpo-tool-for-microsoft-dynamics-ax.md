# What's new: Combine XPO Tool for Microsoft Dynamics AX 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Combine XPO Tool, is a command-line program that combines a set of interdependent XPO files into a single XPO file. For example, if a team of developers is making code changes to different aspects of an application, the developers can use this tool to merge the changed files into one XPO file.

As of AX 2012 R2, the Combine XPO Tool is available in the Microsoft Dynamics AX\\60\\Management Utilities folder. (The beta version of the tool is available on Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services).

## November 2014 Update

In November 2014, in an effort to streamline the number of sites that partners and customers need to access, we decommissioned the InformationSource site.

  - The Combine XPO tool has moved to the new Downloadable tools section of Lifecycle Services, which is available in the new preview interface, at the far right. To use the new interface, add V2 to your default URL, using the following pattern:
    
    https://lcs.dynamics.com/V2/ProjectDashboard/yourprojectID
    
    [Go to Lifecycle Services](https://lcs.dynamics.com)

  - The content has moved to CustomerSource. Start [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=518079) to find conference content, whitepapers, datasheets, and how-to videos.
    
    All content on CustomerSource is now indexed by Bing and other external search engines, so you can find content just by searching. You will still be required to log in to access the content.
