# (USA) About working with Commerce Services 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

After you set up an account for Commerce Services for Microsoft Dynamics ERP and set up marketplaces, you can list your products online and process sales orders as customers buy your products. The following steps describe the basic workflow for working with Commerce Services:

1.  In Microsoft Dynamics AX, select the products to sell online, and then synchronize the products with Commerce Services.
    
    For more information, see [(USA) Select products to sell online](usa-select-products-to-sell-online.md).

2.  Organize the items in Commerce Services. For example, you can create categories and catalogs, and add images to products.
    
    For more information, see [(USA) Organize and edit products in Commerce Services](usa-organize-and-edit-products-in-commerce-services.md).

3.  List products and catalogs in online marketplaces, such as eBay, and in online stores that your organization creates.
    
    For more information, see [(USA) List products and catalogs in online marketplaces](usa-list-products-and-catalogs-in-online-marketplaces.md).

4.  Download orders from online marketplaces, and process the orders in Microsoft Dynamics AX. You can download orders on demand. Orders can also be downloaded automatically, based on a synchronization schedule.
    
    For more information, see [(USA) Download orders from online marketplaces](usa-download-orders-from-online-marketplaces.md).

You can also specify some settings for Commerce Services, in both Microsoft Dynamics AX and Commerce Services. For example, in Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can specify category hierarchies and shipping charges. In Commerce Services, you can specify departments and categories, shipping methods, payment providers, and payment methods. For more information, see [(USA) Set up and maintain a Commerce Services account](usa-set-up-and-maintain-a-commerce-services-account.md) and [(USA) Modify Commerce Services settings](usa-modify-commerce-services-settings.md).
