If you will be out of the office for a period of time or will be unavailable to act on work items, you can delegate, or reassign, your work items to another user.

You can configure the system to delegate your work items, or you can manually delegate a specific work item to another user.

      - **Workflow** – Delegate only the work items related to a specific workflow. In the **Name** field, select the specific workflow.

4.  From the **Delegate** list, select the user who you are delegating your work items to.
