# Draw a bill of exchange 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can draw a bill of exchange automatically or in a draw bill of exchange journal. A bill of exchange always is based on an open customer transaction, either a customer invoice for a sales order or a free text invoice.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>When you transfer transactions to a journal, the way that due dates are handled depends on how you select the transactions. Click <STRONG>Accounts receivable</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Journals</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Payments</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Payment journal</STRONG>. Click <STRONG>Lines</STRONG>. You can click <STRONG>Payment proposal</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Create payment proposal</STRONG> to select transactions by using a query to select the total number of payments that are due as of a specific date. If you select transactions by using a payment proposal, the date that you enter in the <STRONG>Total payment date</STRONG> field is used for all transferred transactions. If you select transactions manually in the <STRONG>Settle open transactions</STRONG> form, the latest due date of the selected transactions is used.</P>
