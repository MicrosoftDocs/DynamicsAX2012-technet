You can print fiscal document text at the bottom of a printed fiscal document. The fiscal document text provides additional information about the taxes and laws that are applied to the invoice. To print fiscal document text on a free text invoice, you can attach the fiscal document text to the free text invoice.

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Free text invoices** \> **All free text invoices**.

2.  Double-click a free text invoice or create a free text invoice. For more information, see [(BRA) Create and post a free text invoice](bra-create-and-post-a-free-text-invoice.md).

3.  In the **Free text invoice** form, on the **Action pane**, click **Attachments**, and then click **Fiscal document texts**.

4.  In the **Fiscal document texts** form, create a record to add fiscal document text to the free text invoice.

5.  In the **Text ID** field, select the identifier for the fiscal document source text. The **Description**, **Note**, **Restriction**, **Fiscal information**, **Agency**, and **Reference process number** fields are updated with details of the fiscal document source text in the **Fiscal document source texts** form.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can also modify the details in the <STRONG>Description</STRONG>, <STRONG>Note</STRONG>, <STRONG>Restriction</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Fiscal information</STRONG> fields.
