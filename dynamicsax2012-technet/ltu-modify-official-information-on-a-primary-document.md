# (LTU) Modify official information on a primary document 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Before you generate and post an invoice for a primary document, such as a sales order or a purchase order, you can modify the name and title of the officials who are assigned to the document by default. For example, you can assign a new director, chief accountant, or supplier to the document.

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Sales orders** \> **All sales orders**. Double-click the sales order to modify. In the **Sales order** form, select the sales order line, and then, on the **Action Pane**, on the **Invoice** tab, in the **Generate** group, click **Invoice**.
    
    –or–
    
    Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Common** \> **Purchase orders** \> **All purchase orders**. Double-click the purchase order to modify. In the **Purchase order** form, select the purchase order line, and then, on the **Action Pane**, on the **Invoice** tab, in the **Generate** group, click **Invoice**.

2.  In the **Posting invoice** form, click the **Officials** tab in the lower pane.
    
    By default, the **Employee name** and **Title** fields on the **Officials** tab display the employee name and title that were set up in the **Officials** form. If these details were not set up in the **Officials** form, the fields are blank.
    
    You cannot add or delete position lines in this form.

3.  Select or enter the employee name or title to update the line.

4.  Post the invoice.
    

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > <P>After you post a document, you cannot modify the selected officials. The employee name and job title that you select in this form are used on future primary documents, such as sales orders and purchase orders.</P>
