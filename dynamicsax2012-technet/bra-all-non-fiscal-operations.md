# (BRA) All non fiscal operations 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to create non fiscal document transactions to be included in the Sistema Publico de Escrituração Digital Escrituracao Fiscal Digital (SPED EFD) text file.

The SPED EFD contributions text files are generated by legal entities that already have the obligation to issue Accounting and Fiscal SPED. The text files provide information about transactions that represent the Programa de Integração Social (PIS) and Contribuição para o Financiamento da Seguridade Social (COFINS) taxable and non-taxable revenue, and the cost or expenses with credit of PIS and COFINS. Operations that are not related to fiscal documents, such as rent, or revenue or expenses that are related to operations, must be included in record F100 of the text file.
