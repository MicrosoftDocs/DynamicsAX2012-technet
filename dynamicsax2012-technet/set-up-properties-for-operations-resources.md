# Set up properties for operations resources [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Operations resource properties are special attributes that you can assign to your resources for use in the scheduling process. Properties that you set up can be assigned to working time templates in the **Working time templates** form. For more information, see [Working time templates (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa596796\(v=ax.60\)).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Resource properties are not required when you set up <STRONG>Working times</STRONG> calendars. However, if you want to use properties, it is more efficient to set them up at the same time.</P>



1.  Click **Production control** \> **Setup** \> **Resources** \> **Properties**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a new line.

3.  In the **Property** field, enter an alphanumeric identifier for the property.

4.  In the **Name** field, enter the name of the property.

5.  Click **Values**.

6.  In the **Name** field, enter the name that you assigned to the property in step 4.

7.  In the **Value** field, enter any additional information about the property.
