# Delete a question group in RapidStart Services 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Beginning October 1, 2015, RapidStart services will no longer be supported. For more information, see the announcement on CustomerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/northamerica/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued or PartnerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/news-events/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued.

You can delete a question group if it is no longer needed in Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services. Deleting a question group also deletes all the questions that are associated with it.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You cannot delete a question group that belongs to a published functional area. For information about how to unpublish a functional area, see <A href="unpublish-a-functional-area-in-rapidstart-services.md">Unpublish a functional area in RapidStart Services</A>.</P>



1.  In the RapidStart Services header, click **Design**, and then click **Functional area**.

2.  In the **Functional area** list, select the functional area that contains the question group that you want to delete.

3.  Click the row of the question group that you want to delete.
    

    > [!TIP]
    > <P>Do not click in the <STRONG>Question group name</STRONG> column. Doing so opens the page that is used to create and update questions.</P>



4.  Click the **Question group** button, and then click **Delete question group**.

5.  Click **OK**.
