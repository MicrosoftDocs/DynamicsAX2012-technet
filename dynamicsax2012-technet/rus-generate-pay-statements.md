## 1\. Create and post a payroll journal

Use the **Payroll journal** and **Payroll journal lines** forms to create a payroll journal and payroll journal lines that are used to create non-recurring accruals and deductions for employees. You can use a payroll journal to register payments that are not processed through other type of entries, such as timesheets, vacations, business trips, sick lists, or bonuses. You can also use a payroll journal to make manual adjustments to the values that are automatically calculated for other processes. You can create lines in a journal for specific employees or for groups of employees.

To create and post a payroll journal, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Calculation procedures** \> **Payroll journal** \> **Payroll journal**.

2.  Click **New** or press CTRL+N to create a journal.

3.  In the **Name** field, select the identification code for a payroll journal name.

4.  On the **General** tab, select the **Use rate value per employee** check box to use the date effective rate value that you specified for each employee or group in the **Value** field on the **Overview** tab in the **Set up rate values** form. If you clear this check box, the default rate value that you specified for the rate in the **Value** field on the **Value** tab in the **Rates** form is used for all of the employees or groups.

5.  In the **Number of incentive resolution** field, select the number of the incentive resolution order that is related to the payroll journal. Click **From order** to create journal lines automatically based on the information that is available in the selected incentive resolution, such as the pay type code from the resolution type, or the employees that have incentive amounts from the resolution lines.

6.  Specify values in other fields, if required, and then click **Lines**.

7.  In the **Payroll journal lines** form, click **New** or press CTRL+N to create a payroll journal line, and then specify the line type, pay type, quantity, rate, and amount for the line.

You can click **View the storno** in the **Payroll journal** or **Payroll journal lines** form to inquiry the storno adjustment for the selected payroll journal.

## 2\. Calculate the average wages that are earned by a worker

Use the **Employee average earnings calculation** form to calculate the average earnings of an employee. You can calculate different types of salary accruals using the average earnings method. These can include per diem expenses, travel allowances, gifts, annual bonuses, vacations, and sick lists.

You can use multiple methods to calculate the different average earnings accrual types.

Microsoft Dynamics AX can also calculate the average earnings automatically if you configure it in the counters that are running. For more information about how to set up counters, see “4. (RUS) Set up counters for calculation sequences” in [(RUS) Set up calculation procedures for the payroll process](rus-set-up-calculation-procedures-for-the-payroll-process.md).

To calculate the average wages that are earned by a worker, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Average earnings calculation** \> **Average earnings calculation lines**.

2.  In the **Employee average earnings calculation** form, in the **Reporting period** field, modify the calculation period, if required. This field displays the current calculation period by default

3.  To create a calculation line manually, perform the following steps:
    
    1.  Click **New** or press CTRL+N to create a line.
    
    2.  In the **Calculation method code** field, select the identification code of the calculation method to use for the line.
    
    3.  In the **Employee** field, select the identification code of the employee to calculate average earnings for. You must select an employee for whom you have defined a working schedule.

## 3\. Calculate salaries using calculation procedures

You can calculate salaries that include the payable amounts and the deductions by types of salary, funds, data for medical certificates, and vacations. You can use the data in the working time calculation table, salary journals, and periodic payments according to the configured algorithms or sequences of calculations to calculate the salaries. You can calculate earnings for an employee or all of the employees at once using one or all of the calculation methods.

You can set up the sequence of the calculation procedures in the **Calculation procedures** form.

When you change the input data by entering new pay lines, tables, or medical certificates for a calculation procedure, a message is displayed stating that you must repeat the calculation of all of the dependent procedures. To save calculation time, you can save only the most recent modifications by calculating the pay only for those employees for whom the data have changed.

To calculate salaries using calculation procedures, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Payroll calculation** \> **Procedure calculation**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The form displays a list of all of the calculation procedures that are specified in the module settings, with an indication of their calculation status.</P>



2.  In the **Status** field, the current status of the procedure is displayed. You can modify the status for the procedure. Use the information in the following table to decide the status of the procedure.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><p>Status</p></th>
    <th><p>Purpose</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Not calculated</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>The calculation of the given procedure has not been calculated, or its results are no longer up to date. Modify the status to <strong>Not calculated</strong> when you recalculate the procedure, so that all of the calculations for the procedure and all of the dependent procedures are recalculated.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Calculated</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>The procedure has been fully calculated. This option is updated automatically for the calculated procedure.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Exclude</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>The procedure is excluded from the calculation.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    
    If you change the status of a procedure, the statuses of the child procedures also change. For example, the advance calculation requires a previous vacation payment calculation. When you set the status of the vacation payment calculation procedure to **Not calculated**, the same status is assigned to the advance calculation procedure. In the **Modified date and time** field, the date and time of the last payroll calculation are displayed for the corresponding procedure. The **Modified by** field displays the identification code of the user who ran the last calculation for this procedure.

3.  On the **General** tab, in the **Payment period** and the **Accrual date** fields, the payment period and the accrual date for the current calculation procedure are updated.

4.  Select the **Accrual date - current calculation date** check box to indicate that the date of the current calculation is updated in the calculated payroll lines for the selected calculation procedure.

5.  To process the calculation of a procedure that has a status of **Not calculated**, select the procedure on the **Overview** tab, and then click **Calculation**. Specify the criteria, and then click **OK**.
    
    Alternatively, to process calculations for all of the procedures that have a status of **Not calculated**, click **Calculate all**.

6.  Click **Payroll lines** to open the **Payments and deductions registration** form, where you can view the results of the calculation of the current procedure.

## 4\. Verify worker payments and deductions

Use the **Payments and deductions registration** form to verify payroll calculation results and register payments and deductions for a worker.

To verify worker payments and deductions, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Queries** \> **Payments and deductions**.

2.  In the **Payments and deductions registration** form, in the left pane, a list of company employees is displayed.

3.  In the left pane, select an employee. The details about the accruals and deductions of the employees for the calculation period are updated in the right pane.

4.  To register a payment or deduction correction for an employee, select the employee in the left pane, and then in the right pane, click **New** to create a correction record. The current calculation period and identification code of the employee are updated in the **Corrected period** and **Employee** fields.

5.  Specify the pay type, amount, department, line values, account, and dimensions codes for the payment or deduction.

Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Reports** \> **Pivot tables** \> **Pay type transaction list**.

## 5\. If required: Recalculate salaries based on the latest modifications to the data

If you make changes to the employee data after completing payroll calculation for the employees, you can use the **Recent transactions** form to view the employees for whom you made changes, and recalculate the salaries for these employees. You can make changes such as specify additional accruals and deductions in the working time registration table or make changes to the average earnings, vacations, or sick time.

To recalculate salaries based on the latest modifications to the data, follow these steps:

## 6\. Calculate taxes and funds

You can generate the tax base values and calculate accrued individual income tax deductions and off-budget funds contributions. When you calculate taxes and funds, Microsoft Dynamics AX uses the results of the payroll calculation and processes the data for all of the employees within a legal entity.

To calculate taxes and funds, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Payroll calculation** \> **Data and funds calculation**.

2.  Microsoft Dynamics AX runs the calculation of taxes and funds for the current period.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The taxes and funds can only be calculated if the current calculation date is the last in the current calculation period.</P>



3.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Periodic** \> **Data for income tax calculation**.

## 7\. Create and post a salary journal

Use the **Salary journal** and **Journal voucher** forms to create and post a salary journal. After you create a salary journal for the current pay period, you cannot make changes in pay statements for that period. You can modify or delete the lines of a salary journal, although doing this is not recommended because it can cause deviations from the pay sheets, fund data, and tax registers. You can verify a journal before you post it. After you post the salary journal, you cannot make any changes to it. You can create a journal that contains reversed transactions for a posted journal.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can create a salary journal only if you complete the calculation of payroll, taxes, and funds for the current period.</P>



To create and post a salary journal, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Payroll calculation** \> **Salary journal**.

2.  In the **Salary journal** form, click **Create** \> **Create journal** to create a journal and journal lines. For more information, see [Journal header (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa557917\(v=ax.60\)).
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The <STRONG>Create journal</STRONG> button is available only if you complete the calculation of payroll, taxes, and funds for the current period.</P>



3.  Click **Lines** to open the **Journal voucher** form, where you can view and modify the lines for the salary journal. For more information, see [Journal voucher - General journal (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa591466\(v=ax.60\)). Close the form.

4.  In the **Salary journal** form, click **Post** \> **Preview journal transactions** to open the **Preview journal transactions** form, where you can view the details that are related to sales tax for each journal line, such as sales tax code, sales tax group, and item sales tax group. Close the form

5.  Click **Validate** \> **Validate** to validate the journal lines.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can also use the <STRONG>Distribution control</STRONG> form to view the relationship between pay types and accounting entities, such as accounts and dimensions that are based on the posting profile configuration. If there are any incorrect entries, you can correct them before posting the journal. Click <STRONG>Payroll (Russia)</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Queries</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Distribution control</STRONG>.</P>



6.  Click **Post** \> **Post** to post the journal.

You can click **Create** \> **Reverse journal** in the **Salary journal** form to reverse the accounting transactions of a posted journal. A journal that contains a reversal of the lines from the original journal is automatically created in the **Salary journal** form.

## 8\. Close a payroll period

After you calculate the payroll, taxes, and funds; create and post a salary journal; create salary pay sheets; and transfer salary payments; use the **Close the salary** form to close a payroll period. If you do not create pay sheets, a message is displayed that you must create pay sheets before closing the period. When you close a period, Microsoft Dynamics AX performs the following tasks:

  - Calculates debts of the employer and employees, and generates payroll lines for the amounts that have corresponding payroll types.

  - Changes the status of the calculation procedures to **Not calculated** in the **Calculation procedures state** form.

  - Changes the calculation period to the next reporting period. All of the new payroll lines automatically move to the new period.

  - Updates the current calculation date as the next date in the **Calculation calendar** area in the **Payroll parameters** form.

  - Remove payroll period records that are specific to an employee for the new payroll period records.

You cannot make any modifications to a closed period after you perform calculations for the new period. Transaction amounts in the ledger, the bank, and in cash are fixed. However, you can reopen and make changes in a closed period if you have not performed any calculations for the new period. You can make changes, such as reversing and recreating a salary journal after you recalculate the off-budget funds.

You can close the period for all employees or for a specific employee.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can close the payroll period only if the current calculation date is the last date in the current calculation period.</P>



To close a payroll period, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Payroll calculation** \> **Close the salary**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If you have already closed the period, a warning message displays, indicating that the modifications in the closed period cannot take place. If there are no errors in the payroll calculations, respond to this warning with a confirmation.</P>



2.  If required, click **Select** to specify additional criteria, such as employee codes , and then click **OK** to close the period for employees who meet the criteria. Alternatively, to close the period for all of the employees, do not specify any criteria.

3.  In the **Close the salary** form, click **OK** to close the period.
