## 1\. Add direct debit mandate information to a customer account

Before you can draw direct debit payments for customers who have a mandate, you must enter information about the mandate. Usually, only one mandate is in effect at a time for a customer. Therefore, a message is displayed if you try to enter a second mandate for the same customer.

To add direct debit mandate information to a customer account, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Customers** \> **All customers**.

2.  Double-click on a customer name.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, click **Edit**.

4.  On the **Direct debit mandates** FastTab, click **Add**.

5.  Enter information about the mandate. Make the following selections.
    
    <table>

    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />

    <li><p><strong>COR1</strong> – The COR1 direct debit mandate scheme, which can be used for businesses or consumers.</p>
    <p>This COR1 direct debit mandate scheme is available only if AX 2012 R3, AX 2012 R2 with the hotfix in KB2902097, or AX 2012 with the hotfix in KB2902097 is installed.</p></li>
    </ul></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Payment frequency</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Select how payments are made. Select from the following options.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Recurring</strong> – Mandates include multiple payments, such as installment plans or service agreements. Enter the number of payments in the <strong>Expected number of payments</strong> field.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>One-time</strong> – Mandates include only one payment.</p></li>
    </ul></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Mandate status</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>The mandate status is <strong>Incomplete</strong> until you enter all the required fields. The status then changes to <strong>New</strong>.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


6.  Optional: Change the default entries for the following fields, if you have to.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><p>Field</p></th>
    <th><p>Description</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>

    <td><p>Enter the date and location where the mandate was signed. The expiration date is automatically calculated, based on the signature date.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Expected number of payments</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>For recurring payments, enter the expected number of payments. For one-time payments, enter 1.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Usage count</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>For new mandates, this number is zero (0).</p>
    <p>The count is automatically updated every time that a payment for an invoice is posted.</p>
    <p>If a payment is settled with two invoices, the usage count is increased by two, even though only one payment is used.</p>
    <p>If a payment is settled with an invoice in another legal entity, the usage count is updated in the legal entity of the invoice.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


7.  In the **Default mandate ID** field, select the default mandate to use for transactions. These transactions include customer invoices for sales orders, free text invoices, interest notes, collection letters, project invoices, and journal entries. Select the mandate reference that will be used for these transactions most of the time. If you need to, you can use the **Customer transactions** form to change the mandate reference for a transaction after it has been posted.

## 2\. Optional: Generate a mandate for the customer to sign and return

If your business process requires it, you can print a partially completed mandate form for your customer to fill out, sign, and return to you.

To generate a mandate for the customer to sign and return, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Customers** \> **All customers**.

2.  Double-click on a customer name.

3.  On the **Direct debit mandates** FastTab, select a mandate, and then click **Print** \> **Mandate report**.

## 3\. Optional: Attach a scanned mandate to the customer account

If your customer has submitted a signed paper mandate form, you can scan it and attach it to the mandate for the customer’s account. For more information about how to scan and attach documents, see [Using document management](using-document-management.md).

To attach a scanned mandate to the mandate for the customer’s account, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Customers** \> **All customers**.

2.  Double-click on a customer name.

3.  On the **Direct debit mandates** FastTab, select a mandate, and then click **Attachments**.

## 4\. Optional: Cancel a mandate

If a mandate is no longer needed, you can cancel it if it isn’t assigned to an open invoice.

To cancel a mandate, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Customers** \> **All customers**.

2.  Double-click on a customer name.

3.  On the **Direct debit mandates** FastTab, select a mandate, and then click **More options** \> **Cancel mandate**.
