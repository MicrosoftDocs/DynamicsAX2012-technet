# (BRA) About import fiscal documents 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can issue an import fiscal document when you create a purchase order to import items from a foreign vendor. An import fiscal document records transit information about the items that you import. The import fiscal document is used to release items from customs, and to validate the entry of the items in the warehouse of the legal entity. You must specify the import declaration information (the addition number and import declaration number) for a purchase order that is issued to import items from a foreign vendor before you post the purchase order.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In AX 2012 R3 and cumulative update 6 or later for AX 2012 R2: You can also issue an import fiscal document when you create a purchase order to import services from a foreign vendor. When you import a service, it is not mandatory to specify the import declaration number and addition number for the vendor invoice. For more information, see <A href="bra-create-and-post-a-purchase-order-for-a-foreign-vendor.md">(BRA) Create and post a purchase order for a foreign vendor</A>.</P>



Before you can generate an import fiscal document, you must select the **Generate incoming fiscal document** check box for the foreign vendor in the **Vendors** form.

You can also cancel an incorrect import fiscal document. For more information, see [(BRA) Cancel a vendor fiscal document](bra-cancel-a-vendor-fiscal-document.md).
