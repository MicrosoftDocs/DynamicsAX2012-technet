# Work with installment billing 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

You can set up a payment schedule that lets customers pay in installments over time. If you associate a payment schedule with a call center catalog, call center customers can use installment billing as the method of payment for their orders. This topic describes how to set up and use installment billing in a call center.

The following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you start.

## 1\. Set up a payment schedule

First, set up a payment schedule in **Accounts receivable**. The payment schedule specifies the number of payment installments and the amount that the customer pays per installment. For more information, see [Payment schedules (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa572068\(v=ax.60\)).

## 2\. Add the payment schedule to a call center catalog

Next, add the payment schedule to the catalog that the call center is using. The payment schedule then becomes available as one of the payment options in the **Sales order** form.

To add a payment schedule to a catalog, follow these steps.

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Common** \> **Catalogs** \> **Catalogs**.

2.  Select a catalog, and then, on the **Action Pane**, in the **Maintain** group, click **Edit**.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, in the **Call center** group, click **Payment schedules**.

4.  Click **New**, and then select a payment schedule.

## 3\. Set parameters for installment billing

Next, set the options for installment billing in the **Call center parameters** form.

To set parameters for installment billing, follow these steps.

1.  Click **Call center** \> **Setup** \> **Call center parameters**.

2.  In the left pane, click **Payment**, and then set the options on the **Installment plan** FastTab.

    <td><p>The number of days before the due date of an installment payment to generate a letter to the customer.</p></td>
    </tr>

    <td><p><strong>Adjustment method</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>The method to use to adjust payments if the total payment amount changes.</p></td>
    </tr>

    <p>After the limit is reached, the payment is added to the queue for review in the <strong>Installment payments authorization</strong> form.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Accelerate payments</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>A selected check box indicates that, if the limit that is set in the <strong>Reauthorization limit</strong> field is reached, the remaining payment balance is due.</p></td>

## 5\. Use installment billing in a sales order

After you've added a payment schedule to a call center catalog, and enabled installment billing for customers and products, you can use installment billing as a payment option for call center orders.

To use installment billing in a sales order, follow these steps.

    You can now invoice the order and post the invoice.

## 6\. Process installment billing payments

On the date that each installment payment is due, you must process installment payments. For credit card payments, the processing submits the payments for authorization and settles the transaction. For on-account payments, the payment is added to the balance of the customer's account.

4.  Click **OK**.

If an installment payment by credit card cannot be authorized by the payment processor, you can handle the authorization manually.

To authorize a credit card payment, follow these steps.

1.  Click **Call center** \> **Journals** \> **Payment management** \> **Credit cards** \> **Installment payments authorization**.

2.  If the payment appears on the **Pending authorization** tab, select the payment, and then follow one of these steps:
    
      - To authorize the payment, click **Manually authorize**. You must enter an authorization code that you have obtained from the payment service.
    
      - To resubmit the payment for authorization, click **Process**.
    
      - To decline the payment, click **Manually decline**, and then enter a decline reason code.
    
    –or–
    
    If the payment appears on the **Declined** tab, select the payment, and then follow one of these steps:
    
      - To decline the payment, click **Manually decline**, and then enter a decline reason code.
    
      - To resubmit the payment for authorization, click **Process**.

3.  Optional: If the payment information that was originally entered in the sales order is incorrect, use the **Sales order** button to modify the information.

## 7\. Close installment orders

After all the installment payments for a sales order have been processed, you can close the order.

To close all the sales orders for which installment payments have been completed, follow these steps.
