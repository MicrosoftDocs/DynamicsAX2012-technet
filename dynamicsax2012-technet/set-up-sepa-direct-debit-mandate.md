# Set up SEPA direct debit mandate 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This topic explains how to configure Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA) direct debit mandates. A SEPA direct debit lets a creditor collect funds from a customer's bank account, provided that a signed mandate has been granted by the customer to the creditor. The customer signs a mandate that authorizes the creditor to collect a payment and instructs the customer's bank to pay the collection.

## 1\. Set up a number sequence for direct debit mandates

Each direct debit mandate must have a unique number. Use the **Number sequences** form to create a number sequence for direct debit mandates.

To set up a number sequence for direct debit mandates, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Common** \> **Number sequences** \> **Number sequences**.

2.  On the **Action Pane**, click **Number sequence**.

3.  In the **Number sequence code** field, enter an identifier. You will use this identifier to assign the number sequence to the direct debit mandate system in the **Accounts receivable parameters** form.

4.  On the **Segments** FastTab, create segments. For example, you might use the following format: **SDD-\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#**

5.  On the **General** FastTab, select the **Manual** check box or the **Continuous** check box to enter a manual number sequence or to generate a continuous number sequence.

6.  In the **Smallest** field, enter the lowest possible value that can be used to automatically generate numbers for the number sequence. This field is available only if you select the **Continuous** check box.

## 2\. Set up Accounts receivable parameters for direct debit mandates

Use the **Accounts receivable parameters** form to set up parameters for direct debit mandates.

To set up parameters for direct debit mandates, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Accounts receivable parameters**.

2.  Click **Direct debit**, and then in the **Direct debit** area, make the following selections.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><p>Field</p></th>
    <th><p>Description</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Days required for the first pre-notification</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Days required for recurring pre-notifications</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the number of days to allow for pre-notifications when a new mandate is added.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Days required for the first core scheme bank submission</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Days required for recurring core scheme bank submissions</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the number of days to allow for bank submissions that use the core scheme.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Days required for the first B2B bank submission</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Days required for recurring B2B bank submissions</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the number of days to allow for bank submissions that use the business-to-business (B2B) scheme.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Days required for the first COR1 bank submission</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Days required for recurring COR1 bank submissions</strong></p>
    <p>These controls are available only when Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, AX 2012 R2 with the hotfix in KB2902097, and AX 2012 with the hotfix in KB2902097 is installed.</p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the number of days to allow for bank submissions that use the COR1 mandate scheme.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Months between usage and expiration</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>The default entry is 36 months (three years).</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


3.  Click **Number sequences**, and then in the **Number sequences** area, select a number sequence code for the **Direct debit mandate ID** reference.

## 3\. Set up a method of payment for direct debit mandates

You must set up a method of payment for direct debit mandates. You use this method of payment to query on invoices to generate direct debit payments for. Use the **Methods of payment** form to set up the method of payment.

To set up a method of payment for direct debit mandates, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Payment** \> **Methods of payment**.

2.  Enter a name for the method of payment, such as **SEPA direct debit**.

3.  Optional: If you expect each of your customers to have multiple mandates, in the **Period** field, select **Invoice**. This creates a separate payment for each invoice, and each payment uses the mandate that is specified for the invoice.

4.  In the **Payment type** field, select **Electronic payment**.

5.  Select the **Require mandate** check box to create payments using direct debit mandates.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The <STRONG>Require mandate</STRONG> check box is available only if you select <STRONG>Electronic payment</STRONG> in the <STRONG>Payment type</STRONG> field.</P>



## Next step

You have finished setting up SEPA direct debit mandates. Next, add direct debit mandate information to a customer record. For more information, see [Add direct debit mandate information to a customer account](add-direct-debit-mandate-information-to-a-customer-account.md).
