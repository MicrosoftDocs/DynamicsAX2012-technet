You can rearrange or move items that have been picked and delivered to the staging area. Use the following procedure:

2.  Under **Shipment overview**, select the line that contains items that you want to rearrange.

3.  Click **Functions**, and select how you want to move the items.

4.  If you make additional changes to the individual lines for the line that you have moved, you must select that line, and then enter a quantity in the **Move quantity** field. And then for the Detailed lines, click **Functions** and select how you want the quantities moved.

5.  In the **Move** form, specify the quantity and the location and pallet that you want it to be moved to.

6.  Click **OK**.

7.  The program removes the lines that you have unpicked.
