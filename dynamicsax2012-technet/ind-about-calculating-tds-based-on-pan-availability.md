# (IND) About calculating TDS based on PAN availability 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

When you apply tax deducted at source (TDS) to vendor payments, you must specify the vendor’s Permanent Account Number (PAN). If the PAN is not available, TDS is calculated at the highest rate.

You can verify a vendor’s Permanent Account Number (PAN) availability in the **Vendors** form, on the **Tax information** FastTab. If the **Status** field is set to **Applied**, **Invalid**, or **Not available**, the TDS is calculated at the highest rate.

When you generate vendor statements or reports, the PAN status of the vendor, as it is recorded in the system at the time of reporting, is included in the statement or report. The PAN status for the vendor is a part of what determines the rate of the TDS.
