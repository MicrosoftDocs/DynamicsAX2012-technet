# Select default profiles for Role Centers 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Microsoft Dynamics AX includes several default user profiles that are available for various roles in the organization, such as the chief financial officer or accounting manager. These profiles contain role-specific information and determine the content that is displayed on Role Center pages.

## Select default user profiles for a company

Before you can assign users to profiles, you must select the profiles that are used in each company. You can select additional profiles at any time.

1.  Open the Microsoft Dynamics AX client.

2.  Switch to the company where you want to select profiles.

3.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Role center** \> **Initialize role center profiles**.

4.  Select the profiles that you want to use. Each profile requires a license. If you select a profile and your business or organization did not purchase the license, the role center page returns an error when a user attempts to view it.

5.  Click **OK**.
