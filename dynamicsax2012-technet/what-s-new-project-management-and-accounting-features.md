<td><p>Support for progress billing, estimates, and revenue recognition when you migrate data from other Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems</p></td>
<td><p>When you migrate data from one ERP system to another, one challenge is to bring existing data into the estimation system, so that revenue can continue to be recognized for Fixed-price projects that have already started. Because revenue recognition is based on a completed percentage, the data must be migrated so that both the percentage of work that is already completed (actual cost) and the amount of work that remains on the project (estimated cost to complete) are reflected in the correct accounts.</p>
<p>Because some Fixed-price projects can span multiple years, the actual cost to date can also be derived from several years of transactions. Therefore, the key challenge in an ERP migration is to post a lump sum transaction in the beginning balance journal and connect it correctly to the estimate system.</p>
<p>To address these data migration issues, the new beginning balance and progress billing features integrate with the existing estimation system to support revenue recognition for Fixed-price projects.</p>

<td><p>A series of minor feature changes have been implemented for Project management and accounting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>Worker ID</strong>, formerly <strong>Employee ID</strong>, field is no longer required for hourly transactions in Project management and accounting. Therefore, route operations can be assigned to work center groups, not just to individual work centers.</p></li>
<li><p>Several references to period tables in Project management and accounting have been replaced with fiscal calendar objects, relations, and methods.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="about-fiscal-calendars-fiscal-years-and-periods.md">About fiscal calendars, fiscal years, and periods</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You can copy a project ID to a purchase order when the purchase order is made from an item requirement has been restored. This functionality is required, so that users can view a full list of the purchase orders that are related to a project.</p></li>

<td><p>Designate a project cost price as an effective labor rate</p></td>
<td><p>AX 2012 R2 introduces support for specifying a worker's hourly cost price on projects as an effective labor rate. The effective labor rate defines the hourly cost if the worker works all the hours in a work week. The cost price of the effective labor rate for a period is calculated by using the following formula:</p>
<p>Effective labor rate price per hour * (Number of hours in the work week according to the worker's calendar / Number of hours registered in the week)</p>
<p>The <strong>Project setup</strong> form now includes a <strong>Use effective labor rate</strong> check box. If this check box is selected, you can mark a worker's hourly price in the <strong>Cost price - hour</strong> form as an effective labor rate.</p>

<td><p>Improved support for project estimates and revenue recognition</p></td>
<td><p>In earlier versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX, a project manager who wanted an estimate project to be created to support a Fixed-price project or an Investment project had to remember to select the <strong>New estimate project</strong> check box in the <strong>Create project</strong> form. Otherwise, use of the estimate system to recognize revenue was not fully supported.</p>
<p>In AX 2012 R2, an estimate project is created automatically when the project manager creates a Fixed-price project or Investment project. As part of this change, cost templates and period codes no longer have to be assigned to each project individually, but can be assigned to project groups instead. This change supports the more common practice of using the same cost template and estimate period for most or all Fixed-price projects and Investment projects. This change also reflects the fact that other accrual and revenue recognition options are set up in project groups.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="create-an-estimate-project.md">Create an estimate project</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Intercompany resource scheduling and UX improvements</p></td>
<td><p>Major enhancements have been made to the resource scheduling feature in the Project Management and Accounting Add-in (Project III).</p>
<p>A new intercompany resource scheduling feature makes it easy for a worker in one legal entity to be assigned to a project in a related legal entity.</p>
<p>Support for staffing a project and viewing the status of project staffing is improved. Therefore, project managers can now more easily perform several tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Discover the scheduling status of a project.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the best resources for projects and activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Assign resources to projects and activities. Resources can also be automatically assigned to projects.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Project managers can also easily view a list of resources that are assigned to a project, release resources from all assignments in a project, and view the assignment details for resources that are assigned to a project.</p>
<p>Soft-booking support has been updated, so that a worker’s soft-booked hours do not count against the worker’s overall availability.</p>
<p>When a project is closed, all of a worker’s bookings that are made for the project are released automatically.</p>
<p>Resources that are assigned to a project no longer have to be manually added to a validation group for the project. This validation, which lets a worker enter timesheet lines for the project, is set up automatically when a worker is assigned to a project.</p>
<p>For more information, see the white paper <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36845">Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 White Paper: Resource Scheduling for Projects</a>.</p></td>

<td><p>Expanded support for project budget checks when document lines are saved</p></td>
<td><p>In the <strong>Project management and accounting parameters</strong> form, the <strong>Check budget on document line save</strong> option previously applied only to financial budget documents, such as purchase requisitions and purchase orders, not to journals that are related to project budget. In AX 2012 R2, budget checks are now performed when changes are made to hour journals, expense journals, fee journals, and item journals. Budget checks are triggered when changes are made to any of the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Project ID</p></li>
<li><p>Activity number</p></li>

<td><p>Consumption of project items on product receipt, even if there is no item requirement</p></td>
<td><p>In AX 2012, if an item was added to the purchase order for a project but was not preceded by an item requirement, the item could not be consumed and invoiced to the project contract's funding source until the related vendor invoice was posted. In AX 2012 R2, project items can be immediately consumed and invoiced to the project’s contract funding source, before the vendor invoice for the purchase order is posted, even if an item requirement does not precede the purchase order.</p>
