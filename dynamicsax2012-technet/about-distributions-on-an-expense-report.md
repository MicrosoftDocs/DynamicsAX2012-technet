# About distributions on an expense report 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When you enter expenses on an expense report, you can distribute the expense across multiple projects, legal entities, or accounts in your organization.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Expense transactions can be entered only in Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX. However, you can view the transactions in the <STRONG>Expense report</STRONG> form in the <STRONG>Travel and expense</STRONG> module.</P>



For example, Nancy, a Fabrikam sales representative, traveled from Copenhagen to Frankfurt. In Frankfurt, she met with two organizations to discuss separate projects for each organization. Nancy spent seven business days working with organization A on project A, and three business days working with organization B on project B.

Because Nancy worked on two separate projects when she was in Frankfurt, when she enters her expense report, she distributes her expenses as appropriate for each project. The following table shows how Nancy distributed her expenses.
