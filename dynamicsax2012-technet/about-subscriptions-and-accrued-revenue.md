# About subscriptions and accrued revenue 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A subscription is an agreement between your organization and a customer. This agreement requires the customer to prepay for periodic or regular services. A subscription can be used for **Fee - subscription** transactions that are created for a Time and material project. These transactions are then applied to the **Accrued revenue - subscription** account. The transactions can also be viewed in a profit and loss statement.

To post the accrued revenue on a subscription, the **Accrue revenue** check box in the **Subscription groups** form must be selected for the subscription group that the subscription is assigned to.

When you invoice transactions for which revenue has been accrued, the **Accrued revenue - subscription** account is debited by the same amount that the **Invoiced revenue** account is credited. As a result, revenue in the profit and loss account becomes 0 (zero).

When accrued revenue is posted, the **WIP - subscription** account is debited by the accrual amount, and the **Accrued revenue - subscription** account is credited by the accrual amount.

If you reverse an accrued transaction, the **Accrued revenue - subscription** account is debited by the same amount that the **WIP - subscription** account is credited.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You cannot post accrued revenue until the invoice for the subscription is posted.</P>
