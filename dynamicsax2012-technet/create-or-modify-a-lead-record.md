Your organization can use lead records to help your sales team gather and store information about a lead, and then implement the sales activities and tasks that will qualify a lead to move to the next level and become an opportunity or a customer.

Lead records contain various types of information. For example, you can store and attach information for multiple contacts and addresses, source types and references, and documents. You can also associate multiple responsibilities, activities, campaigns, projects, and other leads to a lead record.

As you manage a lead record, you can update the status to reflect where it is in the sales process. You can qualify a lead record and then create a new opportunity or a customer record for the lead.

You can disqualify, delete, or postpone a record if it appears that the lead will not become an opportunity or customer with your company. When you delete a lead record, you can also delete any associated activities, responsibilities, and campaigns. If you postpone a lead record, you can reactivate or disqualify the lead later.
