    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If you attached a service tax code (STC) number to the address of the legal entity in the <STRONG>Manage tax information</STRONG> form, the <STRONG>STC number</STRONG> field is updated with the STC number of the legal entity. The STC number is used to identify the ledger accounts that service tax amounts are posted to. For more information, see <A href="ind-key-tasks-tax-information-for-legal-entities.md">(IND) Key tasks: Tax information for legal entities</A>.</P>



6.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Purchase** tab, click **Confirm** to confirm the purchase order.
