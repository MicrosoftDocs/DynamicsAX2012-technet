    For more information about the hardware and software requirements for Microsoft Dynamics AX, see the [system requirements](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=165377).

  - Make sure that the Windows Update service is running on the computer where you will install this component.

## Install management utilities

1.  Start Microsoft Dynamics AX Setup. Under **Install**, select **Microsoft Dynamics AX components**.

2.  Advance through the first wizard pages.

3.  If the Setup Support files have not yet been installed on this computer, the **Select a file location** page is displayed. The Setup Support files are required for installation. Provide a file location or accept the default location, and then click **Next**. On the **Ready to install** page, click **Install**.

9.  On the **Specify client configuration options** page, specify whether you want management utilities to access configuration information from the registry on the local computer or from a shared configuration file. If you want to use a shared configuration file, enter the network location of the file. Click **Next**.
