<td><p>Demand forecasting is a set of tools that enable you to estimate future demand and create demand forecasts based on historical transaction data. The demand forecasting process includes the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Complete the prerequisite setup tasks before you can use demand forecasting.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a baseline forecast from historical demand data that is gathered and loaded in a Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services cube.</p></li>

<li><p>Optional: Calculate the accuracy of past demand forecasts against past actual demand to improve forecast accuracy.</p></li>
<li><p>Optional: Remove outliers from the historical data to improve demand forecast accuracy.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can specify whether a customer forecast is included in the overall forecast. This setting determines how actual demand reduces the forecasted demand. You can use this setting to ensure that master planning covers the supply of items that are purchased by specific customers.</p>
<p>You can select the start time to schedule production orders. The start time can be the start of the calendar work day or the current time. The current time option is used with the delivery date control and capable to promise (CTP) feature.</p>

<li><p>You can hold a requisition from further processing and indicate the reason for the hold, so that you can better manage requisitions and communicate status.</p></li>

<td><p>In Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services, Cloud hosted environments is a new tool that you can use to deploy Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 environments on Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>When you use the Cloud hosted environments tool, youâ€™ll need to select the type of Microsoft Dynamics AX environment that you want to deploy, such as a demo, developer/test, or production environment. Based on your selection, the Cloud hosted environments tool provisions the appropriate number of virtual machines in Azure. These virtual machines have Microsoft Dynamics AX components (and all of their prerequisites) already installed on them.</p>
