# Temporary group assignment [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Workers in **Time and attendance** are divided into calculation groups and approval groups. A supervisor or manager is responsible for calculating the registrations from workers who are associated with a calculation group.

## Seconding and approvals

In order to handle a situation where a worker is seconded to another team, it is possible for a supervisor to second a worker to another calculation group or approval group for a specific period of time.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>It may not be the same person who approves registrations that have been calculated. For example, a manager, or a payroll administrator may have the task of approving registrations from workers belonging to a particular approval group.</P>
