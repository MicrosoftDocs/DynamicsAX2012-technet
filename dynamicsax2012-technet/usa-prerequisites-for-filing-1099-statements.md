# (USA) Prerequisites for filing 1099 statements 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_


> [!NOTE]
> <P>We recommend that you review IRS rule changes for the applicable tax year before you set up and process 1099 statements.</P>



You must obtain a Transmitter Control Code (TCC) before you can file 1099 statements electronically. You can request this code from the IRS by using IRS Form 4419. You must include the TCC on all 1099 statements and enter it in the **Legal entities** form.

If you are filing 1099 statements electronically or magnetically, enter the TCC in the **1099 transmitter** form. The first year that you submit electronic or magnetic files, you must first submit a test file to the IRS. If you file a paper copy of a 1099 statement, enter the company telephone number in the **Contact number/address** field on the **Contact information** FastTab in the **Legal entities** form.

For more information about electronic or magnetic filing, see IRS publication 1220.
