# What's new: Sales tax processing 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Sales tax processing in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 has been updated to help organizations comply with applicable tax laws in many countries/regions. These tax laws include the European Union’s 2010 regulations about value-added tax (VAT) for services. Reporting for the European Union (EU) sales list has been updated to comply with these changes. Tax rates can now have up to five decimal places. Changes to calculated taxes for selected source documents are now saved before the source document is journalized. Changes to calculated taxes for selected journals are now saved before the journal entries are posted.

For more information about taxes in AX 2012, see the white papers [Implementing the Tax Framework for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012](http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/c/d/7cdddc76-0e08-4240-8c51-ece6142255c9/implementing+the+tax+framework_ax2012.pdf) and [Implementing the Account and Financial Dimensions Framework for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Applications](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=213133%26clcid=0x409).

## New functionality

Tax rates that contain up to five decimal places can be used.

On January 1, 2010, changes to the rules that govern the place of supply of services took effect. These changes also affect the simplified compliance requirements for EU businesses that provide VAT-taxable services in multiple EU member states.

Changes to EU sales list reporting provide more detailed reporting by item, service, or investment amounts.

## Special considerations

You must understand how the sales tax functionality in Microsoft Dynamics AX works. For more information, see [Setting up sales tax codes](setting-up-sales-tax-codes.md) and [Setting up sales tax](setting-up-sales-tax.md).

## Comparison with Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009

Taxes have changed considerably since AX 2009. AX 2012 includes changes to the following areas:

  - Decimal places in tax rates for sales tax codes

  - Saving calculated taxes before source documents or journals are posted

  - VAT package for services

  - Reporting for EU sales list transfer functions

Otherwise, the sales tax information that is calculated might override the actual amounts in some cases.</p>
