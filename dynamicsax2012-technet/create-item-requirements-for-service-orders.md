# Create item requirements for service orders 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, you can create a service order to track and manage services that you provide to your customers. If you need to reserve specific items for a service order, you can create inventory item requirements for it. An item requirement can be immediately consumed from inventory, or it can initiate a production order for the item.

By using an item requirement instead of an item transaction, you can plan for delivery just before the item is actually used, create a purchase order, include the item in the trade-agreement framework, and include the item requirement in production planning.

Item requirements for service orders are processed through a project. To create an item requirement on a service order, the service order must be assigned to a project. After you create an item requirement for a service order, you can view the item requirement in the **Projects** form for the selected project.
