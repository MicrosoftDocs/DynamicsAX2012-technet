# (LVA) Assign tax categories to fixed assets 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

In accordance with Latvian tax requirements, the income tax for a company is adjusted using asset depreciation, and the income tax is calculated using the tax depreciation method. The tax depreciation method is an extension of the reducing balance method, which is used in Latvia to determine the income tax for business organizations.

Before you assign a value model to a fixed asset, you must set up a depreciation profile and a value model for tax depreciation.
