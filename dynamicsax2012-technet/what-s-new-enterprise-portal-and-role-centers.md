# What's new: Enterprise Portal and Role Centers 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Microsoft Dynamics AX provides a set of websites that give you access to data and that you can use to participate in business processes by using web-based forms. These sites are collectively called Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX.

Enterprise Portal can be configured to display role-specific home pages that are known as Role Centers. A Role Center provides an overview of information that pertains to a user’s job function in the business or organization. This information includes transaction data, alerts, links, and common tasks that are associated with the user’s role in the company. The information also include reports that are generated by Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) or Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS). Microsoft Dynamics AX includes more than two dozen predefined Role Centers, which users can access from Enterprise Portal or the Microsoft Dynamics AX client.

## Special considerations

**Required software**: Enterprise Portal and Role Centers require one of the following Microsoft SharePoint products:

  - Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010

  - Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010

  - Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2013

  - Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013

For more information, see [Hardware and software requirements](hardware-and-software-requirements.md).

**Search**: Enterprise Portal search is provided by a product-wide feature of Microsoft Dynamics AX that is named Enterprise Search. Enterprise Search lets users search through data, metadata, and documents that are attached to records. Users can search for common nouns, such as “customer” and “cash flow report.” Users can also search for specific data, such as a customer name, product ID, or telephone number. For more information, see [Enterprise Search](enterprise-search.md).

**User controls**: If you created user controls for Enterprise Portal pages in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, you must update those controls for Enterprise Portal pages in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. For more information, see [User Control Changes](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh272129\(v=ax.60\)). For information about how to upgrade existing Enterprise Portal integrations, see [Converting Enterprise Portal Content](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc551034\(v=ax.60\)).
