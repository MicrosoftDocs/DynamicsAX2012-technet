Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services is a server-based solution that provides online analytical processing (OLAP) functionality. Analytical reports help users examine business data and identify trends that they might not otherwise discover when viewing data on traditional reports.

To integrate Microsoft Dynamics AX and Analysis Services, you must complete several procedures. You must first run the Microsoft Dynamics AX Setup wizard and select the **Analysis Services configuration** option. This option configures Analysis Services so that it can be used with Microsoft Dynamics AX. The topics in this section provide step-by-step instructions.
