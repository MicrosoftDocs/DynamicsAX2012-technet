# Identify unpublished functional areas in RapidStart Services [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

Beginning October 1, 2015, RapidStart services will no longer be supported. For more information, see the announcement on CustomerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/northamerica/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued or PartnerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/news-events/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued.

In Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services, before a functional area can be used in a template as a basis for configuring and implementing an instance of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, the functional area must be published. Designers in RapidStart Services can use the **Design** area to identify which functional areas are not currently published.

## Identify unpublished functional areas on the Functional area page

1.  In the RapidStart Services header, click **Design**, and then click **Functional area**.

2.  Above the list of functional areas, click **Unpublished**.

## Identify unpublished functional areas in the Functional areas form

1.  In the RapidStart Services header, click **Design**.

2.  On the **Templates** page, click the **Templates** button, and then select **Add or remove functional area**.
    
    In the **Functional areas** form, unpublished functional areas are indicated by a yellow caution symbol.
