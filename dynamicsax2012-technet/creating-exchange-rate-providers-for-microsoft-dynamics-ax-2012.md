# Creating Exchange Rate Providers for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This document provides code examples to help developers create exchange rate providers in .NET or X++, based on the preference and skills of each developer. Also, because there are no limits to the method that the exchange rate providers use to get exchange rates, some scenarios that are possible with the framework are provided.
