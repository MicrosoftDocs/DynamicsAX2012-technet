# Consume item requirements in a project 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX, an item requirement is managed as a sales order line on a single sales order that is associated with a project. This item can be immediately consumed from inventory, or it can initiate a production order or purchase order for the item. Item consumption is recorded as a posting that registers that the item was used in the project.

If necessary, an item requirement can be partially consumed.

1.  Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Common** \> **Projects** \> **All projects**.

2.  Select or open a project for which you have created an item requirement.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Manage** tab, in the **New** group, click **Item task**, and then click **Item requirement**.

5.  On the menu bar, click **Posting**, and then click **Packing slip**.

6.  In the **Packing slip posting** form, on the **Parameters** tab, in the **Quantity** field, select the **All** option.

7.  Use the fields in the **Print options** group to specify how you want the packing slip to be printed.

8.  On the **Setup** tab, enter the date for the packing slip.

9.  Click **OK** to post the record, print the packing slip, and transmit the required information to the shipping carrier's software.
