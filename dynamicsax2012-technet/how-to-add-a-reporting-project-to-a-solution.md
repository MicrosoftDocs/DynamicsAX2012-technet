# How to: Add a Reporting Project to a Solution [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A solution contains one or more projects. You will find report projects that have been added to the AOT under the **Visual Studio Projects** node and then expand the **Dynamics AX Model Projects** node. To add report projects to the AOT, in the Solution Explorer, right-click the reporting project and then click **Add \[project name\] to AOT**. For information about the other projects supported in Microsoft Dynamics AX, see [Visual Studio Integration](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg889299\(v=ax.60\)) and [How to: Add a Visual Studio Project to Microsoft Dynamics AX Version Control](how-to-add-a-visual-studio-project-to-microsoft-dynamics-ax-version-control.md).

There are two ways to add a reporting project to a solution. You can add a new reporting project to a solution or you can add an existing reporting project from another solution. The following procedures explain how to add a reporting project to a solution in Microsoft Visual Studio.

### To add a new reporting project

1.  From the Visual Studio **File** menu, point to **Add**, and then click **New Project**. The **Add New Project** dialog box is displayed.

2.  In the **Installed Templates** pane, select the **Microsoft Dynamics AX** node.

3.  In the **Templates** pane, select **Report Model**.

4.  In the **Name** field, type a name for the project.

5.  In the **Location** field, enter a path, or click **Browse**.

6.  Click **OK**.

### To add an existing reporting project from another solution

1.  On the Visual Studio **File** menu, point to **Add**, and then click **Existing Project**. The **Add Existing Project** dialog box is displayed.

2.  Select the reporting project, and then click **Open**.
