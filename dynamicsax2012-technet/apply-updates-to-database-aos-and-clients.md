## Prepare the environment for updates

We strongly recommend that you complete the following procedures before you install updates in your environment.

## Back up databases

Before you install any updates, we strongly recommend that you back up any databases in the environment that are affected by the updates. For more information, see [Back up and recover databases (SQL Server)](back-up-and-recover-databases-sql-server.md).

## Export external invoices (required if you are running tax integration for China)

If your environment includes tax integration for China, you must export external invoices before you install updates.

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Periodic** \> **Tax integration** \> **Export to file**.

2.  On the **Batch** tab, enter a description for the batch, and then click **OK**. By default, all invoices are selected.

## Apply an update package to AX 2012 R3

Updates for AX 2012 R3 are available from Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services. You can download a specific cumulative update package. Alternatively, you can download the **Most recent** update package, which contains the most recent updates in addition to the latest cumulative update. You can then install the whole package or select a subset of the package to apply.

## Get ready to install an update package (R3)

We strongly recommend that you complete this procedure before you apply updates.

1.  For each environment that you manage, create a project in Lifecycle Services. For more information, see [Projects (Lifecycle Services, LCS)](projects-lifecycle-services-lcs.md).

2.  Install and run the System diagnostics for each environment, so that the information about your project in Lifecycle Services is accurate.

3.  Download the most recent version of the Update installer.
    
    1.  Log on to Lifecycle Services, open the project that is associated with the environment that you are updating, and then click **Updates**.
    
    2.  Under **Update installer for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3**, click **Download**.
        
        Save the Update installer to a network location that you can access from the computers in your environment.
    
    3.  Extract the Update installer to every computer in the environment that you might have to apply updates to.
        

        > [!NOTE]
        > <P>To extract the Update installer, you must be an administrator on the local computer.</P>
        > <P>For information about the recommended installation order when you apply updates, see <A href="apply-updates-and-hotfixes.md">Apply updates and hotfixes</A>.</P>



4.  Verify that you have appropriate permissions. To run the Update installer, you must have administrator rights on the local computer and System Administrator rights in Microsoft Dynamics AX.
    
    To install application hotfixes, you must have the following additional rights in Microsoft SQL Server:
    
      - You are a member of the **Securityadmin** server role on the SQL Server instance.
    
      - You are assigned to the **db\_owner** role in the model database.

## Find, analyze, save, and install an update package (R3)

We recommend that you first complete this procedure on an instance of Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Object Server (AOS) that is connected to the appropriate database instance, and select both binary and application hotfixes. In this way, you create as few custom update packages as possible.

1.  On any AOS, client, or database computer in the environment, run the Update installer (AXUpdate), and accept the license terms.

2.  On the **Download or install updates** page, click **Download updates**.

3.  Lifecycle Services opens in a browser window. Log on, and select the appropriate update package.

4.  Optional: If you have access to a project in Lifecycle Services that contains business processes that you want to use to help select appropriate updates, click **Get business process information for a Lifecycle Services project**. Select the appropriate project, and then click **OK**.

5.  After the package downloads, the **Select update type** page opens. Select binary updates, application updates, or both. For more information about hotfix types, see [Apply updates and hotfixes](apply-updates-and-hotfixes.md)
    
    If binary updates are available for the computer that you are installing on, we strongly recommend that you select them in addition to the application updates.

6.  If you selected to install application updates, follow these steps:
    
    1.  On the **Choose a model store** page, select a local instance to update, or click **Find a different model store** to enter the name of a remote database instance.
    
    2.  On the **Select application updates** page, you can select **All updates**, or **Applicable updates**. You can optionally use the **Fix type**, **Module**, **License code**, **Region/Country**, or **Business process** field list to filter the application updates.
        
        You can group application updates by fix type, number of conflicts, business process, or configuration key.
        
        For any hotfix, the **Details** pane displays the KB number and title of the hotfix, the model and layers that the hotfix applies to, and any updates that are included. Review the hotfix details, and then click the **Conflicts** tab to view the conflict summary. Use **Get conflict details** to view additional detailed information or open the Impact Analysis Wizard for a single hotfix.
    
    3.  The **Review conflicts** page lists the number of conflicts that are associated with each model file that will be installed. To review conflicts in detail, click **Impact Analysis Wizard**. For information about how to run the Impact Analysis Wizard, see Analyze updates (R3 and CU7).
    
    4.  On the **Review updates** page, click **Next**.

7.  Optional: On the **Save updates** page, click **Save custom update package**. You can then reuse the installation package that you have created on another computer in your environment.
    
    After the custom update package has been created, you can open the location where it is stored.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If you have selected binary updates, all binary updates are saved to the custom update package that you create, regardless of the computer or components that you have chosen to update.</P>



8.  To immediately install the selected updates on the current computer, click **Install selected updates on this computer**, and then click **Next**.

9.  On the **Review components** page, validate that the correct components are selected, and then click **Next**.

10. On the **Ready to install** page, review the summary, and then click **Install**.
    
    When installation is completed, you can see whether each component was installed.

11. Continue with the Perform post-installation steps section of this topic.

12. Use the instructions in the Install a saved update package (R3) section to install the same set of updates on all appropriate computers in your environment.

  - If you are enrolled in a support plan directly with Microsoft, log on to [CustomerSource](https://mbs.microsoft.com/support/newstart.aspx), and submit a new support request.

Updates for Microsoft Dynamics AX are shipped as self-extracting executable files. Before you can install an update, you must extract the files that are required to install it.

1.  Download the update.

2.  Double-click the downloaded file to extract the contents.
    
    We recommend that you extract the files to a location that can be accessed from all servers and clients that you plan to update.

## Analyze the effect of a single update or hotfix on your environment (CU6 and earlier)

Microsoft Dynamics AX updates are shipped together with the Impact Analysis tool, AXImpactAnalysis.exe. This tool is a version of the update installer that helps you determine the effect that an update has on your environment before you install the update.

1.  Browse to the location where you extracted the files for the service pack, right-click **AXImpactAnalysis.exe**, and then click **Run as Administrator**.

2.  On the **Welcome to Microsoft Dynamics AX Update Setup—Impact Analysis Mode** page, click **Next**.

3.  On the **License terms** page, review the license terms. Select the option to accept the license terms, and then click **Next**.

4.  On the **Select client configuration** page, select a client configuration or a configuration file to analyze, and then click **Next**.

5.  On the **Select model store** page, select a model store to analyze, and then click **Next**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The model store that you select must be the same model store that is used by the client configuration that you selected.</P>



6.  On the **Select baseline model store** page, select a baseline model store to use for the impact analysis, and then click **Next**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The model store that you select must be the same model store that is used by the client configuration that you selected.</P>
    > <P>AXImpactAnalysis.exe deletes the existing contents of the baseline model store to perform the analysis.</P>



7.  A list of affected objects is displayed. Click **Impact Analysis** to open the Microsoft Dynamics AX client and view detailed results of the impact analysis.
    
    You can use the **Impact Analysis** form to view details about the objects that are affected by the update, and to export the results. You can perform the following actions:
    
      - **Compare code** – Click **Compare** to open the **Comparison Results** form. From this form, the changes that were made to an object that was loaded during the impact analysis can be compared with the same object in two other layers.
    
      - **Review cross-references** – The bottom pane of the tool loads the cross-reference data for the selected object. The data that is presented resembles the data that is presented in the **Cross References Used By** view. If cross-reference data is not available, this pane provides an option to update the cross-reference data. For new objects that do not exist in the Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Object Tree (AOT), no cross-reference data is available.

8.  Export the results of the impact analysis, so that you can more quickly make changes after you install the update.
    
    The following options are available. We recommend that you select **Impact Analysis State**.
    
      - **Summary** – Save the information about the objects that are loaded in the form to an XML file that you select. Also save information about the layers where the objects exist, and the number of cross-references.
    
      - **Cross Reference Data** – Save more detailed information about the cross-references of the objects by using Resource Description Format (RDF). For more information about RDF, see [http://www.w3.org/RDF/](http://www.w3.org/rdf/).
    
      - **Impact Analysis State (IAS)** – Save the objects that are loaded in the form to an XML file. This file has an .ias file name extension. After you save the objects to an .ias file, you can load the same list of objects into the **Impact Analysis** form later. This capability is helpful when you must install a hotfix, because you might want to save the list of objects before you start the installation. After the installation is completed, you can reload the objects for additional analysis.

## Install a single update or hotfix (CU6 and earlier)

1.  Browse to the location where you extracted the files for the update, and then double-click **AxUpdate.exe**.

2.  On the **Welcome to Microsoft Dynamics AX Update Setup** page, click **Next**.

3.  On the **License terms** page, review the license terms. Select the option to accept the license terms, and then click **Next**.

4.  On the **Select components** page, in the list of components that can be updated, select the components to update, and then click **Next**.
    
    If you update a database instance, you can select the name of the instance to update the local instance. Alternatively, you can select **Other** to select a remote instance to update. In this case, a **Database instance** page is displayed, where you can select the remote instance.

5.  On the **Ready to install** page, review the summary of the components that are being updated, and then click **Install**.

6.  When the update is completed, click **Finish** to close the wizard.

7.  After the installation is completed, examine the log files that were created by AXUpdate.exe. By default, log files are saved to a subfolder of the %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Microsoft\\Dynamics AX\\Dynamics AX Setup Logs folder.

8.  Continue with the Perform post-installation steps section.

## Perform post-installation steps

The procedures in this section must be performed after the installation has been successfully completed.

## Reinitialize the model store

Many hotfixes require that you reinitialize the model store after installation. You should assume that all cumulative updates require reinitializing. The hotfix description indicates whether this step is required. You can use either Windows PowerShell or AXUtil to perform this step.

1.  On the **Start** menu, point to **All Programs**, point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Microsoft Dynamics AX Management Shell**.

2.  At the Windows PowerShell command prompt, PS C:\\\>, type the following command, and then press ENTER.
    
    ``` powershell
    Initialize-AXModelStore 
    ```
    
    This command reinitializes the default model store.
    
    For more information, see [Initialize-AXModelStore](initialize-axmodelstore.md).

## Restart AOS and Internet Information Services (IIS)

You must restart both AOS and IIS after the installation is completed.

1.  Restart the AOS service for the instance.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If labels are not displayed correctly after you start the client, you may not have restarted the AOS instance.</P>
    > <P>If you did restart the AOS and you are still not seeing correct labels, you may need to remove the .ald (label) files from the folder C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics AX\60\Server\&lt;instancename&gt;\bin\Application\Appl\Standard, and then restart the AOS.</P>



2.  If Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX is deployed in your environment, open a Command Prompt window on the Enterprise Portal server, type iisreset, and then press ENTER.
    

    > [!WARNING]
    > <P>If you do not restart IIS, you receive the following message, and Enterprise Portal is not deployed to other servers if you try to redeploy: “Could not load type ‘Microsoft.Dynamics.Framework.Portal.EPSoapSecurity’”</P>



## Complete the software update checklist

Before the changes to the model store that were included in the update can be fully implemented, you must complete additional tasks. The software update checklist helps you complete these tasks.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The software update checklist is available by default in AX 2012 R3, and in AX 2012 R2 CU7. It is also available in application hotfixes and cumulative updates that have a version number of 6.0.947.339 or higher. When you start the client, if you do not see the <STRONG>Start the software update checklist</STRONG> option that is mentioned in the following procedure, install hotfix KB2616405.</P>
> <P>The <STRONG>Merge code automatically</STRONG> checklist item is available by default in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3. It was added to the checklist in cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, in hotfix <STRONG>KB 2894100</STRONG> (Update checklist merge code feature).</P>



The **Merge code automatically** feature simplifies the process of installing hotfixes and fixing conflicts between hotfixes and the customizations in an environment. It compares the model elements in the customization layer with the corresponding elements in the hotfix and SYS layers. Where there are differences in the code between these elements, the feature attempts to resolve the differences in a way that preserves both the customization and hotfix functionality. This is not always possible, and some conflicts will require manual effort to resolve. All changes are made in the active customization layer.

When conflicts are resolved, all of the code from each layer involved in the merge appears in the customization layer with appropriate annotations. Code that the tool does not evaluate as applicable is commented, while code that is applicable and should be included in the result is left uncommented. This preserves the information used to make the merge decision so that it can be easily reviewed while still fixing compilation and functional issues in the code that resulted from hotfix installation. When conflicts cannot be resolved automatically, a TODO comment is added to the code and the code is annotated.

The typical process for using this feature is:

1.  After installing an update, open the client in the lowest layer with customizations that you want to merge hotfix changes into.

2.  Run the software update checklist.

3.  Compile the application.

4.  Click **Merge code automatically**.

5.  Specify the title for the project to be created when prompted, and then run the tool.
    
    After the comparison has completed, a form displays the results of the merge. For changes that were merged successfully, the changes should be reviewed to ensure that they are correct. For changes that remain in conflict, the user must manually investigate and merge conflicts.

6.  After resolving all conflicts, compile the application again and perform whatever functional testing is required to ensure that all conflicts have been merged.

7.  Repeat for each layer that contains customizations.

## Run the software update checklist

1.  Start the Microsoft Dynamics AX client.
    
    When you start the client, you receive the following message: “The model store has been modified.”

2.  Click **Start the software update checklist**.

3.  Complete the items on the checklist, in the order in which they are listed.

## Next steps

In your test environment, after you have installed updates on the database, AOS instance, and client, you should deploy required updates to the report server, Enterprise Portal, and retail components. For more information, see the following resources:

  - [Deploy updated reports to a report server](deploy-updated-reports-to-a-report-server.md)

  - [Deploy updates to Enterprise Portal](deploy-updates-to-enterprise-portal.md)

  - [Deploy updates in a retail environment](deploy-updates-in-a-retail-environment.md)

## Validate the update

After an update has been successfully installed, check the install log to make sure that there are no error messages and warnings that can affect the operation of the system. Test the system for the following conditions:

  - The change that was implemented by the update is working as you expected.

  - The change has not affected other areas of the system.

  - The Microsoft Dynamics AX application as a whole is working as you expected.

## Roll an update forward to the production environment

After the update has been tested, you must install the update in the production environment. You must install all binary and pre-processing hotfixes, but should roll the application changes forward to the production environment by importing and exporting the model store. Use the methodology that is described in [Deploying Customizations Across Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Environments (White paper)](deploying-customizations-across-microsoft-dynamics-ax-2012-environments-white-paper.md) and [How to: Export and Import a Model Store](how-to-export-and-import-a-model-store.md). By exporting and importing the model store, you can avoid having to compile code in the production environment.
