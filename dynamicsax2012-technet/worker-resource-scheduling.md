# Worker resource scheduling 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 provides the capability to schedule workers for a project either based on its requirements and schedule, or based on the skills and availability of workers. The worker scheduling tools in AX 2012 are designed to help you quickly find the most qualified workers who are available to work on the tasks and activities in a project. These tools also let you easily see how you can best utilize those workers during the project based on their available capacity.

This article introduces you to resources to help you understand how worker resource scheduling for projects works in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, what general setting choices you must make for projects to support resource scheduling, and how to search for and select the workers whose time you want to book for your projects.

## Choose general options, options for workers, and options for all projects

To understand how to choose system-wide and individual worker options that must be in place before you can schedule workers to project, see the resources in the following table.

## Schedule workers for projects

In all versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 you can schedule workers for project in two ways:

  - View a project schedule and find available, qualified workers to assign to its tasks

  - View a worker’s availability and find a project the worker is qualified for

In some later versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, you can choose from additional methods for assigning workers to projects. The following table contains links to resources that describe how to do this.

<td><p>Staff a project based on the skills and availability of workers.</p></td>
<td><p>You can review the capacity of each project worker in your organization, determine whether the worker is being adequately utilized, and then assign the worker to a project or activity based on the project requirements and the worker’s qualifications.</p>
