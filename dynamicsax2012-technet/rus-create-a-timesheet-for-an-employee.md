# (RUS) Create a timesheet for an employee 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

This topic describes how to create a timesheet for an employee in the current payroll period after the employee is hired. You can make manual adjustments to a timesheet that was created for an earlier payroll period retroactively using the current timesheet for the current payroll period.

The timesheet creation process starts at the beginning of the new payroll period. Timesheet details can be added or updated during the employee hiring process. You can create a timesheet to measure the planned hours for an employee, and to register employee working hours against the planned hours. Timesheets are generated automatically using work schedules, which are created by using calendars, and assigned to employees as terms of their employment.

You can also view cumulative information that pertains to employee working hours, vacations, sick leave, and business trips.
