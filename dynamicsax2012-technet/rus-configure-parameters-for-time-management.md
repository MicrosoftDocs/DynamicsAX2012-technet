# (RUS) Configure parameters for time management 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

This topic describes how to create a list of time codes for working time, overtime, idle time, vacation, sick leave, business trips, and different kinds of overtime.

Timesheets record daily working hours or a summary of working hours for a specified period. You can set up time codes for a timesheet and indicate whether they are for hourly or daily work. These time codes can be associated with time groups that allow you to track actual working hours for an employee, and absences from work.

You can specify how payment is made to an employee whether the employee is paid monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly. You can also set up the working schedule for employees by using calendars.

## Prerequisites

The following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you start.

## 1\. Configure general settings for timesheet

You can use the **Timesheet general settings** form to configure the timesheet parameters for time codes, timesheet rates, or timesheets that you generate.

To configure the default general settings for a timesheet, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Working time registration** \> **Setup** \> **Setup**.

2.  On the **General** tab, in the **Hours/days** field, select **Hours only**, **Days only**, or **Days and hours** as the default method to register the time codes.

3.  In the **Revenue recognition accounting rule** field, select **Daily** or **Summarized** as the default method to register timesheets.

4.  Select the **Online calculation** check box to specify that the payments that are related to the timesheet are calculated automatically when you make changes to the timesheet.

5.  In the **Rate 1**, **Rate 2**, and **Rate 3** fields, select the timesheet rates as the default rates.

6.  In the **Human resource manager** field, select the employee who is responsible for the creation of the timesheet.

## 2\. Create a list of time codes

You can create time codes to represent working time, idle time, vacation, sick leave, business trips, and two types of overtime. The types of overtime are payable overtime and non-payable overtime. For payable overtime, employees are paid according to a calculation sequence for every two hours beyond the regular working schedule, and are paid double-time for working on a holiday. For non-payable overtime, working extra hours increases the vacation days for employees.

To create time codes for a timesheet, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Working time registration** \> **Setup** \> **Time code list**.

2.  Click **New** to create a time code.

3.  On the **Overview** tab, in the **Time code** field, enter the time code.

4.  In the **Name** field, enter a name for the time code.

5.  In the **Hours/days** field, select **Hours only**, **Days only**, or **Days and hours** to modify the method to register time codes, if required.

6.  On the **General** tab, in the **Short description** field, enter a short description for the time code.

7.  In the **Sequence** field, select the calculation sequence that contains counters, where calculation rules are defined to calculate multiple payments for the selected time codes. For more information about counter setup, see "Set up counters for calculation sequences" in [(RUS) Set up calculation procedures for the payroll process](rus-set-up-calculation-procedures-for-the-payroll-process.md).

## 3\. Assign time codes to a special time account

You can assign time codes to special time accounts for vacation time, sick list time, or business trip time. The special time account is used to track the employee absence during the creation of the timesheet. For more information, see the RUS) Register vacations, business trips, and calculate compensation and (RUS) Register sick lists manually and calculate compensation topics.

To assign time codes to a special time account, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Working time registration** \> **Setup** \> **Setup**.

2.  In the **Timesheet general settings** form, on the **Special times account** tab, in the left pane, select **Vacation** for the special time account.

3.  In the right pane, press CTRL+N, and then select a time code for the vacation time account in the **Time code** field.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can also select <STRONG>Sick list</STRONG> or <STRONG>Business trip</STRONG> for the special time accounts, and then define their time codes in the <STRONG>Time code</STRONG> field.</P>



4.  Select the **Update** check box to update the time for the default line that is created when you generate a timesheet.

## 4\. Create time groups

You can create time groups and assign similar time codes for each time group.

3.  On the **Groups** tab, in the **Group code** field, enter the code for the time group.

4.  In the **Short description** field, enter a short description for the time group.

5.  On the **Time codes** tab, in the **Time codes** field, select the time codes to be added to the time group.

6.  Click **\<** to transfer the selected time code to the **Selected** field.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can click <STRONG>&lt;&lt;</STRONG> to transfer all of the time codes from the <STRONG>Time codes</STRONG> field to the <STRONG>Selected</STRONG> field.</P>



## 5\. Create a payment form and assign a list of time codes
