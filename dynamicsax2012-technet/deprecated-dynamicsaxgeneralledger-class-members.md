# Deprecated: DynamicsAXGeneralLedger class members 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, the **DynamicsAXGeneralLedger** class contains methods that enable specific forms to be opened in the application. Because of changes in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, two members have to be replaced to enable access to new functionality:

  - OpenGeneralLedgerBudgetWindow

  - OpenGeneralLedgerTransactionWindow

If these members are not replaced and are called on a AX 2012 installation, they will return failure.
