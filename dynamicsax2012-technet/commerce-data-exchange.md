# Commerce Data Exchange 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

Commerce Data Exchange is a system that transfers data between Microsoft Dynamics AX and retail channels, such as online stores or brick-and-mortar stores.

The database that stores data for a retail channel is separate from the Microsoft Dynamics AX database. A channel database holds only the data that is required for retail transactions. For a brick-and-mortar store, the channel database is also known as a store database and is typically located on the premises.

Master data is configured in Microsoft Dynamics AX and is distributed to channels. Transactional data is created in the point of sale (POS) system or the online store, and is then uploaded to Microsoft Dynamics AX. Data distribution is asynchronous. In other words, the process of gathering and packaging data at the source occurs separately from the process of receiving and applying data at the destination.

For some scenarios, such as price and inventory lookups, data must be retrieved in real time. To support these scenarios, Commerce Data Exchange also includes a service that enables real-time communication between Microsoft Dynamics AX and a channel.

The following table describes the components of Commerce Data Exchange.

<td><p>Commerce Data Exchange: Async Server (Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 only)</p></td>
<td><p>Async Server handles asynchronous data exchange at headquarters. Microsoft SQL Server change tracking on tables is used to determine which data must be packaged and sent to channels. Based on a distribution schedule, data packages are generated from Microsoft Dynamics AX and deposited in a working folder.</p>

<tr class="even">
<td><p>Commerce Data Exchange: Async Client (AX 2012 R3 only)</p></td>
<td><p>Async Client handles asynchronous data exchange for a channel. Data transfer is initiated by the client. At a configurable interval, Async Client polls for data to download. If there is new data, Async Client takes the data from the working folder and applies it to the local channel database.</p>
<p>Async Client also uploads sales transactions from the channel to Microsoft Dynamics AX.</p>

<td><p>Commerce Data Exchange: Synch Service (Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 and Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack)</p></td>
<td><p>Synch Service handles asynchronous data exchange at headquarters and at the channel. Based on a distribution schedule, data is packaged and sent to channels.</p>
<p>If you’re using AX 2012 R3, Synch Service is used only in an environment where you have to support previous POS versions during an upgrade (N-1).</p>
<p>If you’re using AX 2012 R2 or AX 2012 Feature Pack, see <a href="commerce-data-exchange-synch-service.md">Commerce Data Exchange: Synch Service</a> for more information.</p></td>
