# Configure mobile devices for warehouse work 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic applies to features in the <STRONG>Warehouse management</STRONG> module. It does not apply to features in the <A href="inventory-management.md">Inventory management</A> module.</P>



This topic describes how to configure the menu items that workers use to perform work on a mobile device. Menu items are displayed on the mobile device menu. The configuration of these menu items determines what the menu item is used for. You can configure menu items to do the following:

  - Process an inquiry or perform an activity, such as print a label, generate license plate numbers, start a production order, or quickly look up information about items in a location.

  - Create work that will be performed through another process. For example, receiving an item for a purchase order can create put away work for another worker.

  - Perform work that was created by another process. This is called existing work. For example, performing put away work that was created when an item was received for a purchase order.

The procedures in this topic describe how to configure a menu item for each of these activities.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Depending on the mode that you select for the menu item, and if the menu item is used to perform existing work, additional fields are available for the menu item. These include required and optional fields for the menu item. For information about the additional field selections, see the section titled “Additional menu item options” in this topic.</P>



## Enter the menu item text that is displayed in the mobile device menu

For all menu items, you must enter the text that is displayed in the mobile device menu to indicate what the menu item is used for. For example, if the menu item starts a cycle count, the name and title could be “Cycle Count.”

To enter the text that is displayed in the menu, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Warehouse management** \> **Setup** \> **Mobile device** \> **Mobile device menu items**.

2.  Click **New** to create a new menu item.

3.  In the **Menu item name** and **Title** fields, enter a name for the menu item, and the title to display on the mobile device.

## Set up a menu item for activities and inquiries

You can configure a menu item to perform general activities or inquiries that do not create work. For example, these include activities such as reprinting license plate labels, and inquiries about the items in a location.

To set up a menu item to perform general activities or inquiries, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Warehouse management** \> **Setup** \> **Mobile device** \> **Mobile device menu items**.

2.  Enter a name and a title for the menu item.

3.  In the **Mode** field, select **Indirect**.

4.  On the **General** FastTab, in the **Activity code** field, select the activity or inquiry that the menu item will perform. The following table describes the activities and inquiries that are available.

## Set up a menu item to create work for another worker or process

You can set up a menu item that will create work for another worker after an initial action is performed on the mobile device. For example, when one worker uses a mobile device to receive an item, put away work is created for another worker.

To set up a menu item that will create work, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Warehouse management** \> **Setup** \> **Mobile device** \> **Mobile device menu items**.

2.  Enter a name and a title for the menu item.

3.  In the **Mode** field, select **Work**.

4.  On the **General** FastTab, in the **Work creation process** field, select the process that will generate work. In the following table, the options are arranged by work order type.  
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Depending on your selection in the <STRONG>Work creation process</STRONG> field, additional fields are available on the <STRONG>General</STRONG> FastTab. For a description of each field, see the section titled “Additional menu item options” in this topic.</P>

## Set up a menu item to process existing work

To set up a menu item that will process existing work, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Warehouse management** \> **Setup** \> **Mobile device** \> **Mobile device menu items**.

2.  Enter a name and a title for the menu item.

3.  In the **Mode** field, select **Work**.

<td><p><strong>Allow over pick</strong></p></td>
<td><p>This option is only available in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 Cumulative Update 10 or from KB 3107010.</p>
<p>Select this option to allow users to over pick sales and transfer orders. The work user also needs to be set up to allow over picking. For more information, see <a href="set-up-mobile-device-user-accounts-for-workers.md">Set up mobile device user accounts for workers</a>.</p></td>

This is useful, for example, when a target license plate is full and the worker must add the remaining items to another license plate. The worker can click <strong>Full</strong> to indicate that the license plate is full and stop receiving picking work for it. The put location for the picked items is then displayed, and the picking work that has already been completed is moved to a new work order. The remaining picking work for the target license plate stays on the original work order.</p></td>
</tr>

<td><p><strong>Anchoring</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Select this check box to allow workers to specify a location that will override the suggested staging or loading location. All of the remaining put away work is directed to the new location.</p>
<p>For example, this is useful when a worker is to put items for order 1 in a staging location by Dock 1, but can’t because a previous load hasn’t cleared the location. Rather than waiting for the Dock 1 staging location to become available, the worker decides to use the staging location for Dock 2 instead, and overrides the suggested staging location. The put location for all remaining items for the work order is updated to the Dock 2 staging location.</p>
<p>If you select this check box, you must specify whether to anchor by shipment or by load in the <strong>Anchor by</strong> field.</p></td>

## Require workers to confirm the product, location or quantity when picking items

You can set up work confirmations that require a worker to use a mobile device to register the location or quantity when performing work in the warehouse. This helps to ensure that the worker is at the correct location, or is handling the correct quantity of items. You can also enable Microsoft Dynamics AX to automatically confirm the worker’s registration. If you enable auto-confirmation, you cannot also require confirmations for location or quantity.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you’ve installed AX 2012 R3 CU8, work confirmations also include products and product variants. Additionally, you can register confirmations by scanning a bar code. Work confirmations in earlier versions do not include products, product variants, or bar code scanning. To confirm products and product variants, you must enter an ID for the product or product variant. This can be a product ID, product search ID, external ID, GTIN, or bar code. After you enter the ID or scan the bar code, the dimensions for the product variant are displayed on the mobile device.</P>



To set up work confirmations, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Warehouse management** \> **Setup** \> **Mobile device** \> **Mobile device menu items**.

2.  Select the menu item, and then click **Work confirmation setup**.

3.  In the **Work type** field, select the work process that will use the confirmation.
