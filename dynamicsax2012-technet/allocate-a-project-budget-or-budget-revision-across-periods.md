# Allocate a project budget or budget revision across periods 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

After you enter a project budget or project budget revision, and before you submit it for approval, you can allocate the amounts across periods. If the budget or budget revision is rejected, you can also allocate the amounts before you resubmit it.

After a budget or budget revision has been allocated, you can review the allocation amounts and make adjustments to them before you submit the budget or budget revision to the approval workflow.

1.  Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Common** \> **Projects** \> **All projects**.

2.  Select or open the project for which you want to allocate the budget or budget revision.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Plan** tab, in the **Budget** group, click **Project budget**.

4.  In the **Project budget** form, on the **Action Pane**, on the **Budget** tab, click **Allocate budget**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The <STRONG>Allocate budget</STRONG> button is available only if there are unapproved budget amounts.</P>



5.  In the **Allocate budget** form, in the **Allocate from** and **Allocate to** fields, enter the first and last dates that you want to include in the budget allocation. These are usually either the first and last dates of the whole project, or the first and last dates of the current year.

6.  In the **By time period** field, select whether you want to allocate the project budget by year, quarter, or company fiscal periods within the year.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>After a transaction type has been allocated and the amounts approved, the allocation time period cannot be changed in future budget revisions.</P>



7.  Select the transaction types to allocate, and then click **Allocate**.

8.  In the **Project budget allocation** form or the **Project budget revision allocation** form, review or update the amounts that are allocated.
    

    > [!TIP]
    > <P>Use the filters and checkboxes at the top of the form to view budget amounts according to their transaction types, categories, projects, or activities.</P>



9.  When you are satisfied with the allocations, close the form.
    

    > [!TIP]
    > <P>You can review and revise the allocation again at any time before you submit the budget or budget revision. To do this, select a line on the <STRONG>Costs</STRONG> FastTab or <STRONG>Revenues</STRONG> FastTab, and then click <STRONG>Modify uncommitted allocation</STRONG>.</P>



10. When the allocation is the way that you want it, click **Submit** in the **Project budget** form to send the budget or budget revisions to the approval workflow.
