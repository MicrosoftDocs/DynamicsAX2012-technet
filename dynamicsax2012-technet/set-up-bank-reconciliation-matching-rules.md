# Set up bank reconciliation matching rules 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can set up reconciliation matching rules and reconciliation matching rule sets to help the bank reconciliation process. Reconciliation matching rules are a set of criteria that are used to filter bank statement lines and bank document lines during the reconciliation process. You can set up more than one matching rule and create a reconciliation matching rule set in the **Reconciliation matching rule sets** form. Use the **Reconciliation matching rules** form to set up the reconciliation matching rules.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Bank reconciliation matching rules are used if you are reconciling an electronic bank statement using advance bank reconciliation.</P>



  - In the **Reconciliation matching rules** form, you can select which actions and selection criteria are used when the matching rule is run.

  - In the **Actions** group, select which action will be taken when the matching rule is run during the reconciliation process.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The option that you select will determine which fields are displayed.</P>

    
      - **Match with bank document** – Create criteria to specify how the bank documents and bank statement lines are matched when the matching rule is run from the **Bank reconciliation worksheet**. The transaction lines are selected according to the additional criteria set up on the FastTabs.
    
      - **Clear reversal statement lines** – Create criteria to specify how reversal statement lines should be removed from the **Bank reconciliation worksheet** form when the matching rule is run. This option is used when the bank makes a mistake and there are two bank statement lines listed in the imported bank statement and the lines must be reconciled.
    
      - **Mark new transactions** –Create criteria to specify how new transactions should be marked on the **Bank reconciliation worksheet** when the matching rule is run.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Different selection criteria options are available, depending on which option that you select in the <STRONG>Actions</STRONG> group.</P>



  - The selection criteria that are available to set up when **Match with bank document** action is selected include the following:
    
      - **Step 1: Find statement lines** – Indicates which bank statement lines will be selected from the **Bank reconciliation worksheet** form by adding the selection fields.

  - The selection criteria that are available to be set up when the **Clear reversal statement lines** action is selected include the following:

        For example, to select only checks, select the **Bank transaction code** in the **Field** field, select the **+** in the **Operator** field, and then enter **Checks** in the **Value** field.
    
      - **Step 2: Find original statement lines** – You can add selection criteria to match bank document line to bank statement lines.
    
      - **Step 3: Find bank documents** – You can add selection criteria to match bank document lines to bank statement lines. Select the **Search bank documents** check box to search bank document transactions for the selected bank statement transaction.
