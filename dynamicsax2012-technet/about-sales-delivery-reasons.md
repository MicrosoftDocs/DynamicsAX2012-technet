In the header of the sales order, in the **Delivery reason** field on the **Delivery** FastTab, you can select your specific reason for delivering the sales order. Your selection indicates whether the delivery is a sales delivery, or whether it is, for example, a gift or a box of samples. You can print the reason for delivery on your packing slips.

You set up your reasons for delivery in the **Delivery reason** field in the **Reasons for delivery** form in the **Sales and marketing** module.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The value selected in the <STRONG>Delivery reason</STRONG> field on the sales order is printed on the packing slip only if you select the <STRONG>Shipping details</STRONG> check box on the <STRONG>Packing slip</STRONG> tab in the <STRONG>Form setup</STRONG> form in the <STRONG>Accounts receivable</STRONG> module.</P>
