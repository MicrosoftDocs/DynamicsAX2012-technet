# Run report as finished for a batch order 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Report as finished is a production stage. At this stage, some or all of the quantity for a formula item, co-product, or by-product in a batch order is produced. The inventory is physically received in stock. When you perform the report as finished process, the finished products of the batch order are posted in a Report as finished journal. You can also automatically post the Route card and Picking list journals.

## Report production as finished

1.  Click **Production control** \> **Common** \> **Production orders** \> **All production orders**.

2.  Double-click the batch order that you want to report as finished. The **Batch order** form is displayed.

3.  On the **Action Pane** in the **Production order** tab, in the **Process** group, click **Report as finished**. The **Report as finished** form is displayed.

4.  On the **General** tab, in the **Good quantity** field, enter the number of items that comply with quality standards that you want to report as finished. If you are reporting a catch weight item as finished, enter the actual weight in the **CW good qty** field.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>When you open the <STRONG>Report as finished</STRONG> form, the quantity that remains to be finished is displayed as the default. However, you can change this quantity if it is appropriate.</P>



5.  In the **Error quantity** field, enter the number of defective items to report as finished.

6.  In the **Error cause** field, select the cause of the error.

7.  If you do not expect additional items to be produced for the batch order, select **End job**. The batch order status is changed to **Reported as finished**. However, you can still report additional items as finished.

8.  If you want to bypass all validations that occur before posting the Report as finished journal, select **Accept error**. If you select this check box, you can report production quantities that differ from order quantities. Otherwise, leave the check box blank.

9.  Click **OK**. The Report as finished journal is posted, and the quantity of finished items that complies with quality standards is physically received in stock.
