# About confirmation of product receipts 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Employees, sometimes referred to as requesters, who order products, maintain their own product receipts that are unconfirmed on the Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX. When employees in a company order large volumes of products for their own consumption, they are independent of central receiving and material handling. If you are an employee who orders products, you can perform one or more of the following tasks on the Enterprise Portal:

1.  Reject the receipt of fully or partially delivered products. You can add comments to explain why product receipts were rejected. For more information, see [Reject the receipt of ordered products](reject-the-receipt-of-ordered-products.md).

2.  Confirm full or partial receipt of requested products. For more information, see [Confirm the receipt of products](confirm-the-receipt-of-products.md).

3.  Change delivery date on the selected line items. For more information, see [Change delivery date for the receipt of products](change-delivery-date-for-the-receipt-of-products.md).

4.  Create fixed asset entries of new products. This could be for a new computer, or a new desk that must be a registered fixed asset.

You are informed about incoming products or product receipts that are pending by the following types of notifications:

1.  Alerts that notify you that ordered products are scheduled to arrive, or have arrived.

2.  Alerts that notify you that the invoice of ordered products is registered but not yet confirmed.
