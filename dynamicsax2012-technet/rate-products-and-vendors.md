# Rate products and vendors 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When you order items and services from the procurement catalog in the Employee services portal, you can view ratings that workers have entered for products and vendors. You can also enter a review for other requesters to see.

You can add a user rating or comment to a product or vendor only if user ratings and comments have been configured for the procurement site. Each organization sets its own standards for evaluating vendor performance. Each organization also determines the procurement categories and products for which employees are required to enter evaluations.
