# Generate a check on a ledger account or a bank account 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can create checks and post the amounts to the ledger accounts without posting the amount to a vendor account first. This is useful when printing checks in the following situations:

  - Cash on delivery (COD) items are delivered and there is no current invoice for the item, or the supplier has not been set up in the system as a vendor. You would create a check when the items are delivered.

  - Payments to one-time vendors.

  - Payments to vendors who do not accept credit cards.

  - Payments from one bank account to another, such as funds transfers or bank loan payments.
