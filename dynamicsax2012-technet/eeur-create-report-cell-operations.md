# (EEUR) Create report cell operations 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can use the Russian Financial reports generator (FRG) to generate reports by using Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel templates. Use the **Field setup** form to indicate how the value in each report cell is calculated. The values in the cells are calculated based on the line type that is selected in the **Line type** field. The following line types are available:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Line type</p></th>
<th><p>Data source</p></th>
<th><p>Available voucher types</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Transactions</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Ledger transactions</p></td>
<td><p><strong>Balance</strong>, <strong>Credit balance</strong>, <strong>Debit balance</strong>, <strong>Turnover</strong>, <strong>Credit activity</strong>, <strong>Debit activity</strong>, <strong>Turnover in correspondence</strong>, <strong>Turnover in correspondence credit</strong>, <strong>Turnover in correspondence debit</strong>, <strong>Active balance (debit)</strong>, and <strong>Passive balance (credit)</strong></p>
<div class="alert">

One or more lines with amount calculation parameters can be created for each report cell. The lines are linked together with a mathematical operator. Use the following procedure to create report cell operations.

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The <STRONG>Operator</STRONG> field is used to set up the mathematical sign for the amount that is exported to the cell, and is also used as a mathematical sign when you set up multi-line composite vouchers. <STRONG>Credit balance</STRONG>, <STRONG>Credit activity</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Turnover in correspondence credit</STRONG> voucher types use a minus sign (<STRONG>-</STRONG>).</P>



5.  In the **Line type** field, select the data source that is used to calculate the selected line. For more information, see [(EEUR) Field setup (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj910976\(v=ax.60\)).
