# Sales cube (SalesCube) for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 and R3 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

The Sales cube for Microsoft Dynamics AX is used to report on shipped and invoiced sales order lines. This article provides details about the cube.

## Units of measure and reporting with the Sales cube

When working with Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services reports that display a quantity of an item, the appropriate unit of measure must be incorporated into the report to make sure that the quantity is correct, instead of just presenting a SUM value.

For example, the InventTrans.QTY field is expressed in the inventory unit of measure. The inventory unit of measure is stored in the InventTableModule table in Microsoft Dynamics AX for each item number. Each item number has three records with different values that represent the unit of measure (ModuleType): Sales, Inventory, and Purchase. For this purpose, use the UnitID where the ModuleType equals Inventory.

For the Quantity measure that uses the sales order unit of measure, slicing on the Units dimension separates the quantities by unit of measure.

## Deployment

The Sales cube is included in the Dynamics AX project. For information about how deploy the Dynamics AX project—and the cubes that it contains—see [Deploy the default cubes](deploy-the-default-cubes.md).

## Configuration keys

The following configuration keys are required to use all features of the Sales cube:

  - General ledger (LedgerBasic)

  - Trade (LogisticsBasic)

  - Charges (Markup)

  - Commission (Commission)

  - Price/discount (PriceDisc)

  - Retail headquarters (RetailHeadquarters)

## Tables and views

The Sales cube uses data from the following tables and views:

  - CustInvoiceJour table

  - MCRSourceCodeSetup table

  - RetailHour table

  - CustInvoiceTransExpanded view

  - CustPackingSlipTransExpanded view

  - CustTableCube view

  - InventTableExpanded view

  - MCRSourceSalesSummary view

  - PdsRebateExpanded view

  - RetailCategoryExpanded view

  - RetailChannelView view

  - RetailOMHierarchyView view

  - RetailTerminalView view

  - SalesLineExpanded view


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The MCRSourceCodeSetup table and the MCRSourceSalesSummary and PdsRebateExpanded views are used with this cube only in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3.</P>



## Measures

The Sales cube includes the following measure groups.

## Customer packing slip lines

This measure group is based on the CustPackingSlipTransExpanded view and includes the following measures.
