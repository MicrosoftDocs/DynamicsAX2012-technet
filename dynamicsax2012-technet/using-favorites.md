# Using favorites 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Favorites are a way to create shortcuts to forms, reports, and queries. As you add more favorites, you can organize your favorites into groups and folders.

If a form has one or more queries associated with it, you can include a query with your favorite for that form. For example, if the **Customers** form includes queries for open orders, pending orders, and closed orders, you can create a favorite to the form and select one of the three associated queries so that the **Customers** form will always open with one of the queries applied when you click that favorite.

## Add favorites

To add a favorite to your list of favorites, complete one of the following procedures.

### Add a favorite from the area page

1.  In the area page, right-click the form, report, or other item to add to your list of favorites.

2.  Select **Add to favorites** from the context menu.

### Add a favorite from the Navigation Pane

1.  In the Navigation Pane, right-click the form, report, or other item to add to your list of favorites.

2.  Select **Add to favorites** from the context menu.

3.  In the **Add favorite** form, modify or accept the default name of the form, report, or other item.

4.  If the form, report, or other item has one or more queries associated with it, and you want to use a query when you click that favorite, select the query to use.

5.  Select the favorites group and folder to include the new favorite in.

## Organize your favorites into folders

As you add more favorites, you can use folders to organize the favorites. For example, you could create a folder titled “Monthly” that includes your favorites for all the reports and forms that you use for monthly reporting activities.

You can move favorites between folders, delete or rename folders, and change the order of folders that appear in group.

## Create a Favorites folder

1.  Click **File** \> **Favorites** \> **Organize favorites…**.

2.  Click **Create folder**, enter a name for the folder, and then click **OK**.

## Move or modify a favorite or folder

1.  Click **File** \> **Favorites** \> **Organize favorites**.

2.  Select a favorite or folder to move, rename, or delete.

3.  To move the selected favorite or folder to a different folder, click **Move to folder** and browse to the destination folder.

4.  To rename the favorite or folder, click **Rename** and type a new name for the folder.

5.  To associate the favorite with a different query, click **Edit query**, select the query to associate with the favorite, and then click **OK**.

6.  To delete the favorite or folder, click **Delete**.

## Organize favorite items into groups

You can create favorite groups to further organize your favorites. For example, if you complete similar tasks for two different companies, you can create a group for each company and organize the folders and shortcuts within each group. By default, the **My favorites** group already exists.

## Create a new favorite group

1.  Click **File** \> **Favorites** \> **Create group**.

2.  Enter a name for the group, and then click **OK**.

## Rename, or delete a favorite group

In the Navigation Pane, right-click the group to rename or delete and select one of the following options.

  - **Rename group…** – Enter a new name for the group.

  - **Delete group…** – Delete the group and all the favorites and folders within it.
