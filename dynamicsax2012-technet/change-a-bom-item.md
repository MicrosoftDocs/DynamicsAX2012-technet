You can make changes or add new items to bills of materials (BOMs) that you select.

## Change a BOM item

1.  Click **Inventory management** \> **Periodic** \> **Bills of materials** \> **Change BOM item**.

2.  In the **To item number** field, select the item that you want to add.

3.  Click **Select** to select the items that you want to replace in all the BOMs (select **Overwrite** in the **Update lines** list), or that you want to append an item to in the BOMs (select **Append** in the **Update lines** list).

4.  Click **Edit BOM line** to see which BOMs will be affected by the changes. Delete the BOMs that you do not want to be affected by the changes.

5.  If you selected **Append**, set the **From item number valid until** calendar to specify how long the existing BOM item will be valid. Then, set the **To item number valid from** calendar to specify the date from which the BOMs with the appended item will be valid.

6.  Click **OK** to make the changes.
