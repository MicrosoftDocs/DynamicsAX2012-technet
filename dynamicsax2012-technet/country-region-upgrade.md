# Country/region upgrade 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Earlier in the process, you used the **Default country/region** form to specify for a company the default country/region to assign to address records that do not already have a specified country/region. For example, you selected a default country/region for Fabrikam, and that country/region will be assigned to any Fabrikam customer that does not already have a country/region selected for their address record. But Fabrikam has customers in multiple countries/regions, and the default country/region will not apply to all customers.

Use this form to change the country/region for individual addresses.

1.  Click **Country/region upgrade** to open the **Addresses with no country/region** form. The form contains a list of addresses that do not have a country/region assigned.

2.  Do one of the following:
    
      - To apply the same country/region to all the addresses in the list, select a country/region in the **Select a default country/region to apply** field, and then click **Apply**.
        
        You can filter the list and then apply a default country/region to the records that are displayed.
    
      - To set country/regions for addresses individually, select the address and then select a country/region in the **Country/region** field.

3.  Update other address information as necessary.

4.  Click the **Set to ready for upgrade** button.
