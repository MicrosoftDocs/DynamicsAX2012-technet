You can use the **Released products** and **View items** pages to view information about the products that have been created for your company.

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 items and products are referred to interchangeably. A product name is always associated with an item ID. The main concepts that are associated with items are product, product master and product variant.

  - Product – A fixed product definition that does not include any variations.

  - Product master – A product definition that forms the basis of product variants.

  - Product variant – Products that are based on a product master. Product variants are made distinct through the product dimension setup and through configurations.

Products are used throughout Microsoft Dynamics AX. This includes procurement, sales, and projects.

You can use the **On-hand inventory** page to view which products are on hand.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Products, product masters, and product variants can be of the type <STRONG>Item</STRONG> or <STRONG>Service</STRONG>. Only products of the type <STRONG>Item</STRONG> are listed on the <STRONG>On-hand inventory</STRONG> pages.</P>
