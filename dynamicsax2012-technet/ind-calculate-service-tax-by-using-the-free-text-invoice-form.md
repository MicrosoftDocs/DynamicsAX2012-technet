_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use the **Free text invoice** form to create and post a free text invoice for which service tax is calculated. You can specify the service code for each invoice line before you post the free text invoice.

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Free text invoices** \> **All free text invoices**.

2.  Select or create a free text invoice, and then select or create invoice lines. For more information, see [Key tasks: Free text invoices](key-tasks-free-text-invoices.md).

3.  In the **Free text invoice** form, in the **Invoice lines** area, in the **Sales tax group** and **Item sales tax group** fields, select the sales tax group and item sales tax group for the invoice line. The sales tax group and the item sales tax group for a journal line must contain tax codes that have a tax type of **Service tax**.

4.  On the **Line details** FastTab, on the **Tax information** tab, in the **Company information** field group, in the **Location** field, modify the location of the legal entity, if necessary. The address of the legal entity is updated in the **Address** field.

5.  In the **STC number** field, select the service tax code (STC) number of the legal entity. The ledger accounts for posting the service tax amounts are identified by the STC number.

6.  In the **Service code** field, select the service code for the invoice line.

If you make the payment first, the service tax amounts are posted to the interim service tax payable accounts.</P>
