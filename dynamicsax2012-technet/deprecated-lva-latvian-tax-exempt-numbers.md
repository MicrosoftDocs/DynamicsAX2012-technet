# Deprecated: (LVA) Latvian tax exempt numbers [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

For Latvian installations, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009 SP1 includes country-specific modifications that are related to tax exempt numbers for companies. A tax exempt number is a company identification number that is issued and managed by the tax authority for a country/region. You can enter a tax exempt number manually, and attach it to the record of a customer or vendor. Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 integrates the changes for tax exempt numbers that are required for Latvian installations. Therefore, the country-specific modifications are not required.

<td><p>In AX 2009 SP1, modifications to the standard functionality for tax exempt numbers helped customers follow best practices for entering and tracking tax exempt numbers. The AX 2012 functionality addresses all country-specific requirements for Latvian installations. Therefore, country-specific modifications are no longer required.</p></td>
