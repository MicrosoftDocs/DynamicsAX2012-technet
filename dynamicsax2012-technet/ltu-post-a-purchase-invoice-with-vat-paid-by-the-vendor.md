# (LTU) Post a purchase invoice with VAT paid by the vendor 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Under certain conditions, purchase VAT is calculated and paid by the vendor if the vendor is registered in Lithuania as a VAT payer. These conditions include:

  - The company is selling wood and woodenwares, such as logs, planks, or beams.

  - The company is selling ferrous/non-ferrous items or products, including waste or debris.

  - The company is bankrupt.

The purchase documents issued by United VAT companies are marked in the purchase order to indicate that the VAT is paid by the United VAT company.
