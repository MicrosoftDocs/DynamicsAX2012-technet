# (EEUR) Key tasks: Set up officials to certify financial documents 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can set up a list of officials who are responsible for certifying internal financial documents for your legal entity. These officials can be internal or external to your legal entity. External officials are also referred to as counteragents.

Internal financial documents, or primary documents, include but are not limited to customer invoices, purchase order credit notes, and general ledger deferrals. Officials are set up according to transaction type and documents that are generated from the transaction.

Data about officials is printed on documents depending on where your organization is located:

  - In Russia, the data that you enter about the officials is printed on invoices for payment, customer invoices, factures, and internal and external financial reports.

  - In the European Union (EU), the data that you enter about the officials is printed on invoices and on internal and external financial reports.
