You can perform the following tasks to calculate taxes on customer orders in Retail:

  - Calculate the central sales tax (CST), value-added tax (VAT), and service tax for customer orders, returned customer orders, and canceled customer orders. When you create a customer order in Retail POS, a sales order is generated in the Retail Headquarters. For more information, see [(IND) Create item sales tax groups](ind-create-item-sales-tax-groups.md).

  - Return a customer order completely or partially. When you return a customer order completely or partially, the complete or partial tax amounts that are posted with the customer order are reversed and updated in the **Voucher transactions** form. For more information, see [Voucher transactions (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/aa583215\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Calculate the service tax on the shipping charges that apply to a customer order or a sales quotation. For more information, see [(IND) Set up miscellaneous charges for sales orders](ind-set-up-miscellaneous-charges-for-sales-orders.md) and [(IND) Post sales transactions with multiple taxes and charges](ind-post-sales-transactions-with-multiple-taxes-and-charges.md).

  - Calculate the service tax on the cancellation charges that apply when you cancel a customer order.
