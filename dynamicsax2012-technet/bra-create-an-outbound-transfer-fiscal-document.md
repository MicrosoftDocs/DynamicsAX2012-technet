You can transfer items between warehouses that are located at the same or different fiscal establishments in the same company by using a transfer order. For more information, see [(BRA) About transfer orders](bra-about-transfer-orders.md). When you ship items to a warehouse that is located at a different fiscal establishment, or if the fiscal establishment is associated with a customer account or a vendor account, an outbound transfer fiscal document is issued.

1.  Click **Inventory management** \> **Periodic** \> **Transfer orders**.

2.  In the upper pane, click **New** to create a transfer order.

3.  In the **From warehouse** and **To warehouse** fields, select the originating warehouse and destination warehouse for the transfer of items.
    
    The **Order type** field is updated based on the values that you select in the **From warehouse** and **To warehouse** fields.

4.  On the **Fiscal information** tab, specify values in the following fields:
    
    1.  In the **Fiscal document type** field, update the type of fiscal document for the transfer fiscal document.

5.  In the lower pane, click **Add** to create a transfer order line. For more information, see [Set up transfer order lines](set-up-transfer-order-lines.md).

6.  On the **Fiscal information** tab, in the **Shipment** field group, specify values in the following fields:
    
    1.  In the **CFOP** field, select the Código Fiscal de Operações e Prestações (CFOP) code for the shipment fiscal document.
    
    2.  In the **Price** field, specify the shipment price for the item.

    4.  In the **Item sales tax group** field, select an item sales tax group for the shipment fiscal document.

7.  In the **Receipt** field group, specify values in the following fields:
    
    1.  In the **CFOP** field, select the CFOP code for the receipt fiscal document.
    
    2.  In the **Price** field, specify the receipt price for the item.
    
    3.  In the **Sales tax group** field, select a sales tax group for the receipt fiscal document.
    
    4.  In the **Item sales tax group** field, select an item sales tax group for the receipt fiscal document.

    2.  Select the **Edit lines** check box to update the transfer order lines based on the option that you selected in the **Update** field.
    
    3.  Select the **Print transfer shipment** check box to print the outbound transfer fiscal document.

9.  Click **OK** to ship the transfer order and generate an outbound transfer fiscal document. The status of the transfer order is updated to **Shipped** in the **Transfer status** field in the **Transfer orders** form.
