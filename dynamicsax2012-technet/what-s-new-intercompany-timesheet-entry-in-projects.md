# What's new: Intercompany timesheet entry in projects 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, an organization can allow a worker in one legal entity to enter hours that are worked for a project that is managed in a different legal entity, without requiring that the worker switch company data sets.

## New functionality

After AX 2012 Feature Pack is installed, a legal entity can perform the following tasks:

  - In the **Project management and accounting parameters** form, enable the functionality for intercompany timesheets.

  - In the **Transfer price (hour)** form, specify the hourly prices that the legal entity charges related legal entities for loaned workers.

  - In the **Sales price (hour)** form, specify the hourly prices that the legal entity charges customers for borrowed workers.

  - In the **Worker/project validation groups** and **Worker/category validation groups** forms, add workers from other legal entities to the legal entity’s validation setup.

By enabling the Intercompany timesheets feature, you add the following functionality:

  - Loaned workers can submit timesheet hours for project work that they perform for the legal entity that borrows them.

  - Project managers can review and approve timesheet submissions from borrowed workers. The loaning legal entity can track the amounts that are due from the borrowing legal entity.

Additionally, the Intercompany timesheets feature adds the following two new posting types:

  - **Intercompany revenue** – The account that records intercompany revenue is used by the loaning legal entity to record revenue that it receives from the loan of resources to a borrowing legal entity.

  - **Intercompany cost** – The account that records intercompany costs is used by the loaning legal entity to record the true cost that the legal entity incurs by loaning resources. An intercompany timesheet for a loaning legal entity is posted to an intercompany cost account that is offset by a payroll allocation account. By default, the financial dimensions from the worker’s profile are added to the posting entry.

## Special considerations

The invoice for intercompany time that the loaning legal entity creates cannot be sent to the borrowing legal entity through the regular accounts payable process. (In this case, the borrowing legal entity’s account is handled in the same manner as any other vendor account). Instead, the due-to and due-from amounts are recorded in ledger accounts. Based on this information, the borrowing legal entity can determine how much to pay the loaning legal entity. After the loaning legal entity settles those payments against the ledger entries, the loaning legal entity can determine which hours have been paid for.

Because of the introduction of the Intercompany timesheets feature in AX 2012 Feature Pack, the posting of timesheets is handled by the accounting framework that was introduced in AX 2012. Therefore, hour journals are no longer used to summarize subledger entries or any subsequent project transactions are that are related to timesheets. Additionally, the **Default posting level** attribute that was specific to Project management and accounting has been deprecated. If any customized solutions have been built on the timesheet functionality in AX 2012, you might have to update these solutions for AX 2012 to account for this change, even if you do not intend to take advantage of the Intercompany timesheets feature.

## Comparison with Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009

Intercompany timesheet functionality is new in AX 2012 and has changes to the following areas:

  - Hourly transfer prices and sales prices

  - Validation groups

  - Timesheet submission and approval

  - Recording of revenue and costs
