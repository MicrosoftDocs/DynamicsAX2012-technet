# About service categories 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Service categories are a type of cost category. Service categories can be posted only by using numerical quantities, such as hours or units.

There are two types of service categories:

  - General quantity itemization – Quantities that are used for distribution or allocation.

  - Internal cost allocation – Quantities that are used for calculation of labor costs in production or projects.

Both types of service categories can be linked to production or to a project.
