For more information, see the announcement on CustomerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/northamerica/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued or PartnerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/news-events/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued.

Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services lets partners and customers configure Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 by using a cloud-based, interview-style questionnaire. The questionnaire uses general terminology about business processes instead of terms that are specific to Microsoft Dynamics AX. Partners, independent software vendors (ISVs), and customers can create, maintain, and reuse configurations that reflect their custom solutions. Partners can also create additional groups of questions to enlarge the scope of a configuration.

RapidStart Services is scalable and easy to customize to suit the business processes that require configuration. By using RapidStart Services, you can reduce the time and cost of your implementation and include custom extensions in your Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 setup. Additionally, you can give your organization’s business experts control over the design of the setup and improve the overall quality of your implementation.
