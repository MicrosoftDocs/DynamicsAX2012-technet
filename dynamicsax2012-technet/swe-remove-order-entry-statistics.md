# (SWE) Remove order entry statistics 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When you track sales order entry statistics, the amount of space that is required for data storage increases. It is a good idea to periodically remove sales order entry statistics that you no longer need to keep.

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Periodic** \> **Clean up** \> **Order entry statistics cleanup**.

2.  In the **Created until** field, select a date prior to which you want to delete the order entry statistics. All order entry statistics prior to this date will be deleted.

3.  Click **OK**.
