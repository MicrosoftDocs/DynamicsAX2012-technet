# About consumption 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Select whether consumption has a variable or a constant volume or quantity.

  - **Variable** - This means that the number of units that are in the finished item is proportional to the number of items that are produced. Variable consumption is calculated as follows:  
       
    Production Quantity × Quantity (in the BOM) = Consumption (variable)
    
    The unit consumption is equal to the quantity in the BOM.  

  - **Constant** - This means that a fixed volume or quantity is required for the production, regardless of the quantity that is produced. Constant consumption is calculated as follows:  
       
    Quantity = Consumption (constant)
