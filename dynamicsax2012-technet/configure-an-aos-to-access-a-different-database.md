# Configure an AOS to access a different database 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can connect an instance of Application Object Server (AOS) to a different database. You may want to do this in the following situations:

  - You are moving from a development or staging environment to a production environment.

  - You are upgrading a Microsoft Dynamics AX system.

Before you can connect an AOS instance to a different database, you must configure permissions for the AOS account. The AOS account is the domain account or Network Service account that is associated with the AOS service.

## Connect to a different database

1.  Open the server configuration utility. Click **Start** \> **Administrative Tools** \> **Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Server Configuration**.

2.  Verify that the AOS instance and configuration that you want to modify are selected.

3.  On the **Database Connection** tab, use the lists to select a server, database, and baseline database, and then click **OK**. When you are prompted, click **Yes** to restart the AOS instance. If you do not restart the AOS instance, it does not connect to the new database.
