# Workflow for Microsoft Dynamics AX 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Microsoft Dynamics AX provides workflow functionality that you can use to ensure that documents are processed and approved in a consistent and efficient manner. This article introduces you to the workflow system in Microsoft Dynamics AX and guides you through the process of configuring, extending, and using it.

A workflow represents a business process. A workflow defines how a business document flows through the system by indicating who must process and approve it. Complete the following tasks to become familiar with the workflow system in Microsoft Dynamics AX.

<ul>
<li><p>Workflow server components no longer have to be installed on a web server that is running Internet Information Services (IIS). Workflow server components are now automatically installed when you install the Application Object Server (AOS) for Microsoft Dynamics AX.</p></li>
<li><p>A workflow editor is now available. The workflow editor is a graphical user interface that you can use to create Microsoft Dynamics AX workflows by arranging workflow elements on a design surface.
