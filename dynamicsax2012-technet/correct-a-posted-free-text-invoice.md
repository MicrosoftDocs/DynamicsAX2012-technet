# Correct a posted free text invoice 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use this procedure to correct a free text invoice that has been posted. When you correct an invoice that has been posted, a corrected invoice is created where you can modify the invoice and post it with the new values. When you post the corrected invoice, a canceling invoice is created, which brings the combined balance of the original invoice and the canceling invoice to a zero amount.

For example, if you correct an original posted invoice that has a balance of 500.00, a corrected invoice will be created that has a balance of 500.00. You can change the information for the invoice, and then post it. When the corrected invoice is posted, a canceling invoice will be created that has a balance of -500.00. This brings the combined balance of the original and canceling invoices to 0.00.
