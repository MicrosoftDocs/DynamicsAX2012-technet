# (CZE) Revalue foreign currency amounts for customers and vendors 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

When you reverse the exchange rate adjustments for a customer or a vendor, the transactions are posted to the general ledger as corrections or reverse transactions. You must select the same general ledger account and transaction type for consecutive unrealized transactions.

Before adjusting exchange rates, you must perform the following tasks:

  - Set up the local currency and exchange rates. For more information, see [Currencies (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa582902\(v=ax.60\)) and [Currency exchange rates (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh209477\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Create a customer or vendor. For more information, see [Create a customer record](create-a-customer-record.md), [Customers (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa590606\(v=ax.60\)), [Create a vendor account](create-a-vendor-account.md) and [Vendors (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa592162\(v=ax.60\)).

2.  Press CTRL+N or create a journal for the customer or the vendor.

3.  Click the **General** tab, and then select the **Reversing entry** check box to mark the transaction as a reverse transaction.

4.  In the **Reversing date** field, enter the date to post the reverse transaction.
