<td><p>Reason for deprecation</p></td>
<td><p>The report is being deprecated, because it has limited customer usage. Additionally, the <strong>Report validation results</strong> form lets users view the validation results together with the required details, and also lets users perform any required actions. Therefore, country-specific modifications are not required.</p></td>
