## See what cubes are available

To deploy the default cubes that are included with Microsoft Dynamics AX, you must deploy a Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services project. The following table lists the Analysis Services projects that you can deploy, and the cubes that they contain.

## Deploy the default cubes by using the Analysis Services Project Wizard

The following procedure explains how to deploy an Analysis Services project—and process the cubes that it contains—by using the Analysis Services Project Wizard in Microsoft Dynamics AX.

To complete this procedure, you must be assigned to the System Administrator role or the Information Technology Manager role in Microsoft Dynamics AX.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you are using the initial version of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, you must be assigned to the System Administrator role to complete this procedure. If you install <A href="https://mbs2.microsoft.com/knowledgebase/kbdisplay.aspx?scid=kb%24en-us%242579565%26wa=wsignin1.0">cumulative update 1 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012</A>, users in the Information Technology Manager role can also complete this procedure.</P>



1.  Open the Microsoft Dynamics AX client.

2.  Click **File** \> **Tools** \> **Business Intelligence (BI) tools** \> **SQL Server Analysis Services project wizard**.

3.  On the **Analysis Services project wizard** page, click **Next**.

4.  On the **Select an option** page, click **Deploy**, and then click **Next**.

5.  On the **Select an existing Analysis Services project** page, click **Select a project from the AOT**. Select the project you want to deploy from the list, and then click **Next**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You must deploy the <STRONG>Dynamics AX</STRONG> project first. After you deploy that project, you can deploy other projects.</P>



6.  On the **Deployment options** page, follow the instructions for the version of Microsoft Dynamics AX that you are using.

7.  On the **Deploying** page, click **Next** when the deployment is completed.

8.  Click **Finish** to close the wizard.

## Deploy the default cubes by using Windows PowerShell

The following procedure explains how to deploy an Analysis Services project—and process the cubes that it contains—by using Windows PowerShell.

To complete this procedure, you must meet the following requirements:

  - You must be using Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 or later.

  - You must be assigned to the System Administrator role in Microsoft Dynamics AX.

  - You must be assigned to the Administrators group on the computer from which you’ll run Windows PowerShell.

  - You must install the SQL Server 2008 R2 Analysis Management Objects (AMO) on the computer from which you’ll run Windows PowerShell. You can download AMO from this [page](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=16978).

  - You must be assigned to the Server Administrator role in Analysis Services.

  - You must be assigned to the Administrators group on the server that runs Analysis Services.

<!-- end list -->

1.  Open Windows PowerShell as an administrator by following these steps:
    
    1.  Click **Start** \> **Administrative Tools**.
    
    2.  Right-click the **Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Management Shell** option.
    
    3.  Click **Run as administrator**.

2.  View a list of the Analysis Services projects that are in the Application Object Tree (AOT) by entering the following command:
    
        Get-AXAnalysisProjectDetail
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You must deploy the <STRONG>Dynamics AX</STRONG> project first. After you deploy that project, you can deploy other projects.</P>



3.  Deploy an Analysis Services project. The Publish-AXAnalysisProject command is used to deploy and process a project. The following examples show how to use this command. For more information, see [Publish-AXAnalysisProject](publish-axanalysisproject.md).
    
      - To deploy and process a project for all partitions in your Microsoft Dynamics AX installation, enter the following command:
        
            Publish-AXAnalysisProject –ProjectName [SSASProjectName] –ServerName [SSASServerName]
    
      - To deploy and process a project for a specific partition in your Microsoft Dynamics AX installation, enter the following command:
        
            Publish-AXAnalysisProject –ProjectName [SSASProjectName] –PartitionKeys [PartitionKey1] -ServerName [SSASServerName]
    
      - To deploy and process a project for two specific partitions in your Microsoft Dynamics AX installation, enter the following command:
        
            Publish-AXAnalysisProject –ProjectName [SSASProjectName] –PartitionKeys [PartitionKey1], [PartitionKey2] -ServerName [SSASServerName]
