# (RUS) Creating an invoice that is not related to a purchase order [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can create vendor invoices that are not associated with a purchase order by using the **Vendor invoice** form. These vendor invoices can contain a mixture of invoice lines that are for purchase order lines and invoice lines that are not for purchase order lines. You can also add invoice lines that are not for a purchase order to a vendor invoice that is associated with a purchase order. The invoice and invoice lines are included in the associated facture.

The following are examples of vendor invoices that are not related to a purchase order:

  - Subscription dues

  - Commissions

  - Invoices that are created for service items
