# (BRA) About project management and accounting enhancements 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can create and post a project invoice to issue fiscal documents for a project. You can then generate a federal or municipal nota fiscal eletrônica (NF-e) from a posted project invoice. When you cancel a project invoice, the fiscal documents that are related to the invoice are also canceled.

You can perform the following tasks by using **Project management and accounting**:

  - Specify the fiscal information for a project contract, and set up service codes that are used for the project contract. For more information, see [(BRA) Specify fiscal information for a project contract](bra-specify-fiscal-information-for-a-project-contract.md).

  - Group the project transactions that you create for hour, expense, on-account, or item project transactions on fiscal document lines by criteria such as transaction text, employee, invoice type, or transaction lines, before you generate and print the fiscal documents. For more information, see [(BRA) Project management and accounting parameters (modified form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj937990\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Group fiscal document lines for project transactions by Código Fiscal de Operações e Prestações (CFOP) code. For more information, see [(BRA) CFOP matrix (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj933496\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Split project invoices based on service code when you post the invoice.
