# Define sales prices for products 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

By using trade agreements, you can specify price adjustments and discounts for one or more released products. You can also create trade agreement setups that specify individual prices for released product variants.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The search for sales prices and discounts must be enabled before you can use trade agreements. To enable the search for sales prices and discounts, select the relevant options in the <STRONG>Activate price/discount</STRONG> forms. For more information, see <A href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa575310(v=ax.60)">Activate sales price/discount (form)</A>.</P>



## Base price and price adjustments

You can set up a base sales price and price update information on the **Sell** FastTab in the **Released product details** form. A base price that is set up directly on a product is adjusted by any price information that can be derived from a trade agreement. The base price can be set up for each product and for each product master. Before you can specify price variations for product variants, a trade agreement must be associated with the product master.

## Prices that are retrieved for product variants on a sales order line

When a product variant is specified on a sales order line, a price is retrieved from the base price information for the product master, and from trade agreement adjustments.

A trade agreement can be set up for specific inventory dimensions. When you enter a product variant on a sales order line, the base price is adjusted by any trade agreement lines that match the inventory dimensions of the product variant.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>An inventory dimension must be enabled for the price search to be included in the search when price adjustments are retrieved for product variants.</P>
> <P>To enable an inventory dimension for the price search, select the <STRONG>For purchase prices</STRONG> and <STRONG>For sales prices</STRONG> check boxes for the relevant dimensions in the <STRONG>Product dimension groups</STRONG>, <STRONG>Storage dimension groups</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Tracking dimension groups</STRONG> forms.</P>
