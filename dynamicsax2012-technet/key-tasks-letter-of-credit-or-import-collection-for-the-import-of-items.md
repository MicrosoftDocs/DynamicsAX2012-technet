# Key tasks: Letter of credit or import collection for the import of items 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use the letter of credit parameters in the **General ledger**, **Accounts payable**, **Accounts receivable**, and **Cash and bank management** modules to set up and transact business functions, such as guaranteeing payments between a vendor and a buyer through a bank.

A letter of credit allows you to:

  - Generate a report of the bank facilities and their uses.

  - Generate the entries for the letter of credit.

  - Print the letter of credit application form.

  - Enter the letter of credit details.

  - Amend the letter of credit.

  - Record letter of credit margin payments.

  - Allocate a margin amount to shipments.

  - Associate a packing slip in a purchase order with the letter of credit shipment details.

  - Process a payment for the invoice.

  - View the cash flow forecast according to the letter of credit.

  - Print various reports and inquiries related to the letter of credit.

  - Generate a vendor statement.

This key task topic describes how to work with letters of credit, from the required setup to posting the invoice to make a payment.

Before you use the **General ledger parameters** form to activate the letter of credit, select the **Bank document** check box in the **Configuration** form. After you activate the letter of credit parameters, you must create the facility types, the facility groups, and the facility agreement.

After you create an agreement, you can create a purchase order for a letter of credit. In the purchase order, you can specify the letter of credit details. After you receive the shipment, you can allocate the margin amount to a particular shipment or to all the shipments related to the letter of credit. The last step for the letter of credit is to post the invoice and process the payment for the invoice.

## Create a bank facility agreement

You must create bank facility agreements that record various facilities provided by the bank. Bank documents can be used in transactions only after facility agreements are created. The bank assigns a limit for the letter of credit, which is recalculated every time a letter of credit transaction is recorded.

When a facility agreement ends, you can create a new version of the agreement, with new starting and ending dates, by extending the old agreement.

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Facility agreements cannot have overlapping dates. For example, if an agreement extends from January 01, 2011 to August 31, 2011, you cannot create another facility agreement that begins or ends within that period.</P>



5.  In the **Facility type** and **Limit** fields, select the facility type, and then enter the facility amount that was negotiated with the bank. The **Amount used** field displays the amount that is currently used for the letter of credit.

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The value in the <STRONG>Start date</STRONG> field of the extended agreement is the day after the selected agreement’s end date. The <STRONG>Amount used</STRONG> field is set to zero because this is a newly created agreement.</P>

## Create a purchase order and enter the letter of credit details

A letter of credit is associated with a purchase order to process vendor transactions with minimal manual intervention. The involved parties are the buyer (applicant), the seller (beneficiary), the issuing bank (buyer’s bank), and the advising bank (beneficiary’s bank). When a company is both the buyer and applicant for the letter of credit, the letter of credit is called an import letter of credit. Purchase orders that are associated with letters of credit are not considered for summary invoicing.

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Common** \> **Purchase orders** \> **All purchase orders**.

2.  Click **Purchase order** to create a new purchase order.

3.  In the **Create purchase order** form, select the vendor account in the **Vendor account** field.

4.  In the **Bank document type** field, select **Letter of credit**, and then click **OK**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>When the <STRONG>Bank document type</STRONG> field is set as <STRONG>Letter of credit</STRONG>, the purchase order is displayed in the list of letters of credit in the <STRONG>Cash and bank management</STRONG> module. Because the letter of credit details have not yet been added, the <STRONG>Require update</STRONG> check box on the <STRONG>Cash and bank management</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Common</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Letters of credit</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Import letter of credit/import collection</STRONG> list page is selected.</P>

## Amend the letter of credit details

If the purchase order details change, you must update the letter of credit details before you invoice the purchase order completely.

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can edit the shipment details only if the packing slip or invoice is not posted. If you delete a shipment line detail for which the margin was already allocated, the allocated amount is reversed to an unallocated amount in the <STRONG>Letter of credit margin transactions</STRONG> form.</P>



3.  Click **Confirm** to confirm the changes made to the letter of credit. Changes must be confirmed to be saved as amendments. Each confirmed amendment results in a new version of the letter of credit. This helps to track the revision history of the letter of credit. If shipment line details are changed, the letter of credit details are confirmed only if the total shipment amount does not exceed the letter of credit amount.

4.  Click **Inquiries** to open the **Letter of credit/import collection history** form, and then view the amendment history of the letter of credit.

5.  Close the forms to save your changes.

## Allocate the margin amount to the shipment

To adjust the margin amount at the time of invoicing (partially or completely), the margin amount must be allocated to each shipment. You can use the **Letter of credit margin transactions** form to allocate the margin amount across shipments for a letter of credit.

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can allocate margin amounts only if the value in the <STRONG>Balance</STRONG> field is greater than zero and the shipment that you are allocating to is not already invoiced. If you select <STRONG>Distributed</STRONG> in the <STRONG>Allocation type</STRONG> field, the shipment share of the margin amount is calculated as following:</P>
    > <P>Shipment Share = Margin amount multiplied by (Shipment amount/Letter of credit amount).</P>

## Post a packing slip and an invoice for the purchase order

After the margin is allocated to the shipment, you can post a packing slip and register an invoice for the purchase order. When you post a packing slip, you can specify the shipment number to map the shipment with the delivery. You cannot post the invoice or update a packing slip unless the letter of credit shipment line amount either equals the invoice amount or the shipment variation is within the tolerance limit specified in the **Tolerance percentage** field in the **Letter of credit / import collection** form.

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Common** \> **Purchase orders** \> **All purchase orders**.

The invoice amount must be equal to the shipment amount. The shipment status is set as **Invoiced**.

5.  Close the forms to save your changes.

## Make a payment for the invoice

After the purchase order is invoiced, you can make the payment and settle the accounts. The payment for the letter of credit must be equal to the amount due minus the margin amount because the margin amount is already collected by the bank. The payment must be within the tolerance limit for the letter of credit.

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Journals** \> **General journal**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a new journal.
