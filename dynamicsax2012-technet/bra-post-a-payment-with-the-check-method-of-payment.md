# (BRA) Post a payment with the check method of payment 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use this procedure to post a payment by using a method of payment for checks.

All the payment lines in the payment journal are grouped by vendor or bank, based on the posting level that you select for the method of payment in the **Posting level** field in the **Methods of payment - vendors** form. For more information, see [(BRA) Set up a check or Bordero method of payment for a vendor](bra-set-up-a-check-or-bordero-method-of-payment-for-a-vendor.md). To post and print one check for the payment lines that are grouped for a vendor or a bank, all the payment lines must have the same vendor or bank, payment currency, method of payment, and payment date. All the payment lines that are grouped for the vendor or the bank are updated with the same check number.
