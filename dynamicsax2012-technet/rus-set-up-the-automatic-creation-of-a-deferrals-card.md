# (RUS) Set up the automatic creation of a deferrals card 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

When you run a fixed asset issue voucher and realize a loss, you can automatically create a deferrals card. The deferrals card shows the calculated loss and the write-off period, which is defined as the difference between the depreciated object's anticipated useful life and the actual length of time that it was held before the loss was incurred.

2.  Click the **Deferrals** tab, and then set up the parameters for creating deferrals on when a loss is realized.
