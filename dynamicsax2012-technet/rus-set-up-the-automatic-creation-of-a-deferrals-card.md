# (RUS) Set up the automatic creation of a deferrals card 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

When you run a fixed asset issue voucher and realize a loss, you can automatically create a deferrals card. The deferrals card shows the calculated loss and the write-off period, which is defined as the difference between the depreciated object's anticipated useful life and the actual length of time that it was held before the loss was incurred.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic has not been fully updated for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2.</P>



1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Setup** \> **Depreciation** \> **Depreciation group**.

2.  Click the **Deferrals** tab, and then set up the parameters for creating deferrals on when a loss is realized.

3.  Select **Disposal** if you want to dispose of the fixed asset entirely, or **Partial dismantlement** to dispose of part of the fixed asset.

4.  In the **Model number** field, select the deferral model number.

5.  In the **Deferrals group** field, select the deferral group.

6.  In the **Expense code** field, select the expense code.

7.  Press CTRL+S or close the form.
