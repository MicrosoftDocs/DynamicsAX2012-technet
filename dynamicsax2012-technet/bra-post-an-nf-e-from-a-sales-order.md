# (BRA) Post an NF-e from a sales order 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can create and post a sales order to generate a Nota Fiscal eletrônica (NF-e). When you post the sales order, an NF-e XML file is generated and submitted to the Secretaria da Fazenda (SEFAZ).

After the status of the NF-e is received from SEFAZ, you can perform the following tasks:

  - If the NF-e is approved, you can print the Documento Auxiliar da Nota Fiscal Eletrônica (DANFE). Alternatively, if you selected the **Print DANFE when NF-e is approved** check box on the **NF-e federal** FastTab in the **Fiscal establishments** form, the DANFE is printed automatically. For more information, see [(BRA) Verify the NF-e status and print the DANFE](bra-verify-the-nf-e-status-and-print-the-danfe.md) and [(BRA) Set up NF-e parameters for a fiscal establishment](bra-set-up-nf-e-parameters-for-a-fiscal-establishment.md).

  - If the NF-e is denied, you must cancel the NF-e. For more information, see [(BRA) Cancel a customer NF-e](bra-cancel-a-customer-nf-e.md).

  - If the NF-e is rejected and can be fixed, you can correct the incorrect information. You can then click **Resend** on the **NF-e federal** tab on the **Action Pane** in the **Fiscal document** form to resend the NF-e to SEFAZ.

  - If the NF-e is rejected and cannot be fixed, you must cancel the NF-e.
