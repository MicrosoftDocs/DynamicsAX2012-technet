<td><p>Relieve encumbrances when you confirm purchase orders.</p></td>
<td><p>When you confirm a purchase order that is generated from one or more pre-encumbered purchase requisition lines, the purchase order is posted to the general ledger. Any pre-encumbrances are also relieved.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="about-purchase-order-encumbrances.md">About purchase order encumbrances</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Reason codes for purchase order transactions</p></td>
<td><p>You can now add reason codes to the posting transactions for purchase orders. Reason codes help explain why transactions were entered, such as why an order was returned, or why the amount that was received differs from the amount that was ordered.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="about-financial-reason-codes.md">About financial reason codes</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Record purchase order encumbrances in the general ledger.</p></td>
<td><p>When you confirm a purchase order, you can record the encumbrances in general ledger accounts. Therefore, you can accrue liabilities.</p>
<p>Most public sector organizations record encumbrance transactions to record accruals of liabilities for committed, or obligated, purchases. In the <strong>General ledger parameters</strong> form, you can select the <strong>Enable encumbrance process</strong> check box to activate recording in ledger accounts. The ledger accounts that you record in are specified by posting definitions, and you associate these ledger accounts with the purchase order transaction by using the <strong>Transaction posting definitions</strong> form.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="encumber-purchase-orders.md">Encumber purchase orders</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>View and track encumbered amounts on purchase orders.</p></td>
<td><p>When the encumbrance process is enabled, you can view the encumbered amounts, encumbrances that are relieved through invoice processing, and encumbered amounts that remain after invoice processing.</p>

<td><p>Create reports that group vendor invoices or customer invoices by a selected financial dimension.</p></td>
<td><p>The <strong>Open invoice transactions</strong> report and the <strong>Sales invoice journal</strong> report have been changed. These reports are now the <strong>Vendor invoice transactions</strong> report, which is created in Accounts payable, and the <strong>Customer invoice transactions</strong> report, which is created in Accounts receivable. You can create the reports to group transactions by a selected financial dimension. You can select invoices for both reports by using various criteria. Both reports include options to select invoices by date or date range, and you can display all invoices, only paid invoices, or only invoices that are in an open state.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="vendor-invoice-transactions-report-vendinvoice.md">Vendor invoice transactions report (VendInvoice)</a> and <a href="customer-invoice-transactions-report-custinvoice.md">Customer invoice transactions report (CustInvoice)</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Create a reconciliation report of purchase order encumbrances.</p></td>
<td><p>You can create a reconciliation report that is grouped by the general ledger chart of accounts dimension that you select. This report identifies differences between budget reservations for encumbrances and the corresponding encumbrances that are tracked in the general ledger. You can view either a detailed version of the report or only the differences. The detailed version shows totals by transaction or document number for all encumbrances. The version that displays differences shows only instances where the budget reservation amount for encumbrances does not balance with the corresponding encumbrance accounts in the general ledger.</p>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Accounts payable payments and payment clearing</p></td>
<td><p>You can use posting definitions to record vendor payments for vendor invoices and promissory notes. For example, you can record a vendor payment by posting a vendor payment journal. The vendor payment journal can generate multiple transactions, and uses the distributions on the vendor invoice and the posting definitions to support pooled cash accounting. When bridged costing is enabled on the method of payment, you can use a clearing account for payments to track checks or warrants that have been issued, but that have not yet cleared the bank.</p>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Simplified calendar options</p></td>
<td><p>You can use the streamlined <strong>Fiscal calendars</strong> form to create multiple calendars in Accounts payable, Accounts receivable, General ledger, Project, and Inventory management. You can maintain all calendar types, even fixed asset calendars and fiscal year calendars, in one form. You can also define multiple closing periods for a specific date. This feature helps you better track and report on multiple audit adjustments.</p>
<p>For more information, see the white paper <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/0/e/f0e719b8-aded-4157-b31b-d036f8308f1f/microsoft+dynamics+ax+shared+financial+data+management+white+paper.pdf">Shared financial data management for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Enhancements to fiscal periods</p></td>
<td><p>Many enhancements have been made to the functionality for fiscal periods. You can now use multiple fiscal years, enter multiple closing periods that have the same starting and ending dates, and copy the setup of periods to the next year. You can also change a sequence of months more quickly. To support these enhancements, the <strong>Periods</strong> and <strong>Fixed asset calendars</strong> forms have been removed, and fiscal period functionality is included in the <strong>Fiscal calendars</strong> and <strong>Ledger calendar</strong> forms.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="about-fiscal-calendars-fiscal-years-and-periods.md">About fiscal calendars, fiscal years, and periods</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Create shared fiscal calendars that can be used by different entities.</p></td>
<td><p>You can create and use calendars that are independent of your organization and shared by multiple legal entities. An organization can create one or more calendars that can be used by different legal entities that are part of the organization.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="key-tasks-fiscal-calendars-fiscal-years-and-periods.md">Key tasks: Fiscal calendars, fiscal years, and periods</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>New Treasurer Role Center</p></td>
<td><p>The Treasurer Role Center is a default home page that provides an overview of information that pertains to your work, such as your work list, frequently used links, and KPI information. The Treasurer Role Center includes two new KPI reports: Treasurer asset analysis (TreasurerAssetAnalysis) and Treasurer liabilities analysis (TreasurerLiabilitiesAnalysis).</p>
<p>The Treasurer Role Center has the same four KPIs that the Role Centers for the controller, CFO, accountant, and accounting manager have, but the reports match the treasurer title: Treasurer profitability analysis, Treasurer operational efficiency, Treasurer short-term solvency, and Treasurer long-term solvency. This Role Center also has pie charts for check information and outstanding debt, and a Fixed asset replacements list report. This Role Center uses existing General ledger cube measures and dimensions.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Updates to posting definitions</p></td>
<td><p>If your organization requires multiple offsetting entries for transactions, you can set up posting definitions that determine the balanced set of ledger posting entries that is generated, based on the originating entry for a transaction. You can set up posting definition versions that have date-effective ranges, and the criteria for matching account numbers can include account structures, dimensions that are enabled for budgeting, and accounts that are generated from account rules. You can use transaction posting definitions to specify the posting definitions that are used, and to assign those posting definitions to transaction posting types.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="about-posting-definitions.md">About posting definitions</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>New distributions and budget-related functionality for year-end processing</p></td>

After a balancing financial dimension is defined on the ledger, every accounting entry is validated to make sure that it is also balanced at the financial dimension level. If any financial dimension values are unbalanced, interunit due-to and interunit due-from account entries are generated to balance the accounting entry.</p>
