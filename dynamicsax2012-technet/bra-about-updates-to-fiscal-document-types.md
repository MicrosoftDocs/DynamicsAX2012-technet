# (BRA) About updates to fiscal document types 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can specify the type of fiscal document that is used in sales and purchase transactions between fiscal establishments. The fiscal document type defines the number sequence, series, document model, specie, and layout of the fiscal documents.

You can perform the following tasks:

  - Set up fiscal document types that can be used in sales and purchase transactions. You can modify a fiscal document type only if there is no existing transaction that uses the fiscal document type. For more information, see [(BRA) Set up fiscal document types](bra-set-up-fiscal-document-types.md).

  - Specify the default fiscal document type for customers and vendors. For more information, see [(BRA) Assign fiscal document types for customers or vendors](bra-assign-fiscal-document-types-for-customers-or-vendors.md).

  - Specify the fiscal document type for sales orders, purchase orders, and free text invoices. For more information, see [(BRA) Create and post a sales order](bra-create-and-post-a-sales-order.md) and [(BRA) Create and post a free text invoice](bra-create-and-post-a-free-text-invoice.md).
