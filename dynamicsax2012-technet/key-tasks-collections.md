# Key tasks: Collections 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Managing and collecting for overdue transactions is a necessary function in many organizations. Most collections functionality is centralized in the **Collections** form and on the following related list pages: **Collections**, **Collections activities**, and **Collections cases**.

Sometimes one person handles a company’s collections for all customers. In other situations, a team of collections agents works together to manage collections. If your business needs require it, you can set up collections agents. Each collections agent can be assigned one or more customer pools, which is a query that contains a set of customers. For example, a collections agent might be responsible for customers 4000 through 4500.

## View collections information

By default, Microsoft Dynamics AX users have access to all records that are shown on the collections list pages. If customer pools have been created, they can be used to filter the records. You can also set up collections agents, which are workers who are set up as users in the **User relations** form. Collections agents can filter information by using the customer pools that are assigned to them, or clear the filter field to view all records.

### View customer information on the Collections list page

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Collections** \> **Collections**.
    
    The columns on the list page display customer balances and aged amounts by aging period. This information is stored in an aging snapshot. The aging periods are determined by the aging period definition that is used. The aging period definition is taken from the customer pool, if one was specified for the pool query. If the pool does not have an aging period definition, the default aging period definition that is specified in the **Accounts receivable parameters** form is used.

2.  Select a customer.

3.  On the **Collect** tab, click buttons in the **Journals** or **View** groups to view transactions, activities, or cases that are associated with the selected customer account.
