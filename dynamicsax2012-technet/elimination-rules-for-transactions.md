# Elimination rules for transactions 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Elimination transactions are required when a parent legal entity does business with one or more subsidiary legal entities and uses consolidated financial reporting. Transactions that occur between legal entities that are part of the same organization must be eliminated, because consolidated financial statements must include only transactions between the consolidated organization and other entities outside that organization. Therefore, transactions between legal entities that are in the same organization must be removed, or eliminated, from the general ledger so that they do not appear on financial reports.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>We recommend that you use Management Reporter for Microsoft Dynamics ERP to combine the financial results for multiple legal entities in a consolidated format. Management Reporter lets you create consolidated financial reports across legal entities, use Microsoft Excel to import consolidation data from other sources, and translate amounts into any number of reporting currencies without having to run the consolidation process in Microsoft Dynamics AX.</P>
> <P>For more information about how to consolidate transactions by using Management Reporter, see <A href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=389548">Financial consolidations and currency translation</A>.</P>



You can set up elimination rules to create elimination transactions in a legal entity that is specified as the destination legal entity for eliminations. This destination legal entity is known as the elimination legal entity. Elimination journals can be generated either during the consolidation process or by using an elimination journal proposal.

Before you set up elimination rules, you should become familiar with the following terms:

  - Source legal entity – The legal entity where the amounts that are being eliminated were posted.

  - Destination legal entity – The legal entity where elimination rules are posted.

  - Elimination legal entity – The legal entity that is specified as the destination legal entity for eliminations.

  - Consolidated legal entity – The legal entity that is created to report financial results for a group of legal entities. The financial data from the legal entities is consolidated into this legal entity, and then a financial report is created by using the combined data.

The following table shows the types of transactions that might have to be eliminated.

## Example

Your legal entity, legal entity A, sells widgets to another legal entity in your organization, legal entity B. The following example shows how transactions that occur between the two legal entities might have to be eliminated:

  - Legal entity A sells a widget that costs 10.00 to legal entity B for 10.00.

  - Legal entity A sells a widget that costs 10.00 to legal entity B for 10.00, plus 2.00 in actual shipping costs.

  - Legal entity A sells a widget that costs 10.00 to legal entity B for 15.00 and recognizes a margin on the sale.

  - Legal entity A sells a widget that costs 10.00 to legal entity B for 15.00 and recognizes half of the margin on the sale. Legal entity B recognizes the other half of the margin on the sale. As a result, the revenue is split. Split revenue provides an incentive to order from another legal entity in the organization instead of from an external organization.

All these transactions create intercompany transactions that are posted to due-to and due-from accounts. In addition, these transactions might include markup and markdown amounts when the amount of the intercompany sale is not equal to the cost of the goods that were sold.
