# Set up electronic signatures 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Before using electronic signatures, the Microsoft Dynamics AX administrator must enable the Electronic Signature configuration key in the **Configuration** form. (Click **System administration** \> **Setup** \> **Licensing** \> **License configuration**.)

After the configuration key has been enabled, the administrator must set up electronic signature parameters. The administrator must also set up reason codes, select the processes that will require signatures, and give user groups the appropriate security permissions.

After the administrator has set up the system, users must request certificates and set up passwords for them. Then, users can sign documents electronically.
