# (RUS) Receive a group of fixed assets from another company 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can register the receipt of several fixed assets or inventory assets at a time by using transfer journals. This can be done when the transferring company has posted asset numbers in the FA journal. If information about value models is not displayed, you must enter or modify the information manually.

2.  On the **Overview** tab, press CTRL+N.

3.  In the **Date** field, enter the date of the transfer of the assets from the other company.

    > [!NOTE]

Otherwise, you must enter or modify the information manually.</P>



7.  Click **Create fixed asset**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>This button is available only if an asset number is displayed in the <STRONG>Source</STRONG> field, but no destination is selected. This may occur if the recipient is not specified in the asset transfer transaction to another company.</P>



8.  In the **Create fixed asset** form, select the FA group that the asset belongs to. An inventory number for the fixed asset or inventory asset will be assigned automatically.

9.  Click **OK**. An asset record will be created and a destination will be displayed.

10. In the **Lines of FA transfer journal** form, click **Creating from issue** to automatically create lines in the **Receipt from another company** form.

11. Select the journal in the upper pane of the **Adding fixed assets from issue journals for another company** form, and then click **Copy journal** to copy all the information from the specified transfer journal into the receipt journal.
