# About picking routes 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This topic applies to features in the **Inventory management** module. It does not apply to features in the [Warehouse management](warehouse-management.md) module.

Operators who physically pick items from the warehouse for shipping use picking routes.

The picking route takes into account the different parameters that are set up for the warehouse, such as:

  - Zones.

  - Height of locations.

  - The direction in which to drive the truck in the warehouse.

  - The sorting code that is used to indicate the best route through inventory.

Activate picking routes from the **Shipments** form. Whole pallets will start a pallet transport; otherwise, a picking route is started. You can set up the pallet quantity on the item in the **Released product details** form.
