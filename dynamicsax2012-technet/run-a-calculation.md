# Run a calculation 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

1.  Click **Cost accounting** \> **Journals** \> **Flexible budgeting**.

2.  In the **Flexible budgeting** form, click **Calculation** to calculate plan costs. The following cost value types are calculated:
    
      - **Basic plan costs**
    
      - **Flexible plan costs**
    
      - **Target costs**

The concept resembles the period calculation that is used for actual and budget costs.

Before you run a calculation, you must create distributions, allocations, or cost rate calculations by using the calculation version that is set up specifically for the flexible budget. The calculations are based on the plan calculations.
