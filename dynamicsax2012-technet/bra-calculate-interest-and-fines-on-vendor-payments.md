# (BRA) Calculate interest and fines on vendor payments 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can apply interest and fines on vendor payments that are delayed. The interest and fine amounts that apply to a payment can be calculated when you make a payment to a vendor. Before you calculate interest or fine codes for vendor payments, you must set up a list of bank holidays and national holidays. A holiday date that is set up in the **Payment calendar** form is considered a non-working day. If an invoice is due on a non-working day, the due date moves to the next working day in the calendar, and the interest and fines are calculated accordingly. For more information, see the “Set up a payment calendar and payment calendar rules” section in [(BRA) Set up interest and fines for vendor payments](bra-set-up-interest-and-fines-for-vendor-payments.md). The interest and fine amounts can be calculated in two ways:

  - Automatically calculate the interest and fines – Set up the interest and fine codes to calculate interest automatically, based on the rates and terms that are defined for the codes. You can define a default interest code and fine code for a vendor, and attach the interest code and fine code to purchase orders. For more information, see [(BRA) Interest codes (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj933502\(v=ax.60\)) and [(BRA) Fine codes (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj933504\(v=ax.60\)). The automatic calculation of interest and fines takes into consideration the interest and fine codes, and the configuration of the payment calendar. For more information, see [About payment calendars](about-payment-calendars.md) and [Payment calendar configuration - vendors and customers (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj677400\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Manually enter the interest and fines – Enter the interest and fine amounts on the payment lines, in either the **Settle open transactions** form or the **Vendor payment proposal** form. For more information, see [(BRA) Settle open transactions - vendor (modified form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj683239\(v=ax.60\)) and [(BRA) Vendor payment proposal - Edit (modified form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj937995\(v=ax.60\)).
