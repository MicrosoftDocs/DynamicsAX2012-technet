# (FRA) About commitments (Public sector) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Commitments are used to reserve budgeted amounts so that an organization can explicitly track budget reservations for management and reporting throughout the expenditure cycle. When commitments are used as part of the budgeting process, each purchase agreement, purchase order, and vendor invoice is associated with at least one commitment. The commitment is relieved when the purchase order is confirmed or when funds are released from the purchase agreement. When an invoice does not reference a purchase order or purchase agreement, the commitment associated with the invoice is relieved when the invoice is posted.

In addition, a commitment may specify a vendor. When a vendor is specified, any purchase order, purchase agreement, or vendor invoice that references the commitment must have the same vendor.

## Using commitments

To create commitments, you must activate the budget control configuration, turn on budget control, and confirm an original budget. For more information, see [(FRA) Key tasks: Commitments (Public sector)](fra-key-tasks-commitments-public-sector.md).

Commitments are valid from the date they are created through the end of the fiscal year or until they are closed. Commitments cannot be carried over from one fiscal year to the next. For more information, see [(FRA) Process purchase order encumbrances and commitments at year end (Public sector)](fra-process-purchase-order-encumbrances-and-commitments-at-year-end-public-sector.md).
