# About RFID 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a data-collection technology that uses electronic tags to store identification data and a no-line-of-sight requirement reader to capture the identification data.

RFID tags and readers communicate with each other through radio waves. A tag is a chip that has an antenna. Tags are active, which means that they are battery-powered, or passive, which means that they use the strength of the reader signal to be enabled. Information on the tag is reprogrammable in certain types.

The tag level in Microsoft Dynamics AX is item, case, or pallet.
