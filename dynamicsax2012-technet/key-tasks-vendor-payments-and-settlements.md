## Pay an invoice based on the invoice amount

Use this procedure when you know which invoices to pay, but you do not know the payment amount. This procedure shows how to pay a vendor invoice by check.

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Journals** \> **Payments** \> **Payment journal**.

2.  Create a journal, and then click **Lines** to open the **Journal voucher** form for payment journal lines. For information about how to create journals, see [Create and validate journals and journal lines](create-and-validate-journals-and-journal-lines.md).

3.  In the **Account** field, select the vendor account to which a payment will be issued.

4.  Click **Functions** \> **Settlement**.

5.  In the **Settle open transactions** form, select the **Mark** check box on the line for each vendor invoice that you want to pay.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>To make a partial payment, you can enter the amount to pay in the <STRONG>Amount to settle</STRONG> field.</P>



6.  Close the **Settle open transactions** form. The payment line that has information from the invoice is displayed in the **Journal voucher** form. The amount on the payment line contains the amount from the vendor invoice that the legal entity can pay to the vendor. The cash discount that applies to this payment, if any, is included.

7.  Verify that you want to pay the amount to the vendor, and then click **Functions** \> **Generate payments**.

8.  Depending on the method of payment on the journal line, select either the payment method or the export format, and select the bank account from which the payment is drawn. If you select a payment method, the payment method must have an export format associated with it.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>In the <STRONG>Journal voucher</STRONG> form, you can click <STRONG>Inquiries</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Balance control</STRONG> to verify that the bank account can cover the payment to the vendor.</P>



9.  In the **Generate payments** form, click **Dialog**, fill in the fields, and then click **Document** to specify a printer destination.

10. Click **OK** to close the **Printer setup** form, and then click **OK** to close the dialog box.

11. In the **Generate payments** form, click **OK**.

12. Click **Validate** \>**Validate voucher only** to validate the payment line, and then click **Post** \> **Post and transfer**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If you cannot post and you receive a message that mentions posting restrictions, you might be able to post only journals that you create. For more information, see <A href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh227598(v=ax.60)">Posting restrictions (form)</A>.</P>
