# Set up RFM analysis 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to set up a Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis of your customers. RFM analysis is a marketing tool that your organization can use to evaluate the data that is generated by customer purchases. After you set up RFM analysis, customers are assigned a calculated RFM score as they make purchases. The RFM score can be a three-digit rating or an aggregate number, depending on how your organization has configured RFM analysis.

If your organization uses the three-digit rating, the first digit is a rating of the recency of a customer purchase. The second digit is a rating of the frequency with which the customer makes purchases from your organization. The third digit is a rating of the monetary amount that the customer spends when they make purchases from your organization. For example, a customer might have a rating of 535. If your organization has set ratings on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest, this rating tells you the following about the customer:

  - Recency score of **5** – The customer made a purchase recently.

  - Frequency score of **3** – The customer purchases products from your organization with moderate frequency.

  - Monetary score of **5** – When the customer makes a purchase, they spend a significant amount of money.

If your organization uses an aggregate of the numbers, the scores are added together. In this case, the same customer would have a rating of **13** (5 + 3 + 5).

## Set up RFM analysis

Use this procedure to set up RFM analysis for the customers in your organization.

1.  Click **Call center** \> **Periodic** \> **RFM analysis**.

2.  In the **RFM analysis**, click **New**, and then, in the **RFM definition** field, enter a name for the RFM definition. For example, you could call the definition RFM-A.

3.  Enter a start and an end date for this RFM definition.

4.  On the **General** FastTab, do the following:
    
      - If each section of the RFM score must contain an equal count of customers, select the **Even distribution** check box.
    
      - Select the **Add scores** check box to aggregate the three scores. This, for example, would give a customer an RFM score of 13 instead of 535.
    
      - Select the **Save history** check box to require Microsoft Dynamics AX to save the statistical data for customers so that the data can be used to calculate the RFM score.

5.  On the **Recency** FastTab, do the following:
    
      - In the **Divisions** field, enter the number of divisions, or groups, that will be used to calculate the recency score for customers. For example, if you have 100 customers, a division of 5 means that there are 20 customers for each score. The 20 customers who have made purchases most recently have a recency score of 5. The next 20 customers have a recency score of 4, and so on. If you have 50 customers, 10 customers have a recency score of 5, 10 have a recency score of 4, and so on.
    
      - In the **Priority** field, select how much weight to give the recency parameter in relation to the other parameters when the RFM score is calculated for a customer. For example, you might place more value on the recency score than the monetary score.
    
      - In the **Multiplier** field, enter the value by which to multiply the recency score. If you do not enter a value, the score will not be multiplied.
    
      - In the **Period** field, select the time period by which the recency score is calculated. For example, by week or by month.

6.  On the **Frequency** FastTab, do the following:
    
      - In the **Divisions** field, enter the number of divisions, or groups, that will be used to calculate the frequency score for customers.
    
      - In the **Priority** field, select how much weight to give the frequency parameter in relation to the others when the RFM score is calculated for a customer.
    
      - In the **Multiplier** field, enter the value by which to multiply the frequency score. If you do not enter a value, the score will not be multiplied.

7.  On the **Monetary** FastTab, do the following:
    
      - In the **Divisions** field, enter the number of divisions, or groups, that will be used to calculate the monetary score for customers.
    
      - In the **Priority** field, select the priority select how much weight to give the monetary parameter in relation to the others when the RFM score is calculated for a customer.
    
      - In the **Multiplier** field, enter the value by which to multiply the monetary score. If you do not enter a value, the score will not be multiplied.
    
      - In the **Gross/net** field, select whether the customer’s monetary score should be calculated by using the gross or net invoice amount.
    
      - If a customer’s return amounts should be subtracted from the customer’s total invoice calculation, select the **Subtract returns** check box.
