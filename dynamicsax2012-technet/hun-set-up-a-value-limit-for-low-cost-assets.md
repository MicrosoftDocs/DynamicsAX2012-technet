# (HUN) Set up a value limit for low-cost assets 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

A low-cost asset is an asset for which the acquisition cost does not exceed a predefined amount. Hungarian tax law defines the limit for low-cost assets. These assets can be fully depreciated immediately.

Use this procedure to enable immediate depreciation by specifying the value limit for low-cost assets. Depreciation is automatically generated for a low-cost asset when you create the acquisition.

1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Setup** \> **Fixed assets parameters**.

2.  In the **Fixed assets** area, on the **General** FastTab, in the **Low-cost asset threshold** field, enter the value limit for the low-cost asset. This value cannot exceed 100,000.
