[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

List pages provide a quick and easy way to view a group of similar records and perform actions against those records.

## Display a list page

List pages are displayed in the content pane of the Microsoft Dynamics AX application workspace.

1.  In the Microsoft Dynamics AX application workspace, click a module button in the Navigation Pane to display the list pages, forms, and reports that are available for that module.

2.  In the **Common** section on the area page, click a list page to display.

## Open a record from a list page

For some records, you must open the record to complete tasks associated to that record or to view additional information. Complete the following procedure to open a record from a list page.

1.  Display a list page.

2.  Locate the record in the grid to open and then double-click the record. The record will open in either the view mode or the edit mode, depending on the personal settings that you specified in the **Options** form.
    
    To open the record in edit mode, regardless of your personal settings, on the **Action Pane**, click **Edit**.

## Add columns to the list page grid

Use the **Personalization** form to add columns to a list page. The columns that you select are added only to your view of the list page. Other users' list pages are not affected. For more information about personalizing forms, see [Personalization (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/aa597239\(v=ax.60\)).

1.  Display a list page.

2.  Right-click in the grid and then click **Personalize**.

3.  In the **Layout** section, select a column in the grid.

4.  Click **Add fields**.

5.  Select a column in the list and then click **Add**. The new column is added after the column that you selected in step 3.

## Reposition a column in the list page grid

You can reposition the columns that are available in the list page grid by dragging and dropping the column name from one position to another in the **Personalization** form.

## Export list page data to Microsoft Excel

You can export list page data to a Microsoft Excel workbook so that you can print the data or create PivotCharts or PivotTables using the data. For more information, see [Using the Microsoft Dynamics AX Add-in for Excel](using-the-microsoft-dynamics-ax-add-in-for-excel.md).
