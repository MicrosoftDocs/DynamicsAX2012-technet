# What's new: User interface changes 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The user interface consists of features and commands that a user can use to interact with the software, especially to enter and view data and personalize forms. The user interface has changed considerably since Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009.

## New functionality

The user interface for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 is cleaner and more consistent, and can easily be adapted to specific tasks and forms. You can view important information on one central list page. Related information is displayed on FastTabs and in FactBoxes, even if the related information is not displayed in the current form. Additionally, you can more easily sort and personalize the data that is displayed.

## Comparison with AX 2009

The user interface has changed considerably since AX 2009. AX 2012 includes changes to the following areas:

  - Navigation

  - List pages

  - Filter functionality

  - Forms

  - Search
