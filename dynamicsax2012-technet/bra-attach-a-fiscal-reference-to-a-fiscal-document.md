# (BRA) Attach a fiscal reference to a fiscal document 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Brazilian legal entities can submit their fiscal and ledger information as Sistema Público de Escrituração Digital (SPED) fiscal reports. These reports also contain information about fiscal references that link several fiscal documents. These references are reported in Notas fiscais eletrônicas (NF-e) that are issued by Brazilian legal entities.

Before you generate the SPED fiscal report or NF-e, you can create fiscal references that link fiscal document references during the posting of a fiscal document. You can reference only the posted fiscal documents that are issued or received by the same fiscal establishment that issues or receives the fiscal document that is about to be posted.
