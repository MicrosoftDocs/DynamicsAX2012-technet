# About customer invoices, free text invoices, and pro forma invoices 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A customer invoice for a sales order is a bill that an organization gives to a customer in connection with a sale. You create this kind of customer invoice based on a sales order, which includes order lines and item numbers. Item numbers are specified and posted in the ledger. Subledger journal entries are not available for a customer invoice for a sales order.

A free text invoice is not related to a sales order. It contains order lines that include ledger accounts, free-text descriptions, and a sales amount that you enter. You cannot enter an item number on this kind of invoice. You must enter the appropriate sales tax information. A main account for the sale is indicated on each invoice line, which can be distributed to multiple ledger accounts by clicking **Distribute amounts** in the **Free text invoice** form. Also, the customer balance is posted to the summary account from the posting profile that is used for the free text invoice.

A pro forma invoice is an invoice that is prepared as an estimate of the actual invoice amounts before the invoice is posted. You can print a pro forma invoice for either a customer invoice for a sales order or for a free text invoice.
