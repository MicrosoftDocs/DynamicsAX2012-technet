# Create bar codes for products (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to create bar codes for products.

Before you can create bar codes, you must complete the following:

  - [Set up bar code mask characters (Retail essentials)](set-up-bar-code-mask-characters-retail-essentials.md)

  - [Set up bar code masks (Retail essentials)](set-up-bar-code-masks-retail-essentials.md)

  - [Create bar code setups (Retail essentials)](create-bar-code-setups-retail-essentials.md)

To create bar codes for products, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Retail essentials** \> **Inventory management** \> **Setup** \> **Bar codes and labels** \> **Bar codes**.

2.  In the **Item - bar code** form, click **New**, or press CTRL+N to create a new bar code for a product.

3.  On the **General** tab, under **Item**, select the item number, dimension number, quantity, and unit of the product that you are creating the bar code for.

4.  Under **Bar code**, select the bar code to use.

5.  Under **Setup**, select the setup for the bar code.
    
    If you want the bar code number to appear on the **Retail** FastTab of the **Released product details** form, select the **Display** check box. If this check box is not selected for any bar code number, Retail essentials automatically displays the shortest bar code number for the item.

6.  Under **Product dimensions**, specify the product's dimensions.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Retail essentials, the form that you use to complete this task includes a subset of the controls that are available for other configurations of Retail. If a topic about this form describes controls that you don't see, it may be because youâ€™re using Retail essentials.</P>
