## Set up production parameters – General parameters

Production parameter settings should always reflect your production environment. Production parameters determine when raw materials are deducted from stock in the production process. These parameters also determine what information is reported in other areas in Microsoft Dynamics AX regarding the execution and completion of production orders in manufacturing execution.

1.  Click **Production control** \> **Setup** \> **Manufacturing execution** \> **Production parameters**.

2.  In the **Production parameters** form, in the **General** area, in the **Parameter usage** field, select whether to use company parameters or site parameters.

3.  In the **Bundle type** field, select the allocation key to use if workers make registrations on more than one job at a time.
    
    For more information about how to create allocation keys for a specific site, production unit, or resource, see “Set up allocation keys for bundling jobs,” later in this topic.

4.  Select the **Post time automatically** check box if you want the system to post all journals when registrations are approved and transferred.

5.  In the **Time journal** field, select a journal type. The journal type that you select depends on the option that is selected in the **Job level** field in the **Operations** area of this form:
    
      - If **Route** is selected, select the route journal in the **Time journal** field.
    
      - If **Job** is selected, select the job journal in the **Time journal** field.
    
    **Route** and **Job** refer to scheduling methods that are used in production planning. For more information, see [About working with routes in production](about-working-with-routes-in-production.md) and [About job scheduling](about-job-scheduling.md).
    

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > <P>If you change the setting in the <STRONG>Job level</STRONG> field in the <STRONG>Operations</STRONG> area, you must update the <STRONG>Time journal</STRONG> field to reflect the change. You must also synchronize the job table. For more information, see <A href="synchronize-the-job-table.md">Synchronize the job table</A>.</P>



6.  If the production workers are paid based on piecework, select the relevant pay rate formula in the **Piecework rate formula** field.

7.  If you want to specify piecework orders separately, select the **Specify production order** check box. If you clear this check box, all production orders are handled as piecework orders, and the pay rate that is defined in the **Piecework rate formula** field is used.

8.  Select the **Cost category** check box if you want to use cost categories to calculate costs on production orders or projects. If you clear this check box, real cost is applied.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Real cost can be used only if you use the payroll functionality in <STRONG>Time and attendance</STRONG>. In that case, production costs are calculated based on time registrations and the hourly cost setup for the workers.</P>



9.  In the **Dimension** field, select whether you want to use the financial dimensions that are connected to a job or to a worker. In Microsoft Dynamics AX, financial dimensions are used to associate data or registrations with specific work areas or locations, such as departments, production areas, jobs, or workers.
    
    The options **Job -\> worker** and **Worker -\> job** indicate a first and second option. If no dimensions exist for the first option, the dimensions for the second option are used.

## Set up production parameters – Start parameters

1.  Click **Production control** \> **Setup** \> **Manufacturing execution** \> **Production parameters**.

2.  In the **Production parameters** form, in the **Start** area, in the **Update start on-line** field, select the information to report to the **Production control** module when you start a production job or operation.
    
    The selection in this field determines what information a machine operator must enter in the system. Select from the following options:
    
      - **No** – A machine operator does not start operations and jobs. If you select this option, production orders are initiated at a higher level, such as by a production manager. Also, if this option is selected, no jobs are displayed in the **Job registration** form.
    
      - **Status + quantity** – A machine operator starts operations and jobs by using the **Job registration** form. If this option is selected, the operator must indicate the number of items to be produced when an operation or job is started.
    
      - **Status** – Operation and jobs are started by an operator in the **Job registration** form. If this option is selected, an operator can enter both the quantity and the status, but only the status is reported in the system.
        

        > [!NOTE]
        > <P>You must also set a similar parameter in the <STRONG>Report as finished</STRONG> area of the form, in the <STRONG>Update finished report on-line</STRONG> field. Both selections determine when you update the quantity on production orders. Also, the selections in the <STRONG>Automatic BOM consumption</STRONG> fields are related to reporting and updating production feedback. For more information, see <A href="about-production-parameters-in-manufacturing-execution.md">About production parameters in Manufacturing execution</A>.</P>



3.  Select the **Use Manufacturing Execution parameters** check box if you want to use the production parameter setup in manufacturing execution. If you clear this check box, the parameter settings in the **Production control** module are used.

4.  Select the **Open picking list journals** check box if you want to be able to change the picking list before you post it.

5.  Select the **Start production** check box to update the started quantity on a production order.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>This field is available only if <STRONG>Status + quantity</STRONG> is selected in the <STRONG>Update start on-line</STRONG> field in this area.</P>



6.  Select the **References** check box if you want to automatically start production orders that are attached to the selected production order. If this check box is selected, all related orders start at the same time.

7.  In the **Route card** field, select the route card journal to use for posting time and quantity registrations.

8.  In the **Automatic route consumption** field, select whether the calculated route consumption should be added to the route card journal. Select from the following options:
    
      - **Never** – Do not add the calculated route consumption to the route card journal.
    
      - **Always** – Always add the calculated route consumption to the route card journal.
    
      - **Route group dependent** – Select this option if the settings on the route group determine whether calculated route consumption should be added to the route card journal.

9.  Select the **Post route card now** check box if you want the route card journal to be posted when you start an operation or a job.

10. Select the **End-mark route** check box if you want to automatically post an end marking of the operations and jobs in the route card journal when you start a production.

11. In the **Picking list** field, select the picking list journal to use for posting item consumption.

12.  In the **Automatic BOM consumption** field, select how raw materials are deducted from stock. This parameter must also be set in the **Operations** and **Report as finished** areas of this form.    

> [!IMPORTANT]
> <p>It is important to select the correct combination of parameters to avoid registering erroneous BOM consumption. For example, by selecting the correct combination, you avoid deducting materials two times from stock or not deducting them at all. For information about how different parameter combinations affect item consumption and inventory management, see <A href="about-production-parameters-in-manufacturing-execution.md">About production parameters in Manufacturing execution</A>.</P>

13. Select the **Post picking list now** check box if you want to post automatically generated picking lists immediately.

14. Select the **End-mark picking list** check box to create a picking list that contains end marking lines for the production order. If this check box is selected, no additional item consumption will be posted on the production order.    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <p>This parameter must also be set in the <STRONG>Report as finished</STRONG> area of this form. The BOM consumption method that is selected in each area determines whether the system end-marks a picking list when you start a production order or when you report it as finished.</P>

15. Select the **Physical reduction** check box to allow for reduction of items from stock down to what is actually available.    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>This field and the <STRONG>Pick negative</STRONG> field are mutually exclusive. If you select one check box, you must clear the other.</P>

16. Select the **Pick negative** check box if you want to allow for negative item consumption. If this check box is selected, items that are not yet registered in Microsoft Dynamics AX can be picked from stock.    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>To use this option, the <STRONG>Physical negative inventory</STRONG> check box must be selected for the item model group. For more information, see <A href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa577092(v=ax.60)">Item model groups (form)</A>.</P>


17. Select the **Complete picking list journal** check box if you want to update the status of all BOM items to **Finished picking**. This includes items that consumption has not been calculated for.

18. In the **Create journal per** field, select how picking lists are created. Select from the following options:
    
      - **\[Blank\]** – Create one journal for the production order.

## Set up production parameters – Report as finished parameters

1.  Click **Production control** \> **Setup** \> **Manufacturing execution** \> **Production parameters**.

2.  In the **Production parameters** form, in the **Report as finished** area, in the **Update finished report on-line** field, select the information that you want to report to the **Production control** module when a production job or operation is completed. The selection in this field determines what information a machine operator must report in the system about production feedback. An operator reports the information by using the **Job registration** form.
    
      - **No** – Operations and jobs are not reported as finished by an operator. This means that finished production orders are reported at a higher level, such as by a production manager.
    
      - **Status + quantity** – An operator reports operations and jobs as finished. If this option is selected, the operator must indicate the number of items that were produced when an operation or job is completed. The operator must also update the status of the job.
    
      - **Status** – An operator should update the status of a job or operation when he or she sets it to complete. If this option is selected, the operator can enter both the quantity produced and the status, but only the status is reported in the system.
    
      - **Quantity** – An operator should provide feedback only about the quantity produced. If this option is selected, the operator can enter both the quantity and the status, but only the quantity is reported in the system.
    

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > <P>The option that you select in this field is related to the option that is selected in the <STRONG>Update start on-line</STRONG> field in the <STRONG>Start</STRONG> area of the form. Additionally, the selections in the <STRONG>Automatic BOM consumption</STRONG> fields are related to reporting and updating production feedback. For information about how different settings affect item consumption and reporting feedback on production orders, see <A href="about-production-parameters-in-manufacturing-execution.md">About production parameters in Manufacturing execution</A>.</P>



3.  Select the **Use Manufacturing Execution parameters** check box if you want to use the production parameters that are set up in the **Manufacturing execution parameters** form. If you clear this check box, the parameter settings in the **Production control** module are used.

4.  In the **Route card** field, select the route card journal to use for posting time and quantity registrations when reporting feedback and completing an operation or job.

5.  In the **Automatic route consumption** field, specify whether the calculated route consumption is added to the route card journal when the operation or job is reported as finished:
    
      - **Never** – Do not add the calculated route consumption to the route card journal. If necessary, route consumption can be manually recorded in a route card journal or a job card journal.
    
      - **Always** – Always add the calculated route consumption to the route card journal.
    
      - **Route group dependent** – Select this option if the settings on the route group determine whether calculated route group consumption should be added to the route card journal. For more information, see [Route groups (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa596433\(v=ax.60\)). If automatic consumption of setup time and process time, and automatic reporting of the finished quantity are selected for the attached route group, a route consumption journal is generated.

6.  Select the **End-mark route** check box if you want to automatically post an end marking of operations and jobs in the route card journal when you report a production order as finished.

7.  In the **Picking list** field, select the picking list journal to use for posting item consumption.

8.  In the **Automatic BOM consumption** field, select how raw materials are deducted from stock. This parameter must also be set in the **Start** and **Operations** areas of this form.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>It is important to select the correct combination of parameters to avoid registering erroneous BOM consumption. For example, by selecting the correct combination, you avoid deducting materials two times from stock or not deducting them at all.

9.  Select the **End-mark picking list** check box to create a picking list that contains end marking lines for the production order. If this check box is selected, no additional item consumption will be posted on the production order.

10. In the **Report as finished** field, select the journal to use for posting report as finished information.

11. Select the **End job** check box if you want the production order status to automatically change to **Report as finished** when the last operation or job for the production order is completed. This deletes excess inventory transactions that have a status of **On order** or **Ordered**. The status of the production order changes to **Reported as finished**, and you cannot estimate costs for, schedule, release, or start the production order.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If you clear this check box, a worker must report the production as finished. This procedure is required even if the production is reported as finished when feedback is reported. For more information, see <A href="report-production-orders-as-finished.md">Report production orders as finished</A>.</P>



12. Select the **Accept error** check box if you do not want to receive an error log if inconsistencies occur in the production process, such as inconsistencies in the number of items produced or in the raw materials that are delivered for production. Clear the check box to receive an error log. The following issues are validated in the error log:
    
      - The quantity that is reported as finished is less than or equal to the quantity that was started on the production order.
    
      - All operations in the production route have been reported as finished.
    
      - All estimated materials have been delivered.
    
      - The quantity that is reported as finished for the production order equals the quantity that is reported as finished for the last operation in the route.

## Set up allocation keys for bundling jobs

Allocation keys are used if a worker works on several production jobs at the same time during a work day. This is referred to as job bundling. The total time that is used on a bundle of jobs must be divided among the jobs according to an allocation key. Allocation keys can be set up for a site, a production unit, or a resource.

To learn more about the different allocation keys, and to view examples of how to use allocation keys to calculate time, see [About allocation keys](about-allocation-keys.md).

1.  Click **Production control** \> **Setup** \> **Production** \> **Allocation keys**.

2.  In the **Allocation keys** form, click **New** to create a new allocation key.

3.  In the grid, select a site, a production unit, or a resource.

4.  In the **Bundle type** field, select the allocation key that you want to use.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In the <STRONG>Production parameters</STRONG> form, in the <STRONG>General</STRONG> area, in the <STRONG>Bundle type</STRONG> field, you can select the allocation key to use by default when allocation keys are not specified.</P>
