# Deprecated: (IND) Tax adjustment for Direct Tax (TDS/TCS) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, the tax adjustment functionality lets users select specific transactions and change the Tax Deducted at Source (TDS)/Tax Collected at Source (TCS) group that is applied on the original transaction.

<td><p>Reason for deprecation</p></td>
<td><p>Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 supports subledger journal and source documents, and therefore streamlines the process for posting financial entries to <strong>General ledger</strong>. The existing functionality for withholding tax adjustments is a country-specific feature for India. This functionality was deprecated and was replaced by a more flexible journal-based adjustment of withholding tax through the <strong>Create withholding tax journal</strong> in <strong>General ledger</strong>.</p></td>

<td><p>Replaced by another feature</p></td>
<td><p>Yes. Users can still adjust the posted TDS/TCS by using either of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Adjust tax liability general ledger accounts by using the <strong>Create withholding tax journal</strong> in General ledger to pass adjustment entries.*</p></li>
<li><p>Adjust the original source document by using, for example, a credit note.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>*This method does not affect the original source document or the distribution entries. This method only adjusts the tax in the TDS/TCS Payable/Recoverable accounts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Users can use the adjustment journal functionality to adjust the posted TDS/TCS amount that is not yet reported to the tax department. The amount can be adjusted either up or down.</p></li>
<li><p>Users can also link the adjustment entry for the TDS/TCS with the appropriate parent transaction. In this case, the reports net off the overall result to reflect the change in tax liability that corresponds to the specific document.</p></li>
