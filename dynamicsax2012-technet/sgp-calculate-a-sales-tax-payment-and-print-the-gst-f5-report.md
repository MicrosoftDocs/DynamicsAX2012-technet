You can print a Goods and Services Tax (GST) sales tax return report for Singapore that includes all of the taxable transactions for a specific quarter, grouped by sales tax groups. Send the report to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) on a quarterly basis.

Use the **Sales tax payment** form to calculate a sales tax payment and print the GST F5 report.

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Periodic** \> **Sales tax payments** \> **Sales tax payments**.

2.  In the **Settlement period** field, select a sales tax settlement period that is set up for the IRAS tax authority.

3.  In the **From date** field, select the earliest date to include transaction sales tax amounts in the calculation. For example, to make a sales tax payment for the quarter beginning January 1, enter January 1.

4.  In the **Transaction date** field, select the last day of the period that you are calculating taxes for. For example, enter March 31.

5.  To create a vendor transaction for the sales tax authority assigned to the sales tax settlement period, select the **Update** check box.

6.  Click **OK**. The sales tax payment is calculated, and the GST F5 Goods and Services Tax Return report is printed.
