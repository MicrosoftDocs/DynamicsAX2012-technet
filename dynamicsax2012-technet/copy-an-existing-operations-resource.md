# Copy an existing operations resource 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When you create operations resources, you can save time by creating a copy of an existing resource and then modifying the copy.

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Common** \> **Resources** \> **Resources**.

2.  In the left pane of the **Resources** form, select the resource that you want to copy.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Resource** tab, click **Copy resource**.

4.  In the **Copy resource** dialog box, select a resource and a resource type to copy from and a resource and a resource type to copy to.

5.  Click **OK** to create a copy of the selected resource.

All the field values of the selected resource are copied to the new resource. You can edit the values in the copy as necessary.


> [!TIP]
> <P>When you create many new resources, you can create one original resource and copy it as many times as you require. Then you can use the <STRONG>Bulk edit</STRONG> form to modify values of many resources at the same time.</P>
