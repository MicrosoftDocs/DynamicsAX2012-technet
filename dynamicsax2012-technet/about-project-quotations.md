# About project quotations 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In a project quotation, you enter the services, basic contact information, special trade agreements and discounts, and possible taxes and surcharges that you estimate for a project. In Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can also select the activities or tasks for a project, and create a hierarchy of tasks and subtasks. For each activity, you can enter details about the timing and duration of the activity, and about the skills and experience that are required for workers who perform the activity. For more information about how to create a hierarchy of activities, see [Work breakdown structure (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh209089\(v=ax.60\)).

If the customer approves the project quotation, you can copy the information in the project quotation to a project. You can also choose to copy the project quotation information to a project forecast at the same time. For more information, see [Create a project from a quotation by using the Transfer to Project wizard](create-a-project-from-a-quotation-by-using-the-transfer-to-project-wizard.md).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The project quotation is a non-binding estimate of the work to be performed. However, when the information in the quotation is copied to a project, and the project is associated with a project contract, it becomes part of a binding agreement between two parties. For more information about project contracts, see <A href="about-project-contracts.md">About project contracts</A>.</P>
