# Inventory close [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The Microsoft Dynamics AX inventory close process settles issue transactions to receipt transactions based on the inventory valuation method that is selected in the item’s item model group.

You can also decide to have the general ledger updated to reflect the adjustments that have been made. These tasks include making on-hand inventory and inventory transaction adjustments, and running inventory recalculation and inventory close.

The ledger accounts that are affected by these tasks are those linked to the original inventory transaction.
