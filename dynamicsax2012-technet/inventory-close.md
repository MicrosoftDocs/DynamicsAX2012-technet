# Inventory close 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The Microsoft Dynamics AX inventory close process settles issue transactions to receipt transactions based on the inventory valuation method that is selected in the itemâ€™s item model group.

You can also decide to have the general ledger updated to reflect the adjustments that have been made. These tasks include making on-hand inventory and inventory transaction adjustments, and running inventory recalculation and inventory close.

The ledger accounts that are affected by these tasks are those linked to the original inventory transaction.
