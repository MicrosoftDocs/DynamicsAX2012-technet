# (CZE) Create a customer advance invoice 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

An advance invoice is a document that you can create for a customer. The advance invoice states the amount that must be prepaid on a sales order. Usually, the prepayment must be made before the order is processed. The advance invoice is not an accounting document or a tax document, but is used only as the basis for prepayments. You can create an advance invoice for a free text invoice. You can also reassign an existing advance invoice to a free text invoice, provided that no prepayments are linked to the advance invoice.

## VAT on advance invoices

According to Czech legislation, companies must record value-added tax (VAT) on prepayments from customers, even though the sale has not been completed. You can add a line that contains VAT specifications to an advance invoice, so that you can post VAT from a prepayment. The VAT specifications are taken from sales order lines.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The VAT specifications are copied to the advance invoice lines only if the <STRONG>Type of tax</STRONG> field in the <STRONG>Sales tax codes</STRONG> form is set to <STRONG>Standard VAT</STRONG> or <STRONG>Reduced VAT</STRONG>. If the <STRONG>Type of tax</STRONG> field is set to another value, the line is copied to the advance invoice as if the VAT amount is 0 (zero).</P>
