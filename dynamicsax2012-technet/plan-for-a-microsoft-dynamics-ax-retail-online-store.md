# Plan for a Microsoft Dynamics AX Retail online store 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

The Microsoft Dynamics AX Retail online store is built on the cross-site publishing features of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013. For information about how to plan a Retail online store, see [Plan for cross-site publishing in SharePoint Server 2013](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=282721). As you read these planning materials, know that you do not have to create applications or sites from scratch as discussed in the Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013 planning document. When you deploy the Microsoft Dynamics AX Retail online store, you deploy a *starter* store that includes pre-constructed web applications, sites, and services. You can then configure, customize, and rebrand the starter online store to meet your needs.
