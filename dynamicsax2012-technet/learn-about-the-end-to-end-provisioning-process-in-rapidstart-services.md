# Learn about the end-to-end provisioning process in RapidStart Services 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Beginning October 1, 2015, RapidStart services will no longer be supported. For more information, see the announcement on CustomerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/northamerica/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued or PartnerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/news-events/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued.

Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services lets partners and their customers and prospects configure an installation of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 by using a cloud-based, interview-style questionnaire. The questionnaire uses general terminology about business processes instead of terms that are specific to Microsoft Dynamics AX. Partners can create, maintain, and reuse configurations that reflect their custom solutions. Partners can also create additional question groups and questions to enlarge the scope of a configuration.

As a partner, you start by activating your partner account on the online services for Microsoft Dynamics ERP website, which is a provisioning system that provides access to two portals, Partner Portal and Customer Portal.

  - **Partner Portal** is available to Microsoft Dynamics Certified Partners who have signed the Online Services Addendum (Schedule C) to the Solution Provider Agreement (SPA). Partner Portal lets authorized partners set up and manage various online services for their customers. When you register in Partner Portal, you can subscribe to all the online services that are offered, not just RapidStart Services.

  - **Customer Portal** is a password-protected site for customer users of online services. Customer Portal is included as a benefit of a Microsoft Dynamics ERP service plan and provides customers with the following capabilities:
    
      - Manage the online services for which you signed up.
    
      - Manage online users and user roles.
    
      - Set user and organizational preferences.

The provisioning process can be summarized as follows:

  - A representative of the partner organization activates the organizationâ€™s account on the online services website.

  - The partner signs in to online services and accesses Partner Portal.

  - The partner activates subscriptions for the customer or prospect. As part of the process, an activation email message is sent to the person who is designated as the Customer administrator.

  - The Customer administrator clicks a link in the activation email message to activate RapidStart Services in Customer Portal.

  - The Customer administrator signs in to Customer Portal and starts to use RapidStart Services.
