# (ESP) About equivalences between existing and new chart of accounts 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In accordance with regulations that took effect in 2008, all Spanish legal entities were required to reorganize their existing chart of accounts and maintain multiple charts of accounts. Using Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can make the necessary changes to your chart of accounts and create new charts of accounts.

The reorganized chart of accounts contains the ledger accounts that belonged to the former accounts and the accounts in use. For a particular ledger account, you can verify the equivalency between the former and the new accounts by using the **Related accounts** form that is available from the **Chart of accounts**form. You can view details such as the related account number of the selected ledger account, the chart of accounts in which the related account is available, the percentage allocated to the account for adjustment entries, and whether the account is a preferred account. For more information, see [(ESP) Related Accounts (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh242797\(v=ax.60\)).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The Related accounts form is available only if you have upgraded to a newer version of Microsoft Dynamics AX and have created and used related accounts in the earlier version.</P>
