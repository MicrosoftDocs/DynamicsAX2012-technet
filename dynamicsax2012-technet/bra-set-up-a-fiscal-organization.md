# (BRA) Set up a fiscal organization 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

This topic describes how to set up a fiscal organization, which is a group of fiscal establishments that belong to different fiscal entities but that have the same root fiscal establishment.

The SPED EFD - Contributions statement is centralized by the root fiscal establishment. All fiscal establishments are created in the **Fiscal establishments** form. Use the **Fiscal organization** form to select a root fiscal establishment, and then group fiscal establishments that belong to different fiscal entities but that have the same root fiscal establishment. You can add more fiscal establishments to the **Fiscal establishments** form if the first nine digits of the CNPJ/CPF number of the root fiscal establishment are the same for the fiscal establishments that are created in the **Fiscal establishments** form.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The procedure for completing this task has changed for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3. For information that is specific to Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, see the section later in this topic.</P>
