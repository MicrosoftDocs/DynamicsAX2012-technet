# Attach a project to an estimate 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

An Estimate project is used as a container to group together various control parameters that are used for the estimation process. By attaching a project to an Estimate project, you can track the projectâ€™s WIP and manage revenue recognition.

> <P>This procedure does not apply if Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 is installed.</P>



1.  Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Common** \> **Projects** \> **Estimate projects**.

2.  Select the Estimate project to attach a project to.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Estimate project** tab, in the **Maintain** group, click **Edit**.

4.  In the **Estimate projects** form, on the **Projects** FastTab, select the project to attach to the Estimate project, and then click the left arrow (**\<**).
