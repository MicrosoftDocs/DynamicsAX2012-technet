# Create an XML payment file for customers 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The electronic payment files that you can create for customers can have many XML-based formats. Starting in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, electronic payments can be made by using Application Integration Framework (AIF) services. Several default payment formats are available, such as Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) Direct Debit. A developer can easily create new payment formats if new formats are required.

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Journals** \> **Payments** \> **Payment journal**.

2.  Select a journal, and then click **Lines**.

3.  Click **Functions** \> **Generate payments**. The **Generate payments** form is displayed.

4.  Select the **Export payment using service** option, and then, in the **Payment format** field, select a payment format.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>For example, for SEPA customer payments, select the <STRONG>SEPADirectDebit</STRONG> payment format.</P>



5.  Click **Dialog**.

6.  In the **Payment processing data** form, enter the information that is required for the payment format.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The fields that are displayed in the <STRONG>Payment processing data</STRONG> form depend on the payment format that you selected.</P>



7.  Click **OK**.

8.  In the **Generate payments** form, click **OK**.
