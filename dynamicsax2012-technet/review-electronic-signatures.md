At times you may need to verify electronic signatures, either for your own purposes or to provide information in an audit. To verify electronic signature information, use the following procedure.

1.  Click **System administration** \> **Inquiries** \> **Database** \> **Database log**.

2.  Select a signed record and click **Signature review**.
    
    Information about the document is displayed, including the ID of the signer, the date and time that the document was signed, and the changes that were made to the document.
    
    If the **Verified** check box is selected, the certificate and private key have been verified by the system and there is no evidence of tampering.

3.  To print the information, click the Print icon.
