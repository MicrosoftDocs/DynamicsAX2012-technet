# Entity overview pages 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Entity overview pages display various types of information about a single record, such as the record for a customer or an order. You can use these pages to view an overview of information that is related to the record.

Depending on the type of record, the entity overview pages may include an Action Pane that you can use to complete tasks for the record. You can also use the Action Pane to view related information, and create or modify the record.

The page may also include other elements, such as lists, FastTabs, an Infolog, or a workflow message bar. For more information, see [Common page elements](common-page-elements.md).
