# (BEL) Create a customer account with an enterprise number 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The enterprise number is a unique identification code assigned by the Belgian government to each Belgian company to replace the nine-digit VAT number. The enterprise number, which must appear in customer account records, contains text and a ten-digit number. The abbreviations TVA or BTW in the text of the customerâ€™s unique enterprise number indicate that the company is required to pay VAT. If the company has an Intrastat obligation, the abbreviation BE is also included in the text.

The enterprise number is used to generate the EU sales list and Annual sales list and to declare VAT when you post an invoice for a customer.

Use this procedure to create a customer account and specify the enterprise number assigned to the customer by the Belgian government.
