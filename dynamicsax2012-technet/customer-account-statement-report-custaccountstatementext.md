# Customer account statement report (CustAccountStatementExt) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The **Customer account statement** report displays external customer account statements that you can send to your customers.

The currency and language for the customer are used on the external account statement. This differs from the internal customer account statement, which always displays amounts in the accounting currency for the legal entity. If the account statement includes transactions for more than one currency, the opening balance and the closing balance are displayed in each currency.

To improve performance when you run statements for many customers at the same time, use one or more of the following options:

  - Use batch processing. By moving the processing to a server, report performance can improve.

  - Use parallel processing. By dividing this process into multiple tasks, report performance can improve. Because multiple tasks are running at the same time, the reports might be printed in a different order than the order that was specified.

  - Apply range restrictions to limit the number of records in each batch. Performance can be improved by submitting multiple smaller batches to be processed at the same time on different servers, instead of submitting one large batch.

  - You can select the **Only open** check box to include only open transactions, instead of all transactions, for each customer.

  - You can select the **Balance other than zero** check box to avoid printing statements for customers who have a balance of 0.00.

If your organization uses centralized statements, which means sending customer statements from one legal entity on behalf of other legal entities in your organization, make sure that you are using the legal entity of the statement before you print statements. Information about a customer's account activity in other legal entities is included on the statement, if the legal entities use the same party ID for that customer account. The transactions for each legal entity will be grouped together on the statement.

The statement address that is specified for the customer account is included on the statement. If a statement address is not specified, the primary address for the customer account is used.
