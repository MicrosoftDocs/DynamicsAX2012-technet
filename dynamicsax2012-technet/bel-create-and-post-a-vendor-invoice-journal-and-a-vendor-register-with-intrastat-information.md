# (BEL) Create and post a vendor invoice journal and a vendor register with Intrastat information 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The Intrastat declaration is a mandatory statement that reports the movement of goods between the European Union (EU) member states. Belgian companies can use the **Intrastat** form to generate an Intrastat declaration in CSV format for submittal to the Belgian customs authority. Before you can create and post a vendor invoice journal or vendor register and submit an Intrastat declaration, you must set up Value Added Tax (VAT) and Intrastat information for the vendor.

Before you generate an Intrastat declaration, complete the following:

  - Set up Intrastat parameters to generate Intrastat transaction details and compression details. For more information, see [About Intrastat](about-intrastat.md) and [Intrastat (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa619055\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Create an item and specify the **Commodity**, **Additional units**, and **Net weight** fields for the Intrastat transaction. For more information, see [Commodity codes (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa617816\(v=ax.60\)) and [Units (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh209233\(v=ax.60\)).

5.  In the **Transport** and **Port** fields, specify the means of transport and the port where the delivery is to be loaded.
