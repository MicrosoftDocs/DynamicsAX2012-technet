# (RUS) Set up competency information for workers and employees 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can hire a worker in a legal entity, and then assign the worker to a single position or multiple positions. When you assign the worker to a position, an employee identification code is assigned to the worker for the position. For example, you hire a worker W1, and then assign the worker to three positions, such as P1, P2, and P3. Three employee identification codes are assigned to the worker, such as E1, E2, and E3.

You can set up the following competency information for workers and employees:

  - Education codes, degree codes, and language codes that are used to record the competency information for workers.

  - Evaluation result codes, violation codes, and privilege codes that are used to record the competency information for employees based on their positions.

When you create a worker record in the Human resources module, and then hire the worker as an employee in the Payroll (Russia) module, you can copy the skill related information of the worker that is defined in the Human resources module to the Payroll (Russia) module. For more information, see [Competency - Skills (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa616428\(v=ax.60\)).

Follow the steps in this topic to set up competency information for workers and employees in the Payroll (Russia) module.
