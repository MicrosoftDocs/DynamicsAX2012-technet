## Mark invoice lines for settlement

When you process a customer payment, you can use the **Mark invoice lines** form to review the TDS and TCS amounts for individual transaction lines, and then select the lines for settlement. The amount to settle value for an invoice line is based on the following calculations:

**Amount to settle** = **Line amount** - **TDS**

–or–

**Amount to settle** = **Line amount** + **TCS**
