# Deprecated: Sales shipment 


For the next major release after Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, the sales shipment feature will be deprecated.

Microsoft Dynamics AX customers use the sales shipment feature to create a collection of items that are packed in the same container for transport by, for example, ship, rail, truck, or plane. A shipment includes either the order, part of an order, or a consolidation of multiple orders. Based on the contents of the shipment, one or more picking routes, one or more pallet transports, or both are created.
