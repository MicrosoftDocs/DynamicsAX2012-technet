# Set up Enterprise Portal Search 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Enterprise Portal search is provided by a product-wide feature of Microsoft Dynamics AX that is named Enterprise Search. Enterprise Search lets users search through data, metadata, and documents that are attached to records. Users can search for common nouns, such as 'customer' and 'cash flow report.' Users can also search for specific data, such as a customer name, product ID, or telephone number.

All aspects of crawling, indexing, and retrieving Microsoft Dynamics AX data and metadata for Search are performed by one of the following products:

  - Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 or Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010

  - Microsoft Search Server 2010 or Microsoft Search Server Express 2010

  - Microsoft FAST Search Server 2010

  - Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2013 or Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013

One of these products must be available in the computing environment before you can install Enterprise Search. For more information about Enterprise Search, see [Enterprise Search](enterprise-search.md).

Before users can perform searches from Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX or from the Microsoft Dynamics AX client, you must deploy Search. For more information, see [Install Microsoft Dynamics AX Enterprise Search](install-microsoft-dynamics-ax-enterprise-search.md).
