# Set up registers (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

When you set up a register in Retail POS, you select a hardware profile and a visual profile for the register. A hardware profile determines the physical configuration of a register and a visual profile determines its screen characteristics. This topic explains how to set up registers and assign profiles to them.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Retail essentials, the form that you use to complete this task includes a subset of the controls that are available for other configurations of Retail. If a topic about this form describes controls that you don't see, it may be because youâ€™re using Retail essentials.</P>



You can assign the profiles either to a specific register or to a group of registers. You can also modify the profiles that are assigned to a register. Certain configuration changes do not take effect at stores until the register in the store are restarted. In general, if you modify anything that affects the POS register setup or configuration of one or more registers, you must restart the affected register.
