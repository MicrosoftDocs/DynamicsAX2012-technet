# (IND) Adjust advance payments for TCS authority vendors 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can adjust an advance payment made to the Tax Collected at Source (TCS) authority vendor to an actual payment in the **Vendors** form (Click **Accounts payable** \> **Common** \> **Vendors** \> **All vendors**. On the **All vendors** list page, on the **Action Pane**, click **Vendor** to create a new vendor, or select a vendor in the list.).

If the actual payment made is more than the advance payment, two challan numbers are generated for the transaction. However, only the first challan number is displayed in the TCS inquiry.
