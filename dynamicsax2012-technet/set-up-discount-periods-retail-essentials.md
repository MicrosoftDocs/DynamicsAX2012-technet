# Set up discount periods (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to set up discount periods. A discount period defines the period during which a price adjustment or discount is valid. For example, if multiple discounts are in effect during a particular period, you can assign one discount period to all the discounts.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Retail essentials, the form that you use to complete this task includes a subset of the controls that are available for other configurations of Retail. If a topic about this form describes controls that you don't see, it may be because you’re using Retail essentials.</P>



1.  Click **Retail essentials** \> **Merchandising** \> **Setup** \> **Price and discount setup** \> **Discount periods**.

2.  Press CTRL+N or click **New** to create a new discount period.

3.  In the **Discount period number** field, type a unique ID number or name, and then, in the **Description** field, type a brief description.
