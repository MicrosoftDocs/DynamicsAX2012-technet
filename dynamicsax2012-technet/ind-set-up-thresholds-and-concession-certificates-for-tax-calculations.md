# (IND) Set up thresholds and concession certificates for tax calculations 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

After you create the threshold definitions and set up threshold hierarchies, you can set up thresholds and concession certificates for direct tax calculations. Microsoft Dynamics AX calculates direct taxes on transactions based on the threshold segments that you specify. Follow the steps in this topic to set up thresholds and concession certificates for direct tax calculation.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic does not apply to versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 prior to cumulative update 7 for AX 2012 R2.</P>



## This task is part of a bigger process

The following illustration shows how setting up thresholds and concession certificates for direct tax calculation relates to threshold limits task.

For an overview of the process, see [(IND) Tax thresholds and tax concession certificates](ind-tax-thresholds-and-tax-concession-certificates.md).

## Assign thresholds and threshold values to a withholding tax code

Use the **Withholding tax codes** form to set up a withholding tax code to use threshold limits. Use the **Threshold references** form to set up an entity to use a threshold, and then use the **Threshold designer** form to define the tax rates that apply to the final levels of the various hierarchy segments of the threshold.

To assign threshold and threshold values to a withholding tax code, follow these steps:

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **Withholding tax** \> **Withholding tax codes**.

2.  Select a withholding tax code that has a **TDS** or **TCS** tax type for which to apply the threshold.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If you specified values in the <STRONG>Value</STRONG> field in the <STRONG>Withholding tax values</STRONG> form for the withholding tax code, remove the values.</P>



3.  Select the **Apply threshold** check box to apply threshold for the tax code.

4.  Click **Threshold references** to open the **Threshold references** form, where you can set up an entity to use a threshold by specifying the account type, account code, and threshold definition.

8.  Repeat step 7 to set up additional values for the same threshold segment.

9.  Repeat steps 6 and 7 to set up values for additional threshold segments.

10. Repeat steps 4 through 7 to set up additional entities to use the threshold.

You can click **Referenced by** to open the **Threshold reference list** form, where you can view the list of referencing entities that use the selected threshold.

## If required: Set up a tax concession certificate for a customer or vendor

If a customer or a vendor has a concession certificate, you can use the **Withholding tax concessions** form to set up the details of the tax concession certificate for the customer or vendor in Microsoft Dynamics AX. You can set up a tax concession certificate for a vendor only if you have set up the PAN status for the vendor as **Received** in the **Status** field on the **Tax information** FastTab in the **Vendors** form.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you change the PAN status for a vendor from <STRONG>Received</STRONG> to <STRONG>Not available</STRONG> in the <STRONG>Status</STRONG> field on the <STRONG>Tax information</STRONG> FastTab in the <STRONG>Vendors</STRONG> form, the tax concession certificate that is available for the vendor will be deleted.</P>



To set up a tax concession certificate for a customer or vendor, follow these steps:

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **Withholding tax** \> **Withholding tax codes**.

2.  Select a withholding tax code that has a **TDS** or **TCS** tax type for which threshold is applied.

3.  Click **Threshold references** to open the **Threshold references** form, and then select the threshold reference to set up the concession certificate for.

4.  Click **Threshold designer** to open the **Threshold designer** form, and then select a final level of a threshold segment to set up the concession certificate for.

5.  Click **Concession certificate** to open the **Withholding tax concessions** form.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The <STRONG>Concession certificate</STRONG> button is available only if you set up a customer or vendor account to use the threshold by specifying <STRONG>Customer</STRONG> or <STRONG>Vendor</STRONG> in the <STRONG>Account type</STRONG> field, <STRONG>Table</STRONG> in the <STRONG>Account code</STRONG> field, and a customer or vendor account in the <STRONG>Account or group</STRONG> field in the <STRONG>Threshold references</STRONG> form.</P>



6.  In the **Certificate number** field, enter the number of the tax concession certificate that is received from the customer or vendor.

7.  In the **From date** and **To date** fields, specify the first and the last dates of the validity of the certificate.

8.  In the **Effective cancellation date** field, enter the date after which the certificate will no longer be used or will be canceled.

9.  In the **Turnover threshold** field, enter the maximum turnover amount up to which the certificate is applicable.

10. Click **OK**.

11. Repeat steps 4 through 10 to set up tax concession certificates for other segments, if required.

## Next step

You have finished setting up tax thresholds and tax concession certificates for India. To set up withholding tax groups, and to create and post transactions that use thresholds, perform the following tasks:

1.  Set up a withholding tax group that contains the withholding tax codes to which you assigned thresholds and threshold values. For more information about how to set up a withholding tax group, see [(IND) Withholding tax groups (modified form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj677874\(v=ax.60\)).

2.  Create and post transactions that use the withholding tax group for the withholding tax codes to which you assigned thresholds and threshold values. For more information about how to create and post transactions, see [Calculate and post withholding tax](calculate-and-post-withholding-tax.md) and [Enter a vendor payment that is subject to withholding tax](enter-a-vendor-payment-that-is-subject-to-withholding-tax.md).
