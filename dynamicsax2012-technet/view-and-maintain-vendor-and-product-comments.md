# View and maintain vendor and product comments 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can allow employees to enter ratings or comments for items or services that they have ordered, or for a vendor from whom they have ordered items or services. Those ratings and comments are displayed on the **Order products** site in Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX.

You can configure settings in Microsoft Dynamics AX so that the ratings and comments are automatically displayed on the **Order products** site. Alternatively, you can configure the settings so that each comment must be reviewed and approved before it is displayed.

Use this procedure to review comments that employees enter for products and vendors, and to approve or reject the comments.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You cannot modify a rating or comment that an employee entered. You can only approve or reject it.</P>



## Review comments and ratings for a product or vendor

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Common** \> **Catalogs** \> **Catalog comments**.

2.  In the **Manage comments** form, select a comment that has a status of **Pending review**. You can sort the comments by status by clicking the **Status** column heading.

3.  Review the comment in the lower pane.

4.  Click **Approve** to approve the comment. The comment will be displayed on the **Order products** site the next time that the site is opened.

5.  Click **Reject** to reject the comment. The comment will not be displayed on the **Order products** site.

6.  To approve a comment that was previously rejected, select the comment, and then click **Approve**. The comment will be displayed on the **Order products** site the next time that the site is opened.

7.  To reject a comment that was previously approved, select the comment, and then click **Reject**. The comment will no longer be displayed on the **Order products** the next time that the site is opened.
