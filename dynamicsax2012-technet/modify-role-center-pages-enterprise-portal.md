# Modify Role center pages (Enterprise Portal) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Role Center pages contain various pieces, or Web parts, that display information. A Web part is a modular unit of information that forms the basic building block of a Web part page. The Web parts on a page are arranged in Web part zones. You can add Web parts to the zones on a page, and then customize the individual parts to create a page that meets your needs. All Web parts share a set of common properties. These properties control each Web part's appearance, such as the title, height, and width, and layout, such as the part's order in a zone and the direction of the content. The properties also control advanced characteristics, such as the image icons and description. For more information about Web parts and pages, see the SharePoint documentation.

## Page views

Depending on your permission level, you can customize the appearance of Web parts and pages.

## Personal view

Many users of Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX can change only their own view of Web parts and pages. If you are one of these users, any changes that you make are visible only to you. To modify your personal view of a page, click **\<User name\>** \> **Personalize this Page**. The page is displayed in edit mode. To modify a Web part's properties, click **Edit My Web Part** in the list in the upper-right corner of the Web part.

## Shared view

Users with additional permission levels can modify the view of Web parts and pages for other users. To modify the shared view of a page, click **Site Actions** \> **Edit Page**. The page is displayed in edit mode. To modify a Web part's properties, click **Edit Web Part** in the list in the upper-right corner of the Web part.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Because most users have access only to the personal view of a page, the information in this Help includes the steps for modifying personal views.</P>
