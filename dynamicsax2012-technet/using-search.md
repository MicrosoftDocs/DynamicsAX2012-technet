# Using search 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use Enterprise Search in Microsoft Dynamics AX to search through data, metadata, documents that are attached to records, and Help topics in the Help Server. You can use common nouns such as 'customer' and 'cash flow report' as the search term. You can also search for specific data, such as a customer name, a product ID, or a telephone number. The search box is prominently displayed in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client, and you can view your recent search terms in the drop-down list.

When you click the search icon, either in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client or Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX, the search results are displayed on a new page. To return to the previous form or page, click the Back button on the menu bar.

If search results do not display the tables or fields that you need, ask your Microsoft Dynamics AX system administrator to configure additional tables and fields so that they are displayed in search results. Also note that if your system administrator configured data partitions, you must be given access to a partition to review search results in that partition. Ask your system administrator to verify that you have access to the partition that stores the data to which you need access.
