# Configure the workflow notification options 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Notifications may be sent to you when workflow-related events occur. For example, a notification may be sent to you when a document is assigned to you for approval or when the workflow process is completed for a document that you submitted. You can specify how you want to receive workflow notifications.

1.  Click **File** \> **Tools** \> **Options**.

2.  In the left pane of the **Options** form, click **Notifications**.

3.  In the **Receive notifications every (minutes)** field, enter the number of minutes to specify how often you want to receive notifications.

4.  In the **Line-item notification type** list, specify how you want to receive workflow notifications for line items from the following options:
    
      - **Grouped** – Notifications for line items are grouped into a single notification.
    
      - **Individual** – A notification is sent for each line item.

5.  To receive notifications in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client, select the **Show notifications in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client** check box.
    
    If you select the **Show notifications in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client** check box, you can also specify whether you want to receive notifications as pop-up messages. To receive pop-up messages, select the **Show pop-ups for notifications** check box.

6.  To receive notifications as email, select the **Send notifications in email** check box.
