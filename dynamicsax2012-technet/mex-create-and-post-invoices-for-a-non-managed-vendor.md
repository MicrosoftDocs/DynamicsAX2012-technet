# (MEX) Create and post invoices for a non-managed vendor 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use the **Journal voucher** form to enter petty cash or minor expense transactions that are not posted directly to a vendor account, and then post an invoice for a non-managed vendor. To post invoice transactions for non-managed vendors, you must select the account type as **Ledger**, **Project**, or **Bank**. Petty cash or minor expense transactions that include Value Added Tax (VAT) should be declared in the purchase VAT book and in the Declaración Informativa de Operaciones con Terceros (DIOT) report. For more information, see [(MEX) Generate the DIOT declaration report (DIOTDeclaration\_MX)](mex-generate-the-diot-declaration-report-diotdeclaration-mx.md).

For DIOT declaration purposes, you must specify additional information, such as the Registro Federal del Contribuyentes (RFC) number, Clave Única de Registro de Población (CURP) number, vendor name, and the operation type for these vendor invoice transactions. Before you create and post an invoice, you must set up a sales tax code, sales tax group, and item sales tax group for purchase transactions with non-managed vendors. For more information, see [Setting up sales tax groups and item sales tax groups](setting-up-sales-tax-groups-and-item-sales-tax-groups.md).

Use the following procedures to create and post invoices for a non-managed vendor.

## Set up a sales tax code

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **Sales tax** \> **Sales tax codes**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a new sales tax code. For more information, see [Create various kinds of sales tax codes](create-various-kinds-of-sales-tax-codes.md).
