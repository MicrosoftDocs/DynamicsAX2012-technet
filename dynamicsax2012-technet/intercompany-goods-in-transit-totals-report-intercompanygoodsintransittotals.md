# Intercompany goods in transit totals report (InterCompanyGoodsInTransitTotals) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use the **Intercompany goods in transit totals** report to create a general ledger entry for the value of intercompany goods in transit for a specific period. By doing this, it will offset the existing balance for the main account. The report assumes that intercompany goods in transit are always owned by the buyer.

The report displays a period starting balance, a period ending balance, and the net change for a specific period. The balances and net change are printed per item and grouped by vendor. This allows you to manually enter general ledger data directly from the report totals without requiring you to export to Excel or to create Excel aggregations. The report also displays a calculated inventory value, liability, and variance to standard cost.
