# Download sales orders from an online store 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

This topic describes how to download orders that were entered in an online store to generate sales orders in Microsoft Dynamics AX. When customers place orders for products in your online stores, you must complete the following steps to pull the transactions into Microsoft Dynamics AX to process the orders:

1.  Run the distribution schedule P-job to pull transactions from the online store into Microsoft Dynamics AX.

2.  Run the **Synchronize online orders** process to generate sales orders so that the sales orders can be processed and invoiced, and the products can be picked, packed, and shipped to the customer.

You can run these processes manually or you can set them up as a batch process to run automatically on a regular basis. For more information about how to set up batch processes, see [Batch processing overview](batch-processing-overview.md).

Electronic gift cards are processed automatically when the sales order is invoiced. (The <STRONG>Gift card</STRONG> fields are on the <STRONG>Packing</STRONG> tab on the <STRONG>Line details</STRONG> FastTab in the <STRONG>Sales order</STRONG> form.)</P>
