# About setting up a project budget [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Before you start to use budget control for projects, complete the procedures in the following topics. Although you can work through the topics in whatever order is most convenient for you, the order listed here is usually the most efficient.


> [!WARNING]
> <P>The project budget functionality is enabled by the Inventory forecasting configuration key. To ensure that the project budget functionality is working correctly, this configuration must be key enabled.</P>



  - [Configure project budget control](configure-project-budget-control.md) (Optional) – Project budget control is generally configured per project. However, several budget control settings apply to all projects. By asking several questions about your organization, you can use the answers to configure settings that apply to all project budgets.

  - [Create forecast models for project budgets](create-forecast-models-for-project-budgets.md) (Required) – In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, a project budget must be associated with forecast models that are set up specifically for the original and remaining budgets.

  - [Configure project budget overrun settings](configure-project-budget-overrun-settings.md) (Optional) – The default setting for project budgets lets users post a transaction even if the transaction will cause a budget overrun. However, you can choose a more restrictive setting in the **Project management and accounting parameters** form or choose overriding settings for user groups.

After you complete the setup procedures, you can create the budgets for individual projects. For more information, see [Create and submit an original project budget](create-and-submit-an-original-project-budget.md).
