# (RUS) Issue and post a customs cargo declaration for import or export operations 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use the **GTD issue** form to issue a customs cargo declaration (GTD) for import or export operations. You must first create the customs journal lines for a transaction. After a customs cargo declaration is issued, the status of the journal is changed to **Issued**. A new value for the GTD inventory dimension is created in the **Inventory dimensions** form. The inventory transactions that are associated with the customs journal have the GTD value in the inventory dimension. If the GTD number or date is corrected, you can cancel the issue of a GTD by using the **GTD issue cancelling** form. The status of the journal is changed to **In progress** after the GTD issue is canceled.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>When you create a customs journal that is based on an open purchase order, the lines that belong to the purchase order are updated with the GTD that is issued for the related import operations.</P>



The status of a journal is changed to **Posted** after a GTD is posted. The corresponding general ledger, vendor, and tax transactions are created based on the rules for customs payments. A facture of the **GTD** type is created for the import customs journal.

1.  Click **Inventory management** \> **Common** \> **All customs journals**.

2.  Create a customs journal, or double-click an existing customs journal.

3.  On the **Customs journal lines** FastTab, click **Create lines** to open the **Create customs journal lines.** form.

4.  In the upper pane, select the **Choose** check box to mark the purchase order or vendor invoices for the import operations to include in the customs journal.

If **Purchased** is selected in the **Receipt transactions status** field, you can create journal lines for vendor invoices.
