Management Reporter lets you design financial reports based on ledger accounts and financial dimensions, drill down to transaction-level detail, and use web-based report viewing. For more information about how to print financial reports by using Management Reporter, see [Management Reporter for Microsoft Dynamics ERP](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=324762).
