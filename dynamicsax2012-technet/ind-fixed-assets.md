# (IND) Fixed assets 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Fixed assets are items of value, such as buildings, vehicles, land, and equipment, which are owned by an individual or corporation. You can set up and enter acquisition information for fixed asset records, and then manage fixed assets by depreciating them and setting a capitalization threshold to determine depreciation. You can calculate adjustments to the fixed assets, and also dispose of them.

The topics in this section provide information about fixed assets for India.
