Click **Cost accounting** \> **Common** \> **Cost categories**.

To view dimension balances for cost categories in the **Cost categories** form, select a cost category, select either **Primary costs** or **Secondary costs** in the **Cost type** column, and then click **Dimension balance** \> **Cost category**.

To view query dimension balances for service categories in the **Cost categories** form, select a cost category, select **Service category** in the **Cost type** column, and then click **Dimension balance** \> **Service category**.

In the **Dimension balance** form, you can view the dimension balances for the selected period and for two different value types. For each column group, you can select the following value types:

  - **Actual costs**

  - **Budget costs**

  - **Basic plan costs**

  - **Flexible plan costs**

  - **Target costs**


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you select <STRONG>Basic plan costs</STRONG>, <STRONG>Flexible plan costs</STRONG>, or <STRONG>Target costs</STRONG>, you must select a budget model.</P>



The **Total values** section consists of two areas:

  - The total of primary costs, secondary costs, and total costs

  - The dimensions that these costs are posted to

Primary costs are posted to ledger accounts. Secondary costs are generated only in **Cost accounting**.

For the selected dimension, you can display cost, service, and calculation transactions by clicking **Transactions**. To display cost balances, click **Cost balance**.
