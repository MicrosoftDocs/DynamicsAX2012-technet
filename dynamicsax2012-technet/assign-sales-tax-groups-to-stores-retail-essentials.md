# Assign sales tax groups to stores (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to assign a sales tax group to a retail store. Sales tax groups determine the sales tax and duty calculation for customers, vendors, and ledger accounts. You must set up a sales tax group for each store.

1.  Click **Retail essentials** \> **Channels** \> **Retail stores**.

2.  In the **Retail stores** list, select a store to modify, or create a new store. For more information about how to create a new store, see [Set up a retail store](set-up-a-retail-store.md).

3.  In the **Stores** form, on the **General** FastTab, under **Sales tax**, in the **Sales tax group** field, select a sales tax group for the store.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Retail essentials, the form that you use to complete this task includes a subset of the controls that are available for other configurations of Retail. If a topic about this form describes controls that you don't see, it may be because youâ€™re using Retail essentials.</P>
