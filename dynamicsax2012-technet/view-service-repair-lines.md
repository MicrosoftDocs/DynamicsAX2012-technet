Use the **View service repair lines** page to view a list of the service repair lines that have been created for the service objects on service orders. You can then use the **Show repair line** page to view the details of a specific repair line.

1.  Click **Service management** on the top link bar, and then click **Service orders** on the Quick Launch. The **Service orders** page is displayed.

2.  Select the service order, and on the Action Pane click **Repair lines**. The **View service repair lines** form is displayed.

3.  To view details about a repair line, select the line and then click the **Details** button. The **Show repair line** page is displayed, where you can view detailed information about the repair line, such as the technician who will repair the service object.
