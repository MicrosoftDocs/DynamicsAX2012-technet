# Create a purchase inquiry 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

Use this procedure to validate a purchase with the vendor and generate a purchase inquiry before the purchase order is confirmed. For example, you can validate a vendor purchase with regard to product quality or delivery dates.

## Create and print a purchase inquiry

A purchase inquiry lets you print the contents of a purchase order before the purchase order is confirmed.

To create and print a purchase inquiry, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Common** \> **Purchase orders** \> **All purchase orders**.

2.  Select a purchase order.

3.  On the **Navigation Pane**, under **Purchase**, in the **Generate** group, select **Purchase inquiry**.

4.  Select **Print purchase inquiry**, click **Printer setup**, and then click **Purchase inquiry**.

5.  In the **Print destination settings** form, select a print destination, and then click **OK**.

## Define printing options for purchase inquiries

You can print purchase in a report format, so you must define the printing options for the purchase inquiry reports.

To define printing options for purchase inquiries, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Setup** \> **Forms** \> **Form setup**.

3.  Select the format for the report.

4.  Click the **General** link, and then click **Print management**.

5.  Click the **Purchase order purchase inquiry** folder, and then select **Original** or **Copy**. If this is the first time that you print a purchase inquiry, right-click **Purchase order purchase inquiry**, and then select **New**. In the **Original / copy** field, select **Original** or **Copy**.

6.  In the **Report format** field, select **PurchPurchaseOrder.Report**.

## View the approval status of purchase orders and identify orders with a purchase inquiry

When you create a purchase inquiry for a purchase order, the purchase order shows the **In external review** approval status. You can either view the approval status of a single purchase order, or you can use a filter to view a list of purchase orders with a particular status.

To view the approval status of a single purchase order, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Common** \> **Purchase orders** \> **All purchase orders**.

2.  Select a purchase order, and on the **Action Pane**, under **Purchase order**, in the **Maintain** group, click **Edit**.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, in the **Show** group, click the button to open the header view.

4.  On the **General** tab, view the approval status in the **Approval status** field. Purchase orders with a purchase inquiry have the **In external review** approval status.

To view a list of orders with a particular approval status, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Common** \> **Purchase orders** \> **All purchase orders**.

2.  Click Ctrl+G, or click the **Filter By Grid** button.

3.  In the **Approval status** field, type the approval status that you want to filter by. To filter by the **In external review** approval status, type In external review.

## Track version history or compare versions of the purchase inquiry

3.  Select the two purchase order versions that you want to compare, and then click **Compare purchase order versions**.
