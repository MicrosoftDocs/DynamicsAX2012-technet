# Upgrade SSRS reports 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Following metadata upgrade in a layer, you need to upgrade any SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports in that layer. Mark the **Upgrade SSRS reports** task as complete when you have done this. For more information about reports, see [Reporting in Microsoft Dynamics AX](reporting-in-microsoft-dynamics-ax.md) on MSDN.
