# About sites and the multisite functionality 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A site is a grouping of business resources, such as warehouses and production units, which share interrelated transactions, are located at a particular geographic location, and belong to a single legal entity. A single site cannot be shared by multiple legal entities.

The site entity, which is implemented as an inventory storage dimension, plus the enhancements to the existing dimensions framework, provide the structural foundation for the multisite functionality.

## About multisite functionality

A company may establish logistic operations at multiple sites for a variety of reasons. These might include setting up distribution centers that serve different geographic markets, or setting up production facilities at a particular location because of lower overhead costs, proximity to raw materials, or convenient transportation.

Using the multisite functionality, a customer can configure multiple sites to reflect its unique business model and support its operations and process flows. Here are some examples of business environments where customers could set up multiple sites:

  - A single production site that uses a single warehouse

  - A single production site that uses multiple warehouses

  - Multiple production sites that use a shared distribution center

  - Multiple local production sites that use a shared production site

A customer must analyze its business requirements and determine how best to use the multisite functionality to align with its business processes. The multisite functionality can be used in a single-site environment by specifying only one site and the warehouse(s) at that site.
