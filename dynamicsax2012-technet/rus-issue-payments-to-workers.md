## 1\. Create pay-sheets for advance, vacation, interim, aggregate, tax, and payroll types

Use the **Pay-sheets** form to create pay-sheets for employees. You can create pay-sheets for advance, vacation, tax, interim, aggregate, and payroll types.

## Create a pay-sheet for advance payment

You can create an advance pay-sheet to determine the advance payment that is to be made to certain employees in the middle of a payroll period. The calculation procedure for advances must be configured to calculate the amount to be paid in advance. For more information, see [(RUS) Set up calculation procedures for the payroll process](rus-set-up-calculation-procedures-for-the-payroll-process.md).

To create an advance pay-sheet, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Salary payment** \> **Pay-sheets** .

2.  In the **Reporting period** field, select the payroll period.

3.  In the **Payroll type** field, select **Advance** to select advance transactions that are created by the payroll calculation procedure during the specified calculation period. For more information, see "Calculate salaries using calculation procedures" in [(RUS) Generate pay statements](rus-generate-pay-statements.md).

4.  Click **Create** to open the **Generation of pay-sheets** form to create an advance pay-sheet.

5.  In the **Level of detailing of pay sheet** field, select either **By enterprise** to create the pay-sheet for the enterprise or **By departments** to create a pay-sheet for each department.

6.  Click **OK** to open the **Generation of pay-sheets** form, and then specify the criteria to generate the advance pay-sheet.

## Create a vacation pay-sheet

You can create a vacation pay-sheet for employees who have registered for paid vacation. For more information about registering and calculating the vacation payment, see [(RUS) Register and calculate compensation for vacations and business trips](rus-register-and-calculate-compensation-for-vacations-and-business-trips.md). The calculated vacation payments are displayed in the **Vacation pay-sheets** form.
