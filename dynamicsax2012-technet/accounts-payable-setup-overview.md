_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use this topic as your guide to setting up Accounts payable.

## Prerequisites

Set up the following modules:

  - **System administration**

  - **Organization administration**

  - **General ledger**
    
      - If you plan to use payment journals, you must first set up payment journals. (Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **Journals** \> **Journal names**.)
    
      - If you plan to run exchange rate adjustments, you must set up currency codes in the **Currencies** form, exchange rate types in the **Exchange rate types** form, and currency exchange rates in the **Currency exchange rates** form.

  - In **Cash and bank management**, set up bank accounts to use with methods of payment.

## Main setup forms for Accounts payable

Use the following forms to set up the basic functionality of Accounts payable for each legal entity. The forms are listed in the recommended order of setup.

To make the setup process simpler, you can create templates from the first records that are created. A template typically includes entries in many fields that reflect the features that the organization wants to implement for a particular type of vendor.
