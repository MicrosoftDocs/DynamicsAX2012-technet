# Reverse settlements 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use the **Closed transaction editing in several currencies** form to reverse settlements for customers or vendors. You might do this if the wrong date or settlement amount was used. When you reverse a settlement, all transaction distributions that were involved in settling an invoice with a payment are reversed, such as general ledger postings, exchange rate gains or losses, penny differences, and cash discount transactions.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The original invoice and payment transactions are not reversed automatically when you reverse settlements. For information about how to reverse or settle those transactions, see <A href="reverse-a-transaction.md">Reverse a transaction</A> or <A href="settle-transactions-with-payments.md">Settle transactions with payments</A>.</P>
