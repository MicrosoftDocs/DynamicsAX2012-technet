## How to filter the data on this report

When you generate this report, the following default parameters are displayed. You can use these parameters to filter the data that will be displayed on the report. For more information, see [Filter the data on a report](filter-the-data-on-a-report.md).

In the **Customer payment retention summary** field, select how you want to organize the report information. You can create a report by customer, contract, project, or billing rule. The combination of filters that you select determines what is displayed on the report. For example, if you select **Contract**, the customer payment retention totals by project contract are displayed on the report. If there are no customer payment retention amounts that meet the criteria that you select, the report is empty.
