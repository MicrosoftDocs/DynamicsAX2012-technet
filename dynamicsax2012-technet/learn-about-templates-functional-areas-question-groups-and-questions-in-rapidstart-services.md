# Learn about templates, functional areas, question groups, and questions in RapidStart Services 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Beginning October 1, 2015, RapidStart services will no longer be supported. For more information, see the announcement on CustomerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/northamerica/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued or PartnerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/news-events/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued.

To provide questions for a configuration project beyond those that are provided by Microsoft in Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services, you can create a structural hierarchy that begins with a template at the top level. You add one or more functional areas to the template. Each functional area contains one or more question groups, and each question group contains one or more questions.

The following illustration shows a basic template-to-question hierarchy.

Each template can have multiple functional areas. Each functional area can contain multiple question groups, and each question group can contain multiple questions. The following illustration shows a more complex template setup.

In the **Design** area of RapidStart Services, you can create and populate templates for both business processes and modules. When you create a configuration project in the **Configure** area, you can select a business process template or a module template, or you can create a custom template as you go by selecting from among all existing functional areas.
