# Create a location directive 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic applies to features in the <STRONG>Warehouse management</STRONG> module. It does not apply to features in the <A href="inventory-management.md">Inventory management</A> module.</P>



This topic explains how to create location directives. Location directives are user-defined rules that help identify pick and put locations for inventory movement. For example, in a sales order transaction, a location directive determines where the items will be picked and where the picked items will be put.

You can use location directives to do the following:

  - Put away incoming items.

  - Pick and stage items for outbound transactions.

  - Pick and put raw materials for production.

  - Replenish locations.

## Prerequisites

The following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you create a location directive.

## Create a location directive

To create a location directive, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Warehouse management** \> **Setup** \> **Location directives**.

2.  In the **Work order type** field, select the type of inventory transaction for which you want to create a location directive.

3.  On the **Location directives** FastTab, click **New** to create a new location directive and specify the details as described in the following table.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>

    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Sequence number</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the sequence in which the location directive is processed for the selected work type. You can also modify the sequence, if needed.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Name</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter a name for the location directive. This field is required.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Work type</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Select the type of work to be performed. The type of work available is based on the type of inventory transaction that you have selected in the <strong>Work order type</strong> field.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Site</strong></p></td>

    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Disposition code</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Optional: Select a disposition code to redirect the put away of the received items to a location.

    <div class="alert">

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If you have Hotfix number 3067743 or AX 2012 Cumulative Update 10 installed, the option is also available for Work orders of type <STRONG>Finished goods put away</STRONG>.</P>


    </div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Multiple SKU</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Optional: Select this check box to use multiple stock keeping units (SKUs).</p>
    <div class="alert">

    > [!NOTE]

    </div></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


4.  Optional: Click **Edit query** to select the locations or to specify any restrictions that apply when you select a specific location directive.

5.  On the **Lines** FastTab, create one or more lines to specify units and to locate or reserve quantity in a warehouse. Fill in the fields as described in the following table.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><p>Field</p></th>
    <th><p>Description</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Sequence number</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the sequence in which the location directive is processed for the selected work type. You can also modify the sequence, if needed.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>From quantity</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the starting quantity of the items for which work should be performed.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>To quantity</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the ending quantity of the items for which work should be performed.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Unit</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Select the unit of measure for the items.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Locate quantity</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Select the method that is used to check whether the quantity is in the range that is set in the <strong>From quantity</strong> and <strong>To quantity</strong> fields.</p>
    <p>If the location directive is for an inbound transaction, select one of the following options:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>License plate quantity</strong> ─ The license plate quantity.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Unitized quantity</strong> ─ The unitized quantity from the specified inventory transaction.</p>
    <p>For example, in a warehouse if you can receive a quantity of 1000 and break it into 10 license plates of 100 each, you can use a quantity of 1000 items instead of the license plate quantity of 100.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Remaining quantity</strong> ─ The quantity yet to be received that is specified on the purchase order line.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Expected quantity</strong> ─ The total quantity that is specified on the purchase order line.</p></li>
    </ul></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


6.  Optional: You can select the following additional settings on the **Lines** FastTab.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><p>Field</p></th>
    <th><p>Description</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Restrict by unit</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Select this check box to restrict the units of measure that are to be considered as valid selection criteria for the location directive lines. When units of measure have been specified, only those items with a unit that matches at least one unit defined for the unit sequence group will be considered as valid for the line selection.</p>
    <p>For example, say that the unit is restricted to pallets and the item is associated with a unit of measures sequence group that includes pallets. In this case the items will be considered a valid choice for the location directive.</p>
    <p>However, the <strong>Restrict by unit</strong> check box does not control the unit or units that are applied on work lines. The unit restriction only restricts the units that are made available via the unit sequence group.</p>
    <p>For example, say that an item is associated with a sequence group that includes both the Pallets and the Pcs units. A unit of measure has been defined with 1 pallet = 100 pcs and the location directive uses Restrict by unit for pallets only. Furthermore a work template has been defined that breaks the work header creation by 50 pcs. In this case work lines of 50 pcs will be created.</p>
    <p>To specify the unit of measure for restriction:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><p>Click <strong>Restrict by unit</strong>. This button is available only when you press <strong>Ctrl+S</strong> after you have selected the <strong>Restrict by unit</strong> check box.</p></li>
    <li><p>In the <strong>Unit</strong> field, select the unit of measure to restrict for the pick and put away process.</p></li>
    </ol></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Locate packing quantity</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Select this check box if a packing unit quantity is specified in the <strong>Sales order</strong> form. If you select this check box, only the locations with this packing unit quantity are selected.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Allow split</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Select this check box to split the quantity across multiple locations.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


7.  On the **Location Directive Actions** FastTab, click **New** to select the location or range of locations.

8.  In the **Sequence number** field, the sequence in which the location directive is processed for the selected work type is displayed. You can modify the sequence, if needed.

9.  In the **Name** field, enter the name for the location directive action.

10. Optional: Click **Edit query** to modify the warehouse locations and other criteria.

## Next step

After you create location directives, you can associate each directive code with a work template code for work creation.
