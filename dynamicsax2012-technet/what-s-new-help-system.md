# What's new: Help system 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The Help system in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 has been redesigned so that deployment and customization are easier. The following sections highlight the major features of the new Help system.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic describes only the Help system that is used by the Win32 client of Microsoft Dynamics AX. The Help system for Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX is based on Microsoft&nbsp;SharePoint technology. Therefore, the information in this topic does not apply to Enterprise Portal Help. For information about Enterprise Portal Help, see <A href="administering-enterprise-portal.md">Administering Enterprise Portal</A>.</P>



## Client/server architecture

In AX 2012, the Help system uses a client/server architecture. Help content is hosted on a dedicated server component, the Help server, which manages the storage and display of product documentation. The Help viewer, which is a component of the Microsoft Dynamics AX client, provides access to Help from individual workstations. In earlier versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX, Help was stored locally on each client system.

This new architecture provides the following benefits:

  - You can publish an HTML file to a web server when you want to add or change a topic.

  - You can deploy and manage Help from a centralized location.

  - You can more easily apply Help updates that are provided by Microsoft.

## The Help server

The Help server is an Internet Information Services (IIS) web server that is located inside your organization's local area network (LAN). When a Microsoft Dynamics AX user requests a topic, the Help server receives the request, locates the topic on the LAN, and sends the topic to the Help viewer. The Help viewer then displays the topic.

For information about how to install and configure the Help server, see [Deployment of the Help server](deployment-of-the-help-server.md) and [Help server operations](help-server-operations.md).

## The Help viewer

You can open the Help viewer by using the **Help** menu in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client, clicking the **Help** button in a Microsoft Dynamics AX form, or clicking links in various parts of the Microsoft Dynamics AX client. The viewer contains two panes. One pane contains a table of contents that represents the documentation that is available on the Help server. The other pane displays a topic that is selected in the **Contents** pane.

You can perform the following tasks by using the Help viewer:

  - Browse topic titles in the **Contents** pane.

  - Read topics in the display pane, and follow links to other topics and to Microsoft Dynamics AX forms.

  - Search the topics on the Help server by entering keywords in the **Search** field.

## Customization

The content for the Help system is stored in HTML files and deployed on a standard web server. Therefore, the Help system can easily be customized. Microsoft Dynamics AX has extensive Help resources that you can use, modify, or replace to meet your requirements. You can also control the way that topics are returned in user searches.

## Customizing topics

You can customize Help content in the following ways.

## Customizing search

Search capability on the Help server is enabled by Windows Search Service, which supports both full-text search and keyword search. By default, Microsoft Dynamics AX Help content is configured for keyword search. However, you can select whether full-text search or keyword search is used. You can also use both kinds of search and specify a priority for each kind. In addition to customizing Help content, you can customize and use search in the following ways to meet your organization's requirements.

<td><p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg882357(v=ax.60)">Description Element</a></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Web connectivity

The Microsoft Help that is included with Microsoft Dynamics AX is also published on the web, where it is updated and supplemented by other Help resources. From the **Help** menu in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client, power users, system administrators, and developers can connect to web-based Help on TechNet and MSDN. Users who cannot find appropriate search results by using the Help viewer can continue their searches on the web without re-entering the search terms. A web search tool provides filtered searches that return focused search results.

## Support for multiple publishers

## Are there any special considerations?

To enable the customization of Help documentation, you have to add a folder to the Help server. Writers then put documentation files in this folder. A writer that publishes documentation files has to have write or modify security permissions to the folder.
