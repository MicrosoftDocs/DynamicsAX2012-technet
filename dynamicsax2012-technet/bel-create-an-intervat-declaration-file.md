# (BEL) Create an INTERVAT declaration file 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use the **INTERVAT tax declaration** form to enter tax header declaration information, general information, and date and signature information for the INTERVAT declaration file.

You can create the INTERVAT declaration as an XML file. You can also include corrections in the INTERVAT declaration from the previous year. Additionally, if you did not have transactions for a turnover report or an annual listing during the previous financial year, you can indicate that this is an empty annual listing. For more information, see [(BEL) Additional sales tax report boxes (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa599851\(v=ax.60\)).
