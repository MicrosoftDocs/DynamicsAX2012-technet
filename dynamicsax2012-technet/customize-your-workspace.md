# Customize your workspace 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Microsoft Dynamics AX includes several features to help you customize the appearance of your workspace. For example, you can customize the list of buttons that appear in the Navigation Pane, and you can hide or display the Navigation Pane, the Favorites pane, or the content page.

## Select which buttons to display in the Navigation Pane

You can easily customize the Navigation Pane to display only the buttons for the folders and forms that you use most.

1.  On the **View** menu (next to the Help icon in the main application window), click **Navigation Pane Options**.

2.  Select the check box for each button to display in the Navigation Pane.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Click <STRONG>Reset</STRONG> to reset the list of buttons to the default settings.</P>



3.  Click **OK**.

## Show or hide elements of the workspace

Using the **View** menu (next to the Help icon in the main application window), you can show or hide the following areas of the Microsoft Dynamics AX workspace:

  - Preview Pane

  - FactBox Pane

  - FactBoxes – You can show or hide specific FactBoxes.

  - Favorites – You can show or hide the Favorites area of the Navigation Pane.

  - Navigation Pane

## Auto-hide the Navigation Pane

On the **View** menu, click **Auto-Hide Navigation** to automatically collapse the Navigation Pane to the left side of the workspace, in the sidebar. You can expand the Navigation Pane again by moving your mouse pointer to the sidebar. When you expand the Navigation Pane in this way, the pane is displayed over the content page. To collapse the pane again, click outside the pane. To remove this setting, click **Auto-Hide Navigation** on the **View** menu again.

## Change language and help language

You can change the user interface and help language by using the following procedure.

The language selection applies to the following components:

  - The Microsoft Dynamics AX Client

  - Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX

  - The Microsoft Excel planning client


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Additional languages for Microsoft Dynamics AX require additional licenses. To learn how to acquire additional language licenses, contact your Microsoft partner.</P>



## To set a user's default language

1.  From a Microsoft Dynamics AX client, click **File** \> **Tools** \> **Options**.

2.  In the **Language** field, select a language for your user interface.

3.  In the **Alternate help language** field, select a help language if it differs from the user interface language.

4.  Click **Close**.
    
    For your changes to take effect, you must close and restart Microsoft Dynamics AX.
