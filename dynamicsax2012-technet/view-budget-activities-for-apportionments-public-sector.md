    You can view all of the budget register entries that includes original budget and apportionments, on the **Budget register entries** list page.

  - **Period budgets** (Click **Budgeting** \> **Common** \> **Budget register entries** \> **All budget register entries**. Select a budget account entry and then click **Related information** \> **Budget register entries** \> **Budget balances**.)
    
    Use this form to view budget and apportionment balances by period, accumulated amounts, and the accumulated percentage of the sum of the budget and apportionments for all periods.

  - **Budget control statistics** (Click **Budgeting** \> **Inquiries** \> **Budget control statistics**.)
    
    Use this form to view the budget balances for a budget cycle and budget model. For additional details, select a line in the grid and then click **Apportionments**. After purchase requisitions and purchase orders have been posted, you can use the **Budget control statistics** form to view the budget reservations for encumbrances and pre-encumbrances.

  - **Ledger - actual vs. budget inquiry** (Click **Budgeting** \> **Inquiries** \> **Actual vs. budget**.)
    
    Use this form to view actual expenditures versus the sum for the budget register entries for the period. The **Apportionments** field contains a sum of all the apportionment budget register entries for the budget model and dimensions values. The **Variance amount** field displays the result of the following calculation: Apportionment for the period – Actual for the period = Variance amount for the period.
