# (CHE) Swiss LSV+ electronic payment format 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The Swiss electronic payment system enables companies to deduct customer payments directly from a customerâ€™s bank, also known as direct debit or Lastschriftenverfahren (LSV). To enable this kind of payment, you and your customer sign a contract in advance. To deduct customer payments, you must send a payment file to the bank, and the bank collects the payments requested in the file. You then download a file together with received customer payments and a reference number that corresponds to the invoice for the payment. Alternatively, the bank provides a report that shows the processed LSV payments, and the payments can be entered manually in a payment journal.

You can generate a direct debit payment file directly within Microsoft Dynamics AX. This payment file format (LSV+) is required for compliance with Swiss banking standards starting November 1, 2006.

Payments can be submitted for euro currency, and payment reference numbers are included with the customer payment file, also known as an Enzahlungsschein mit Referenznummer (ESR) file.
