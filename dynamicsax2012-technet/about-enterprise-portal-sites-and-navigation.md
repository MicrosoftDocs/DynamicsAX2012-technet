# About Enterprise Portal sites and navigation 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This topic describes some of the basic concepts that are related to Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX. To understand how you can use Enterprise Portal for your daily work, you must understand these concepts.

## Site structure

The pages in Enterprise Portal are organized by Role Centers and module sites. Your ability to access Role Centers and module sites depends on how your Microsoft Dynamics AX administrator configured your role, security features, site permissions, and a new feature in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 called data partitioning. If a partition is specified, you are automatically redirected to the Enterprise Portal site and the partition configured by your administrator. If you attempt to log into Enterprise Portal and you have not been granted permission in the partition you receive an access denied message. If you receive an access denied message, speak with your Microsoft Dynamics AX administrator.

## Role Centers

If your organization is using Role Centers, your Role Center is the first page that you see when you open Enterprise Portal. The page displays an overview of information that is relevant to users in your role. If your organization is not using Role Centers, an Enterprise Portal home page is displayed. For more information about Role Centers, see [Role Centers (Enterprise Portal)](role-centers-enterprise-portal.md).

## Module sites

Typically, module sites represent the departments or roles in an organization, such as Sales or Employee Services. Each module site includes pages that you can use to view information about the department or role. You can also use the pages to complete tasks that are related to the department or role.

## Navigation

You can use the following page elements to open pages in Enterprise Portal and switch between companies.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The options that are available in these elements may vary, depending on your permissions.</P>



## Top link bar

Use the top link bar to open module sites. The module sites that you have access to depend on the roles that you are assigned to. Click a module site on the top link bar to view the site's home page.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Depending on how Enterprise Portal was implemented or customized, the names of the module sites can vary. For example, the <STRONG>Home</STRONG> site may be displayed as <STRONG>EP Site</STRONG>. This Help uses the default names of module sites.</P>



## Quick Launch

The Quick Launch is located on the left side of most Enterprise Portal pages. The Quick Launch includes links to list pages, report pages, task pages, and other types of pages. For more information, see [About Enterprise Portal pages](about-enterprise-portal-pages.md).

## Company list

If you have access to multiple companies that are set up in Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can view information for, and work with, one company at a time in Enterprise Portal. To select a company, use the **Company** list in the upper-right corner of the page.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you select a company in the list, but you do not have permission to view data or other information for that company, an error page is displayed.</P>



## \<User name\> menu

You can use the **\<User name\>** menu in the upper-right corner of the page to access user-specific options. You can also use the **Personalize this Page** option to change your personal view of a page. For more information about these options, see the SharePoint documentation.
