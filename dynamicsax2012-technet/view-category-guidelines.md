# View category guidelines 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use this procedure to view the guidelines for a procurement category. Procurement category guidelines consist of rules that employees must follow when they add a product from a procurement category to a purchase requisition. The guidelines can contain rules about vendor selection for the product; announcements, such as a sale on a product; or policies set by your organization, such as when a product must be recorded as a fixed asset. Your purchasing manager defines these guidelines and policies for a procurement category in Microsoft Dynamics AX.

The following are additional examples of procurement category guidelines:

  - You must complete a questionnaire after you complete your purchase of a procurement category item.

  - The vendor is offering a discount, for a limited time, on purchases of the selected procurement category item.

  - You must assign a fixed asset group to the product you purchase in the selected procurement category.
