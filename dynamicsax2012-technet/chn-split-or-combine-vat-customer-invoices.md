Use the **VAT invoice integration** form to manually split a VAT customer invoice that has a total invoice amount that exceeds the amount limit that you specify in the **Maximum invoice amount** field in the **Tax integration profiles** form.

To split a VAT customer invoice, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Periodic** \> **Tax integration** \> **VAT invoice integration**.

2.  In the upper pane, select a VAT customer invoice to split. You can split VAT customer invoices for which the **Over amount limit** check box is selected.

3.  Click **Split** to open the **Split export documents** form.

4.  In the **Split based on** field, select one of the following options to indicate the method to use to split the VAT customer invoice:
    
      - **Amount** – Split the invoice based on the amounts that you specify. You can specify the split amounts in the **Amount** field in the lower pane, and then click **Split** to split the invoice.
    
      - **Percent** – Split the invoice based on the percentages that you specify. You can specify the split percentages in the **Percent** field in the lower pane, and then click **Split** to split the invoice.
    
      - **Quantity** – Split the invoice based on the quantities that you specify. Click **Split**, and then specify the split quantities in the **Split quantity** field. Click **OK**.
