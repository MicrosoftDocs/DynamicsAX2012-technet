# Set up integration with Microsoft Office Add-ins 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Microsoft Dynamics AX can be integrated with Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. If your organization uses the Office Add-ins for Microsoft Dynamics AX, users can create Word documents and Excel workbooks that are linked dynamically to the tables in Microsoft Dynamics AX. Integration for the Office Add-ins must be set up before users can use the Office Add-ins to create files.

Use the following procedure to configure data sources for the Office Add-ins.

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Document management** \> **Document data sources**.

2.  In the **Document data sources** form, click **New**.

3.  In the **Module** field, select the Microsoft Dynamics AX module from which a user can open and create files. For example, select **Sales and marketing** to enter the settings for a sales quotation.

4.  In the **Data source type** field, select one of the following options:
    
      - If the user wants to create files that other users can modify, select **Service**.
    
      - If the user wants to create files that only the user can modify, select **Query**.

5.  In the **Data source name** field, select the applicable data source.

6.  Select the **Activated** check box.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The Office Add-ins are not supported by versions of Microsoft Office earlier than Microsoft Office 2007.</P>
