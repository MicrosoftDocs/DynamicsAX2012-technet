# Adding Links to a Report 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This section provides information about how to add links in a Microsoft Dynamics AX report. Visual Studio tools for Microsoft Dynamics AX supports links for the following actions:

  - A **Report Drill Through Action** lets you link to other reports. When defining a report drill through action, there are two reports involved: the top-level report and the drillthrough report. The top-level report is where the report drill through action is defined. The drillthrough report is opened by the user by clicking a link within the top-level report. It lets the user drill through to additional data about the item that was clicked in the top-level report. Parameters can be used to pass data from the top-level report to the drillthrough report. It is not required that you pass data to a drillthrough report. For example, you might display codes on your report and link to a list that describes what each code represents.

  - A **URL Drill Through Action** lets you add a hyperlink so that users can access a web page, an Enterprise Portal page, or a form in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client by clicking a linked item in a report. The hyperlink can be a static URL or an expression that evaluates to a URL.

The following topics describe how to create each type of link:
