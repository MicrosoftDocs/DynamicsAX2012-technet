# About importing data from Microsoft Excel 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Data can be imported into Microsoft Dynamics AX by using a variety of tools and techniques. Some tools and techniques require extensive knowledge of the Microsoft Dynamics AX system and internal structure, and should be used only by a developer or system administrator. For more information about using developer tools to import data, see [Plan data import, export, and migration](plan-data-import-export-and-migration.md).

You can also import data into Microsoft Dynamics AX by using Microsoft Excel. Use either of the following methods:

  - Create an Excel file, and then convert it to an XML file that complies with the field names, character limitations, and other data requirements for Microsoft Dynamics AX. This method should be used only by a developer or system administrator who is familiar with the tables in the Microsoft Dynamics AX database.

  - Export a form, list, or report to Excel, enter data in the applicable columns in the file, and then import the updated data back into Microsoft Dynamics AX. We recommend that you use this method to update existing records and to import smaller data sets. For more information about how to update records by using Excel, see [Update Microsoft Dynamics AX data by using Microsoft Excel](update-microsoft-dynamics-ax-data-by-using-microsoft-excel.md).
