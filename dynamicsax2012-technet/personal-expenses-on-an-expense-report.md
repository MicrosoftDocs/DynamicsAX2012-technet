# Personal expenses on an expense report 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

During business travel, workers may sometimes charge personal expenses to their corporate credit cards. If you do not define a process for personal expenses, the approval process for expense reports may be disrupted when workers submit their itemized expense reports. In Microsoft Dynamics AX, there are two methods for dealing with a worker's personal expenses:

  - **Employee paid** – Your organization does not pay the personal expenses on the corporate credit card bill. Instead, it creates a report that displays personal expenses together with the corporate expenses that were charged to the corporate credit card.

  - **Company paid** – Your organization pays the whole corporate credit card bill, and then debits the worker’s account for the personal expenses.

You can select the method that you want to use for your organization in the **Travel and expense parameters** form. Click **Travel and expense** \> **Setup** \> **Travel and expense parameters**.
