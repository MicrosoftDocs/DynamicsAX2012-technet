# About invoiced revenue

## Parameter dependencies

**Invoiced revenue**

  - In the **Line properties** form, on the **General** FastTab, the **Chargeable** check box must be selected under **Invoicing**.

**Invoiced revenue â€“ On-account**

  - In the **Project groups** form, on the **Ledger** FastTab, **Profit and loss** must be selected in the **On-account invoicing** field.
    
    When a new project group is created, the **On-account invoicing** field is set to a default value that is based on the project type. This default value can be changed only for Time and material projects and Fixed-price projects. For other project types, the default value cannot be changed.
    
    For Time and material projects, the default value is **Balance**. For Fixed-price projects, the default value is **Profit and loss**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>For Fixed-price projects, selections made in the <STRONG>Fixed-price</STRONG> area in the <STRONG>Estimate</STRONG> form can change the values that are permitted in this field.</P>
