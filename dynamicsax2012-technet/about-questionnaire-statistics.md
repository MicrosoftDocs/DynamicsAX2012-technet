# About questionnaire statistics 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use questionnaire statistics to analyze the results of a completed questionnaire that is based on calculations that you define. For more information, see [Viewing and evaluating results](viewing-and-evaluating-results.md) and [Using questionnaires](using-questionnaires.md).

Defining calculations involves the following steps:

  - Select criteria to calculate and display the statistics.
    
      - Display statistics by questionnaire, questions, question rows, or results groups.
    
      - Select the type of graph to use when you view results.
    
      - Select the types of people from the network, such as employee, contact person, or applicant, whose answers that you want to include. You can also include answers from questionnaires that were completed anonymously.
    
      - Set up intervals that are based on age or seniority to analyze results.

  - Select or view settings that refine the subject of the statistics. For example, by selecting a ZIP or postal code, you can analyze results for all respondents within that geographic area.

  - Select or view criteria to analyze results by respondent or questionnaire characteristics. For example, by selecting ZIP/postal code, you can analyze the correlation between a respondentâ€™s location and correct answers.

The settings that you define are saved and can be used to periodically recalculate results.
