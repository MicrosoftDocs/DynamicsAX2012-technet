# Set up visual profiles (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to set up the appearance of Retail POS registers. For example, you can select menus that you want to appear on the register screen and define the colors and bars that are visible.

The information that determines the appearance of the register is specified in a visual profile. You can create several visual profiles and then select the profiles that you want to run on specific registers. You can also decide whether to allow a store to modify a visual profile that you assign to a register.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Retail essentials, the form that you use to complete this task includes a subset of the controls that are available for other configurations of Retail. If a topic about this form describes controls that you don't see, it may be because youâ€™re using Retail essentials.</P>
