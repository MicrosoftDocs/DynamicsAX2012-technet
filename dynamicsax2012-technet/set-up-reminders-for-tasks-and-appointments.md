# Set up reminders for tasks and appointments [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When you create an activity task or appointment in Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can add a reminder for the activity. You can also add a reminder to an existing task or appointment.

1.  Click **Home** \> **Common** \> **Activities** \> **All activities**. On the **Action Pane**, in the **New** group, click **Appointment** or **Task**. Alternatively, on the **All activities** list page, select the task or appointment that you want to update. Then, on the **Action Pane**, in the **Maintain** group, click **Edit**.

2.  In the **Activities** form, on the **General** FastTab, select the **Reminder** check box to add a reminder to the activity.

3.  Select the date and enter the time that you want the reminder to occur. For example, you select the date of the activity and enter 11:15 for an appointment that starts at 11:30. Alternatively, you set the reminder for the day before the appointment.

4.  If you are creating a new activity, enter the remaining information for the activity.
