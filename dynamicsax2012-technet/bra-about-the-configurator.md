# (BRA) About the configurator 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

The configurator is a file interface configuration service that is used to manage the method of payment file formats for electronic payments and electronic fiscal documents for services.

You can perform the following tasks to set up and use the configurator:

  - Create configurator definition groups and layout groups for the file formats. For more information, see [(BRA) Set up the configurator definition group](bra-set-up-the-configurator-definition-group.md) and [(BRA) Set up the configurator layout group](bra-set-up-the-configurator-layout-group.md).

  - Export or import the layout groups. For more information, see [(BRA) Export or import layout group data](bra-export-or-import-layout-group-data.md).

  - Export data from definition groups or layout groups by using the Configurator export utility. For more information, see [(BRA) Export data from definition groups or layout groups using the Configurator export utility](bra-export-data-from-definition-groups-or-layout-groups-using-the-configurator-export-utility.md).

You can create a definition group by defining the tables and fields that are used as a basis for configuring the layouts for the export or import process. You can then create a layout group that defines the file structure used to import or export data, and you must attach a definition group to a layout group.
