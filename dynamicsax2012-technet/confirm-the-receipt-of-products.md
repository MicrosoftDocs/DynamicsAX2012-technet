# Confirm the receipt of products 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When you order a product such as a new office desk, and the purchase is then confirmed, a product receipt that has not yet been confirmed becomes available on the **Unconfirmed product receipts** page on Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX. The product receipt indicates the expected date of delivery of the ordered product. When the product arrives, you must confirm the receipt of the product. You need to do this to indicate that you accept the delivery. You do this on the **Unconfirmed product receipts** page.

1.  Click **Procurement** on the top link bar, and then click **Unconfirmed product receipts** on the Quick Launch.

2.  Select the product receipt that you want to confirm. On the **Action Pane**, on the **Confirmation of product receipt** tab, in the **Update** group, click **Receive**.

3.  Approve or change the received quantity, and then click the **Close line** check box if you want to close the purchase order line.

4.  Click **Save and close** to save the changes, if any, and return to the **Unconfirmed product receipts** page. The product receipt that you have just confirmed is no longer visible in the list.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Click <STRONG>Product receipts</STRONG> on the Quick Launch to view the product receipt that you confirmed on the <STRONG>Unconfirmed product receipts</STRONG> page.</P>
