1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Common** \> **Purchase orders** \> **All purchase orders**.

2.  Click the **Purchase** tab, and then click **Credit note** to create a credit note. Attach the related purchase order to the credit note.

3.  Select the **Tax as per original invoice** check box to apply the tax rate for excise as it was on the date the original order was invoiced.
    
    For example, a purchase order is invoiced on April 10, 2008, and the rate of BED on this date is 12%. A credit note is posted on May 21, 2008, and the rate of excise on this date is 15%.
    
      - If you select the **Tax as per original invoice** check box, the tax rate for the calculation of excise on the credit note will be 12%.
    
      - If the **Tax as per original invoice** check box is not selected, the tax rate will be 15%.

4.  Select the transactions for creating the credit note.

5.  Post the credit note. The excise duty is calculated for the number of items returned. You can modify the values entered in the fields that are related to excise or delete any of the values in these fields before posting the credit note.
