# Learn about functional areas in RapidStart Services 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Beginning October 1, 2015, RapidStart services will no longer be supported. For more information, see the announcement on CustomerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/northamerica/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued or PartnerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/news-events/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued.

In Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services, functional areas are used to aggregate related question groups. For example, the functional area “Process customer payments” is a default functional area that is provided by Microsoft in RapidStart Services. This functional area contains question groups that include questions that relate to customer payments, customer payment sales taxes, and credit card payments. The functional area “Manage fixed assets” consists of question groups that address depreciation, acquisition, and fixed assets.

You can use the **Design** area in RapidStart Services to create new functional areas to help meet your configuration goals for a Microsoft Dynamics ERP application.

**Example**

You are a company that is providing RapidStart Services to a customer in Bangladesh. Because of different financial requirements in Bangladesh, the set of default functional areas that are provided by Microsoft do not address all the parameters that the customer wants to configure by using RapidStart Services. Therefore, you create a new functional area called “Bangladeshtaxes,” and then create the required question groups and questions to add to this functional area.

You can add one or more functional areas to the template that you use to create the configuration project for your customer. For information about templates, see [Learn about templates in RapidStart Services](learn-about-templates-in-rapidstart-services.md).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>When you create a new configuration project in the Configure area, you can choose to create a custom template as you go. Select any combination of functional areas instead of selecting a template that you created in the <STRONG>Design</STRONG> area.</P>
