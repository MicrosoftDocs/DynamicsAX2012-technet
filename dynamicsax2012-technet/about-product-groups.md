# About product groups 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The products that are represented as items in the **Items** table must be organized and filtered in a way that is suited to presentation on the Internet. This is performed in product groups in Microsoft Dynamics AX. The product groups are organized in a tree structure with two possible node types:

  - Group nodes – Hold item nodes or group nodes, or both, on a lower level in the product group hierarchy.

  - Item nodes – Hold the selected product items from your inventory.
