# Set up Procurement and sourcing workflows 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Some organizations require that vendor requests, purchase requisitions, and unconfirmed product receipts be approved by a user other than the person who entered the transaction. To set up an approval process, you can create a workflow.

A workflow represents a business process. It defines how a document flows through the system and indicates who must complete a task or approve a document. There are several benefits of using the workflow system in your organization:

  - **Consistent processes** — You can define the approval process for specific documents, such as purchase requisitions and expense reports. Using the workflow system helps to ensure that documents are processed and approved in a consistent and efficient manner.

  - **Process visibility** — You can track the status, history, and performance metrics of a specific workflow instance. This helps you determine whether changes should be made to the workflow to improve efficiency.

  - **Centralized work list** — Users can view a centralized work list to view the workflow tasks and approvals assigned to them. This work list is available from the Role Center pages in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client and Enterprise Portal.

For an overview of workflow in Microsoft Dynamics AX, see [Overview of the workflow system](overview-of-the-workflow-system.md) and [Workflow concepts](workflow-concepts.md). For information about how to set up workflows, see [Configuring the workflow system](configuring-the-workflow-system.md).
