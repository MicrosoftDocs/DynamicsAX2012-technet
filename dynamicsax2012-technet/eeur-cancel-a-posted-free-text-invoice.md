# (EEUR) Cancel a posted free text invoice 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use this procedure to cancel a free text invoice that has been posted. If you want to cancel an invoice and create a corrected invoice at the same time, see [Correct a posted free text invoice](correct-a-posted-free-text-invoice.md).

When you cancel a posted invoice, a canceling invoice is created. The combined balance of the original invoice and the canceling invoice is 0 (zero). For example, if you cancel a posted invoice that has a balance of 500.00, the canceling invoice that is created has a balance of -500.00. Therefore, the combined balance of the original and canceling invoices is 0.00.
