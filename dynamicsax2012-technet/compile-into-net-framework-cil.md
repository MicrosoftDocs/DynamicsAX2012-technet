# Compile into .NET Framework CIL 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The **Compile into .NET Framework CIL** task converts your compiled application code into Common Intermediate Language (CIL) code that can be consumed by the MicrosoftÂ .NET Framework.

## The purpose of CIL

CIL is the bytecode language that the just-in-time (JIT) compiler of the .NET Framework interprets. Microsoft Dynamics AX converts compiled X++ code, or p-code, to CIL. This conversion provides interoperability with .NET classes, and it also improves performance. The following Microsoft Dynamics AX components rely on the speed of CIL:

  - Batch jobs

  - Application Integration Framework (AIF) and services

  - Run-as scenarios, in which .NET functions are substituted for X++ functions at run time

## Scenarios that require the CIL task

You may have to run the **Compile into .NET Framework CIL** task in the following two scenarios:

  - You are installing Microsoft Dynamics AX, and you encounter the task in the **Initialization checklist**.

  - You are performing an upgrade on a Microsoft Dynamics AX system that includes customized application code, and you encounter the task in either the **AOD code upgrade checklist** or the **Model code upgrade checklist**.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> <P>In all checklists that include the <STRONG>Compile into .NET Framework CIL</STRONG> task, the previous task is <STRONG>Compile application</STRONG>. You must complete the <STRONG>Compile application</STRONG> task before you can perform the <STRONG>Compile into .NET Framework CIL</STRONG> task.</P>
