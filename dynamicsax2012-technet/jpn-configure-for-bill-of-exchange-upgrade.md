# (JPN) Configure for bill of exchange upgrade 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 simplifies how bills of exchange are endorsed. The **Preprocessing upgrade checklist** task **Configure for bill of exchange upgrade** opens a form with the same name that allows you to configure certain financial transactions affected by upgrade.

## Changes to bill of exchange (BOE) support

A bill of exchange is endorsed by a company to a vendor with which it has a business relationship. During data upgrade preprocessing, in the **Accounts receivable parameters** form, on the **Settlement** tab, the **Allow endorsement of BOE** check box will appear selected. During data upgrade on the target system, the upgrade framework makes the following changes to a bill of exchange:

  - It generates the bill of exchange transaction for the credit side.

  - It generates the payment journal transaction for the debit side.

  - It updates the bill of exchange with a status of **Endorsed**.

For each company on the source system, you must specify the following information.

  - The number sequence to use for bills of exchange.

  - A bridge account for the transactions that are created on the target system.
