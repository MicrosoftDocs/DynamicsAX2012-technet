2.  In the **Cash** field, select a cash account code.

3.  In the **Start date** and **To date** fields, specify the date range for the report.

4.  In the **Specification** field, select the cash variance:
    
      - **Balances** − Amount differences for cash account balances only.
    
      - **Cash transactions** − Amount differences for all transactions.
