# Purchase cube (PurchCube) for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 and R3 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

The Purchase cube for Microsoft Dynamics AX is used to report on purchase transactions. This article provides details about the cube.

## Units of measure and reporting with the Purchase cube

When working with Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services reports that display a quantity of an item, the appropriate unit of measure must be incorporated into the report to make sure that the quantity is correct, instead of just presenting a SUM value.

For the Quantity measures in the purchase unit of measure, slicing on the Purchase Units dimension separates the quantities by unit of measure. Quantity measures in inventory unit of measure can be sliced by the Unit dimension, which represents the inventory unit.

## Deployment

The Purchase cube is included in the Dynamics AX project. For information about how deploy the Dynamics AX project—and the cubes that it contains—see [Deploy the default cubes](deploy-the-default-cubes.md).

## Configuration keys

The following configuration keys are required to use all features of the Purchase cube:

  - General ledger (LedgerBasic)

  - Trade (LogisticsBasic)

## Tables and views

The Purchase cube uses data from the following tables and views:

  - DlvMode table

  - InventBuyerGroup table

  - VendInvoiceJour table

  - InventTableExpanded view

  - PurchLineExpanded view

  - TAMVendRebateExpanded view

  - VendInvoiceTransExpanded view

  - VendPackingSlipTransStage view

  - VendTableCube view


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The TAMVendRebateExpanded view is used with this cube only in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3.</P>



## Measures

The Purchase cube includes the following measure groups.

## Released products

This measure group is based on the InventTableExpanded view and includes the following measures.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 20%" />
<col style="width: 20%" />
<col style="width: 20%" />

<p>Configurations</p>
<p>Sizes</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Purchase lines

This measure group is based on the PurchLineExpanded view and includes the measures in the following table.

From the measures it is possible to read the cycle time in calendar days that it takes for a purchase to be fulfilled. The measure is based on events on a purchase line. The events on a purchase line included in this context are:

  - Confirming the purchase order the first time; the delivery date on the purchase line is the requested date

  - Adding the confirmed delivery date after the purchase order has been confirmed

  - Registering the first product receipt (fully received or partially received)

  - Registering the last product receipt (first product receipt = last product receipt if there is only one)

Only purchase order lines where the products are received by products receipts and have status received or invoiced are included in the cube measures.
