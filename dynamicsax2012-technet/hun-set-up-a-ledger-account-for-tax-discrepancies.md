  - Invoices

  - Free text invoices

  - Project invoices

  - Credit notes

  - Corrective invoices

Companies are free to select the exchange rate used to calculate VAT for the VAT statement. The exchange rate selected for VAT calculation can be different from the exchange rate used for company accounting functions.
