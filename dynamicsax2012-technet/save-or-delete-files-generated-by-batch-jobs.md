1.  Click **Home** \> **Inquiries** \> **Batch jobs** \> **Generated files**.

2.  In the left pane, click the name of the batch job that is associated with the files that you want to find.
    
    When you select a batch job, the files that are associated with it are displayed in the right pane.

3.  To save the file, click **Save**.

4.  To delete the file, click **Remove**.
