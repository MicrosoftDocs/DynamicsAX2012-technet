# (RUS) About the bailment process 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

The bailment process involves the transfer of items from a bailor (owner of items) to a bailee (holder of items) for storage purposes.The bailment process includes the following tasks:

1.  Registering an agreement for bailment – A bailor and a bailee sign an agreement that includes details such as the account numbers of the bailor and the bailee, the price of the items for storage, the length of the storage period, and the number of free storage days that are allowed for the bailor.

2.  Transferring items for storage – The bailor transfers the items for storage, ships a transfer order, and generates a Bill of lading (1-T) and an Issue slip (M-15).

3.  Receiving items for storage – The bailee receive the items for storage, creates a purchase order, and generates the Acceptance report in storage (MX-1).

4.  Tracking items in storage – The bailee generates a Counting list (INV-5) report to track the items in storage.

5.  Returning items from storage – The bailee creates a sales order for the item storage and generates the Return report from storage (MX-3). The bailee calculates the cost of storage, and then the sales order with a service of goods storage is created.

6.  Receiving items from storage – The bailor receives the items from storage and creates a transfer order.
