The following information describes how to enter a one-time depreciation transaction. For example, you might need to enter a transaction for a one-time tax benefit.

1.  Create a depreciation profile using the **Manual** depreciation method. For more information, see [Create a depreciation profile](create-a-depreciation-profile.md).

2.  For a new value model, in the **Extraordinary depreciation profile** field, select the depreciation profile that you created. For more information, see [Value models setup (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/aa582567\(v=ax.60\)).

3.  Attach the new value model to the fixed asset. For more information, see [Set up fixed asset groups](set-up-fixed-asset-groups.md) and [Fixed assets (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/aa620341\(v=ax.60\)).
