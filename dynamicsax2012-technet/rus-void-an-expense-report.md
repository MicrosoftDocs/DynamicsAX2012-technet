2.  Select the advance report to void.

3.  Click **Rejection**. The status of the advance report is set to **Rejected**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>When an advance report is rejected, reversed transactions are created for the advance holder. The <STRONG>Reversed</STRONG> check box is automatically selected in the <STRONG>Advance holder transactions</STRONG> form. The transactions are settled and reversed automatically.</P>
