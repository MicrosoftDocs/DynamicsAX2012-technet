# About journal names 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Journal names are the templates that you select from when you create journals for cost transactions and service transactions. You can create journal names in the **Journal names** form.

Click **Cost accounting** \> **Setup** \> **Journal names**. For more information, see [Journal name (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa590520\(v=ax.60\))

You can create two types of journals:

  - **Cost** – This type of journal is used for cost transactions.

  - **Services** – This type of journal is used for service transactions.

In addition to selecting the journal type, you must enter other information when you create a journal name, including information about posting, approval, offset transactions, and voucher series.
