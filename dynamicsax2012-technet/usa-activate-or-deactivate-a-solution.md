1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Sites Services** \> **Available solutions**.

2.  In the list of solutions on the left, select a solution.
    
    The list of solution includes the solutions you create, in addition to the solutions that are included with Microsoft Dynamics AX.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>On the right, you can view information about the selected solution, including the dates that the solution was last activated and updated.</P>



3.  Click **Activate** or **Deactivate**.
