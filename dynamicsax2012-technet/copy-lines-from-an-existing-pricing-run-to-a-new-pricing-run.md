1.  Click **Inventory management** \> **Periodic** \> **Commodity pricing** \> **Pricing calculation**.

2.  Select the new pricing calculation.

3.  Click **Copy**. The **Copy pricing calculation** form is displayed.

4.  In the **Pricing calculation** field, select the pricing calculation with the lines you want to copy.

5.  Click **OK**. The lines from the selected pricing calculation are copied to the new pricing calculation.

6.  To update information for the new pricing calculation, click **Commodity pricing** and make any changes.
