## Distribute an expense

You may want to assign responsibility for an expense to more than one group, organization, or party record. The expense amount can then be distributed among those groups, organizations, or parties. For example, you travel to Germany for 10 working days. You spend six days working for legal entity A and four days working for legal entity B. When you distribute the expense amount, legal entity A is responsible for 60 percent of the expenses, and legal entity B is responsible for the remaining 40 percent.

When you are distributing expenses for a project, you can view information for your projects in the project validation forms in Microsoft Dynamics AX. However, you cannot filter projects by legal entity. Regardless of the legal entity that you are logged on to, you see the same list of projects. For example, if you are logged on to LE1, you see the same list of projects that you would see if you were logged on to LE2.

1.  On the **Edit expense report** page, select the expense that you want to distribute, and then click **Other** \> **Distribute amounts**.

2.  On the **Distribute amounts** page, select whether you want to distribute the expense as an amount or a percentage.

3.  Select the legal entity, project ID, and category to which you are distributing one part of the expense.

4.  Enter the amount or percentage that you want to distribute, and then click the check mark icon to save your entry.

5.  Click **Split** to add another line. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have distributed the total expense.
    
    If you want to distribute the expense amount equally among the legal entities, click **Distribute equally**.

## Add an intercompany expense to an expense report in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2

You can add intercompany expenses to an existing expense report. For more information about how to add intercompany expenses to an expense report, see [Key tasks: Create expense reports](key-tasks-create-expense-reports.md).

If you have created an intercompany expense report and the expense report should not include intercompany expenses, on the **Expense lines** FastTab, remove all intercompany expenses, and then on the **Expense report** FastTab, clear the **Intercompany expense report** check box.

## Split a credit card transaction to include a personal expense

Part of an expense transaction that you charge to your corporate credit card may consist of a personal expense. For example, the total expense for a meal is EUR 65, but your spouse/partner joined you for the meal. Because your spouse/partner's meal is not covered by your organization, you can split the transaction. The cost of your spouse/partner's meal is then listed as a personal expense that you owe to your organization.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can split a credit card transaction to include a personal expense only if the credit card transaction has been imported into Microsoft Dynamics AX. You cannot manually enter a transaction and then split it.</P>



1.  On the **Edit expense report** page, on the **Expense lines** tab, select the imported transaction that you want to split, and then click **Split to personal**.

2.  Enter the amount of the transaction that you want to assign as a business expense.

3.  Select **Add remaining to personal**, and then click **Save and close**.

## Return a cash advance on an expense report

If you receive a cash advance from your organization, but you do not spend the whole amount, you can create an expense line on an expense report to return the rest.

1.  On the **Edit expense report** page, on the **Expense lines** FastTab, click **Other** \> **Return cash advances**.

2.  Select the category for the returned cash advance, and then on the **Action Pane**, select **Add to summary**.

3.  Select the line for the returned cash advance, and then on the **Expense lines** FastTab, click **Edit**.

4.  Enter the cash advance amount that you want to return, and then click **Save and close**.

## Add guests

When you enter entertainment or meal expenses on an expense report, you may have to enter expenses for other people. For example, you may take a potential client to dinner. When you enter the meal expense on your expense report, you can also list your guest.

1.  On the **Edit expense report** page, select the expense to which you want to add guests, and then depending on the version of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 you are using, do one of the following:.
    
      - In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2: Click **Other** \> **Persons entertained**.
    
      - In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3: Click **Other** \> **Guests**.

2.  Select whether the guest is internal to your organization, a personal guest, or a contact that is external to your organization.

3.  Select the name of the guest, and then enter the guest's company or organization and title.

4.  Repeat steps 1 through 3 for each guest that you want to add to the expense line.

5.  Click **Save and close**.
