Sometimes, your customers want more than one quotation for the items that they are interested in. Typically, they want items in a range of prices. In these situations, you can send several alternative quotations and link them. Each quotation might reflect different materials (for example, steel, copper, or aluminum) or different finishes (for example, brushed, polished, or matte).

**Example**

Your customer wants a quotation for a lamp, but he is not completely certain what he wants. Therefore, you offer him three options:

  - A steel base with a polished steel shade

  - A copper base with a brushed copper shade

  - An aluminum base with a matte aluminum shade

You send the customer three quotations. These quotations are linked in such a way that acceptance of one of them causes the loss of the other two.

The following topics provide information about how to record alternative quotations.
