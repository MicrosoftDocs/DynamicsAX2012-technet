# Create or modify service orders and repair lines 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can create a service order and its service repair lines at the same time by using the Service Order Wizard. Alternatively, you can create a service order that does not include repair lines by using the **Create service order** page. You also use the **New service order line** page to add service order lines to a service order, and the **Edit service order** page to change an existing service order.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Before you can add repair lines to a service order, the service object relation must be set up in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client. For information about service object relations, see <A href="view-service-object-relations.md">View service object relations</A>.</P>
