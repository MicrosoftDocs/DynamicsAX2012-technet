# Fixed asset additions report (AssetAddition) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use this report to print a list of fixed assets and their additions, based on the fixed assets in the **Fixed assets** form and the additions in the **Fixed asset additions** form.

An addition is a modification to a fixed asset, or an add-on item for a fixed asset. An addition is considered part of the asset, but is not a separate asset. For example, an extra battery for a laptop is an addition to the laptop fixed asset. Typically, an addition is maintenance for the asset or an improvement, and is related to a write-up adjustment.
