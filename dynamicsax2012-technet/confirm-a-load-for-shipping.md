# Confirm a load for shipping 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic applies to features in the <STRONG>Transportation management</STRONG> module. It does not apply to features in the <A href="inventory-management.md">Inventory management</A> module.</P>



This topic explains how to confirm a load for shipping. When an outbound load is confirmed, you can generate shipping documents, such as a packing slip or bill of lading to be shipped with the load. When an inbound load is confirmed, you can define a packing structure that specifies how the load should be packed. After the packing structure is defined, you can confirm the inbound load.

## This task is part of a bigger process

Confirming a load is part of the inbound or outbound processes in a warehouse. For more information, see [Business process: Planning transportation for inbound loads](business-process-planning-transportation-for-inbound-loads.md) or [Business process: Planning and processing outbound loads for shipping](business-process-planning-and-processing-outbound-loads-for-shipping.md).
