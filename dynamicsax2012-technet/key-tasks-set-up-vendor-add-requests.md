# Key tasks: Set up vendor add requests 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Employees can submit requests to add a vendor to the vendor master for their legal entity. Employees may want to add a new vendor if, for example, they want to purchase a product that is not offered by a vendor in the companyâ€™s current vendor master. New vendor requests are submitted in the Employee services portal in Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Only users who are assigned the Employee role in Microsoft Dynamics AX can submit a new vendor request in the Employee services portal.</P>



Before an employee can submit a request to add a new vendor, the **New vendor request** page must be set up in Enterprise Portal. An administrator sets up the page by using the **Vendor request configurations** form in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client.

When an employee submits a new vendor request, the request is routed to an approver through workflow. If the request is approved, the prospective vendor is invited to submit a full profile on the **Vendor registration** page.

Before vendors can complete the registration process, the **Vendor registration** page must be set up in Enterprise Portal. An administrator sets up the page by using the **Vendor request configurations** form in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client.

## Configure the New vendor request page for Enterprise Portal

You define the fields that are displayed and required on the **New vendor request** page in Enterprise Portal by using the **Vendor request configurations** form in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client. You also use this form to set up other system checks for new vendor requests.

You use the **Vendor add request** request type to set up the **Vendor registration** page. You can create multiple profiles for this request type. This allows you create different profiles for different companies.

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Setup** \> **Vendors** \> **Vendor request configurations**.

2.  In the **Vendor request configurations** form, in the **Request type** field, select **Vendor add request**.

3.  On the **Fields** FastTab, indicate whether each business justification field that appears in the list should be displayed, hidden, or required on the **New vendor request** page. If you want the requester to specify a procurement category, select the **Require procurement category** check box.

4.  On the **Companies** FastTab, select the companies to which the profile applies.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The default profile applies to all companies that do not have a defined profile. Specific companies cannot be selected for this profile.</P>



5.  If you want to display specific text on the vendor add request, on the **Content** FastTab, select the **Select to display defined text** check box. Enter the text in the **General text** box. For example, this text might contain information about terms, processes, or corporate policies.

6.  On the **System checks** FastTab, select the system checks that should be performed on new vendor requests. For example, the system can flag new vendor requests that reference a vendor that is located in a country or region that is embargoed.

7.  On the **Questionnaires** FastTab, select one or more questionnaires that you want employees to complete during the request process. You can specify different questionnaires for each profile.

## Configure the Vendor registration page for Enterprise Portal

You use the **Vendor add application** request type to set up the **Vendor registration** page. Prospective vendors use this page when they respond to a vendor registration solicitation. You can create multiple profiles for the **Vendor add application** request type. This allows you create different profiles for different countries/regions. For example, in a profile for France, you might require the vendor to provide their French Siret number.

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Setup** \> **Vendors** \> **Vendor request configurations**.

2.  In the **Vendor request configurations** form, in the **Request type** field, select **Vendor add application**.

3.  Click **New**.
    

    > [!WARNING]
    > <P>If you do not click <STRONG>New</STRONG>, the changes that you make will affect the default profile.</P>



4.  On the **Fields** FastTab, indicate whether each business information field that appears in the list should be displayed, hidden, or required on the **Business information** FastTab on the **Vendor registration** page.
    
    If you do not want to display the **Business information** tab on the **Vendor registration** page, select the **Hide Business information FastTab** check box.

5.  On the **Countries/regions** FastTab, select the countries/regions to which the profile applies.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <UL>
    > <LI>
    > <P>The country/region that is identified in the primary address for the vendor is used to determine which vendor registration profile to display on the <STRONG>Vendor registration</STRONG> page.</P>
    > <LI>
    > <P>The default profile applies to all countries/regions that do not have a defined profile. Specific countries/regions cannot be selected for this profile.</P></LI></UL>



6.  If you want to display specific text on the **Vendor registration** page, on the **Content** FastTab, select the **Select to display defined text** check box. Enter the text in the **General text** box. For example, this text might contain privacy and disclosure information that the vendor must acknowledge before submitting the registration.

7.  On the **System checks** FastTab, select the system checks that should be performed on vendor registrations. For example, the system can flag vendor a registration that is submitted by a vendor who is located in a country or region that is embargoed.

8.  On the **Questionnaires** FastTab, select one or more questionnaires that you want vendors to complete during the request process. You can specify different questionnaires for each profile.
