# Test products and quality management overview

Quality assurance involves product testing and managing nonconforming material.

Product testing is typically referred to as quality control and involves the use of quality orders. By using the quality-control functionality, you can do the following:

  - Predefine the tests that must be performed for material. These include the quality specifications, applicable test instrument, documents that describe the test, sampling plan, and acceptable quality levels (AQL).

  - Create a quality order that identifies the tests that are to be performed for a specific order, such as a purchase or production order, or for a specific inventory quantity. You can create a quality order manually or generate a quality order automatically, based on quality guidelines.

  - Define the quality guidelines that relate to purchase, quarantine, production orders, or sales orders in each business process, for the automatic generation of a quality order that identifies the testing requirements for incoming or outgoing material.

  - Record the test results for tests in a quality order, validate the test results against the AQL, and print a certificate of analysis that displays the test results.

Managing nonconforming material is typically referred to as quality management and involves the use of nonconformance orders, which are termed nonconformances. By using the quality-management functionality, you can do the following:

  - Create a nonconformance order that describes a quantity of nonconforming material, with regard to the problem source, problem type, and explanatory notes. You can predefine a classification of problem types to facilitate the analysis of nonconforming material.

  - Print a nonconformance tag and nonconformance report to guide the disposition of nonconforming material, such as indicating a condition of unusable or restricted usage.

  - Create one or more corrective actions that identify the diagnostic action that is to be performed on nonconforming material, the person who should perform the diagnostic, and the requested and planned completion dates.

  - Estimate the work and costs that are associated with a nonconformance, with regard to the required material, labor, and miscellaneous charges.

  - Create a quality order for the nonconforming material that identifies the tests that are to be performed and the test results.

  - Link one nonconformance order to another, to reflect the interconnection between quality problems.
