# Add images and colors to process flow maps [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can add images to represent processes in a process flow map. You can also use colors to represent specific substances and substance categories that are included in process flow maps. For example, you add an image of a light bulb to the process that represents your electricity utility. Additionally, you use the color yellow to represent the electricity as it travels to the different processes in your organization.

The following procedures explain how to add images to represent a process, and how to select a color to represent a substance or substance category in process flow maps.

## Represent a process by using an image

1.  Click **Compliance and internal controls** \> **Common** \> **Environmental sustainability** \> **Environmental processes** \> **Environmental processes**.

2.  Select the process to add an image to, or click **New** to create a new process.

3.  On the **Image** tab, click **Add image**.

4.  Select an image to represent the selected process, and then click **Open**.
    
    The image is used to represent the process.
