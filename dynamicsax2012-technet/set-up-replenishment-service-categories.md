# Set up replenishment service categories 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

You must set up a service category if you want to use replenishment rules to cross-dock (distribute by using a planned purchase order). The service category is linked to the vendor on the **Retail** FastTab in the **Vendors** form.

The service category can be set up to provide information about the availability of goods that are for sale and the delivery time. The service category also supports automatic and manual cross-docking.

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Replenishment** \> **Service categories**.

2.  In the **Service category** form, select a service category, or click **New** to create a new service category.

3.  In the **Service category** field, type an ID number. Then, in the **Description** field, type a description.

4.  Enter additional information about delivery dates, replenishment rules, or cross-docking warehouses. For more information, see [Service categories (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh597287\(v=ax.60\)).
