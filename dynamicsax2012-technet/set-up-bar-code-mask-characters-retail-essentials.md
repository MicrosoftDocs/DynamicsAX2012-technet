# Set up bar code mask characters (Retail essentials) 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to set up characters for bar code masks. These alphabetical characters are replaced with numbers when Retail essentials uses a bar code mask to generate a bar code. A single mask character can add several characters to a bar code; for example, a mask character can represent an item number that contains multiple characters.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you create bar codes manually, you do not have to set up mask characters or masks. However, if you create a bar code manually for a product, and a bar code mask has been set up for that product, mask validation is performed only on the check digit.</P>



To set up mask characters for bar codes, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Retail essentials** \> **Inventory management** \> **Setup** \> **Bar codes and labels** \> **Mask characters**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a new bar code mask character.

3.  In the **Type** field, select the type of mask character. Then, in the **Character** field, type a letter between A and Z.

4.  In the **Description** field, type a description of the mask character.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Retail essentials, the form that you use to complete this task includes a subset of the controls that are available for other configurations of Retail. If a topic about this form describes controls that you don't see, it may be because you’re using Retail essentials.</P>
