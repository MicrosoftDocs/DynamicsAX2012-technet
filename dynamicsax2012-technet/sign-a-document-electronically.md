# Sign a document electronically 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Before you can sign documents electronically, the Microsoft Dynamics AX administrator must grant you the appropriate permissions. See [Set up users to sign documents electronically](set-up-users-to-sign-documents-electronically.md) for more information.

When you have the correct permissions, you must request a certificate and set a password. For more information, see [Certificates for electronic signatures](certificates-for-electronic-signatures.md).

If a change to a document requires a signature and one is not provided, signing will fail and the change will not be saved.

## Signing a document electronically

1.  The **Sign document** form is displayed when you make a change that requires an electronic signature.
    
    If you have the required permissions to sign the document, follow the remaining steps in this procedure. If another user signs for your changes, then that person must complete the steps in this procedure.

2.  Click the **Document** tab to review the changes to the document.

3.  On the **Signature** tab, select a reason code.

4.  Enter a comment, if necessary.

5.  If your user ID is not displayed in the **Signer** field, select it from the list.

6.  Enter your location, if necessary.

7.  Click **OK**.
