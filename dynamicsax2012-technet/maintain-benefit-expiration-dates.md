# Maintain benefit expiration dates 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Mass benefit expiration allows you to change the expiration date of a benefit and of the enrollments of workers enrolled in that benefit at the same time. You can also select multiple workers who are enrolled in a benefit and change the ending date of their coverage. Depending on your version of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, the date when a worker’s coverage in a benefit expires may be called the enrollment end date or the coverage end date.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic does not apply to versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 prior to cumulative update 6 for AX 2012.</P>



Mass benefit expiration is available only when you select a single benefit that is active or that becomes active in the future. It is not available for tax levies or garnishments.


> [!TIP]
> <P>If the time zone that is set for the legal entity differs from the time zone where the benefit was created, the mass benefit expiration process might result in some dates being off by one calendar day. If this occurs, you can adjust the dates by running the process again.</P>



## Expire a benefit and end benefit coverage for all affected workers at the same time

When you change the expiration date of a benefit to an earlier date, all worker enrollments that end after the new date are changed so that they expire on the earlier date. Any worker enrollments that end before the new benefit expiration date are not affected. Any worker enrollments that are scheduled to begin after the new benefit expiration date are deleted.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>To expire a benefit that has no enrolled workers, use the <STRONG>Maintain versions</STRONG> form. For more information, see <A href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh227640(v=ax.60)">Maintain benefit versions (form)</A>.</P>



1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Common** \> **Benefits** \> **Benefits**.

2.  Select a benefit, and then click **Mass benefit expiration**.

3.  In the **Update option** field, select **Expire the benefit and affected worker enrollments**.

4.  In the **New benefit expiration date** field, enter the date when the benefit will expire.

5.  Click **Expire**.
    
    The expiration date of the benefit and the coverage ending date for all affected workers are changed to the new benefit expiration date.

6.  When the process is complete, review the **Mass benefit expiration results** form to verify that all changes have been made. The results can be exported to Microsoft Excel for future reference or analysis.

## Extend a benefit and benefit coverage for multiple workers at the same time
