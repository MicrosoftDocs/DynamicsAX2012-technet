# Assign target completion dates to question groups in RapidStart Services 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Beginning October 1, 2015, RapidStart services will no longer be supported. For more information, see the announcement on CustomerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/northamerica/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued or PartnerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/news-events/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued.

As the Customer administrator for a configuration project in Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services, you can use this procedure to assign a target completion date to each group of questions in your configuration project. Target completion dates can help keep the work of answering questions on schedule.

  - The business experts know when they are expected to complete their work.

  - When you review progress reports for the project, you can see whether the business experts are on schedule to complete their work.

The target completion dates that you assign are based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), not a local system time.
