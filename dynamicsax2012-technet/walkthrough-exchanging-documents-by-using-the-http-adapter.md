# Walkthrough: Exchanging documents by using the HTTP adapter 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The HTTP adapter enables synchronous communication through a website. This walkthrough demonstrates how to use an inbound integration port together with the HTTP adapter to read a sales order from Microsoft Dynamics AX. In this walkthrough, you create an inbound integration port, and then use C\# code to create a command-line program that reads a specific sales order.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This walkthrough does not demonstrate how to work with security settings, such as those that restrict an exchange to a particular company or partition. For more information about security settings, see <A href="configure-security-for-integration-ports.md">Configure security for integration ports</A>.</P>



## Prerequisites

  - You must install web services on Internet Information Services (IIS) and verify that the default website is working. See [Install web services on IIS](install-web-services-on-iis.md).

  - Microsoft Dynamics AX must contain at least one valid sales order.

  - The sales order service must be registered. For information about how to register services, see [Customize service contracts](customize-service-contracts.md).

  - Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 must be installed, and you must know how to create a simple Visual C\# project.

## Create and configure the integration port

When you create an integration port that uses the HTTP adapter, Application Integration Framework (AIF) publishes a Web Services Description Language (WSDL) document and related files to the website that you specify.

1.  Open the **Inbound ports** form. Click **System administration** \> **Setup** \> **Services and Application Integration Framework** \> **Inbound ports**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Name the new integration port **WebSalesOrderRead**.

4.  In the **Address** group, in the **Adapter** list, select **HTTP**.

5.  In the **URI** field, click the arrow. The **Select Web site** form opens.

6.  In the **Select Web site** form, in the **Web site** field, select the default website in the list. Then close the form.

7.  On the **Service contract customizations** FastTab, click **Service operations**.

8.  In the **Select service operations** form, in the **Remaining service operations** list, select **SalesSalesOrderService.read**. Click the left arrow button to move the service operation to the **Selected service operations** list. Then close the form.

9.  You can modify the document's data policy to match the fields that you want to return in the response. If you do not specify a data policy, AIF includes all elements from the sales order's schema in the response message. If you specify a data policy but do not modify the default data policy, only the default elements are included in the sales order's schema.

10. Activate the integration port.

11. Make note of the address that is displayed in the **WSDL URI** field.

12. Close the **Inbound ports** form.

## Create a HTTP client application

This section describes how to create a simple client application that synchronously exchanges messages with the HTTP integration port. The code for the client application is written in the C\# programming language. The sample application reads a sales order from Microsoft Dynamics AX, and then displays the sales order ID and the customer account number.

1.  Open Visual Studio, and create a new console application project in Visual C\#. Name the project **HTTP Client**.

2.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project name, and then click **Add Service Reference**.
    
    The **Add Service Reference** dialog box opens.

3.  In the **Address** box, enter the WSDL URI from the port that you created in the previous section. For example, the URI may be http://MyServer/MicrosoftDynamicsAXAif60/WebSalesOrderRead/xppservice.svc.

4.  Click **Go**. Wait for Visual Studio to find the service.

5.  Click **OK** to close the dialog box.

6.  Open Program.cs. In the code editor, replace the empty Main function with the following C\# code.
    
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Create the sales order objects
            // Service client
            ServiceReference1.SalesOrderServiceClient cl = new ServiceReference1.SalesOrderServiceClient();
            // Sales order object to receive response
            HTTP_Client.ServiceReference1.AxdSalesOrder resp;
        
            // Create the entity key list for the request
            ServiceReference1.EntityKey[] readRespKeys = new ServiceReference1.EntityKey[1];
            readRespKeys[0] = new ServiceReference1.EntityKey();
            readRespKeys[0].KeyData = new ServiceReference1.KeyField[1];
            readRespKeys[0].KeyData[0] = new ServiceReference1.KeyField();
            readRespKeys[0].KeyData[0].Field = "SalesId";
        
            // Ask the user for a sales order ID
            Console.WriteLine("Enter the sales order ID:");
            // Add the result to the entity key value
            readRespKeys[0].KeyData[0].Value = Console.ReadLine();
        
            try
            {
                // Try to read the sales order
                resp = cl.read(null, readRespKeys);
        
                // Display the information from the first sales table
                Console.WriteLine("For sales order: " + resp.SalesTable[0].SalesId);
                Console.WriteLine("Customer Account is: " + resp.SalesTable[0].CustAccount);
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Exception: " + e.Message);
                cl.Abort();
            }
            cl.Close();
        }

7.  Build the project.

## Read a sales order

To read a sales order, run the client application.

1.  In Windows, open a Command Prompt window.

2.  At the command prompt, run the HTTP client application.

3.  When you are prompted by the application, enter a valid sales order ID.

If the sales order is successfully read, the application displays the sales order ID and the customer account number. Otherwise, the application displays an exception message.
