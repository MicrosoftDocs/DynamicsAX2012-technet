# (HUN) Set up a value model for low-cost assets 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

A low-cost asset is an asset for which the acquisition cost does not exceed a predefined amount. Hungarian tax law defines the limit for low-cost assets. These assets can be fully depreciated immediately. Use this procedure to create a value model for low-cost assets. When you create an acquisition transaction for an asset that uses the value model for low-cost assets, depreciation is generated automatically.

1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Setup** \> **Value models**.

2.  In the **Value model** field, select the value model for low-cost assets. If a value model for low-cost assets does not already exist, click **New**, and then enter a name and description for the new value model for low-cost assets.

3.  Enter any additional values, and then, on the **General** FastTab, select the **Low-cost asset** check box.
