# (RUS) Set up employee compensation parameters 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

This topic describes about how to set up types of incapacities and injuries, the scale of charges, and pay frequencies for employee compensation payments.

The work compensation parameters are necessary to determine the payment that an employee receives when the employee performs their duties. The level of compensation can be defined by scale of charges while the pay frequency defines the frequency of making payments.

The work incapacity compensation parameters are necessary to determine the amount of pay that an employee receives when the employee is unable to work because of certain types of incapacities that are covered by social insurance fund and the wage fund. When employees are absent, they receive social insurance payments.

## 1\. Set up types of work incapacities and injuries

You can set up certain work incapacities to refer to if an employee is temporarily unable to work. You can use the **Sick lists** form to register a sick list that defines the temporary work incapacity. An employee may temporarily be unable to work because of various incapacities related to child care, illness of the employee, illness of dependents, or occupational diseases. In these cases, the company makes contributions to the social insurance fund on behalf of the employee. These contributions or insurance fees are used by the employee when the employee is unable to work.

An employee can also be absent because of child rearing leave. An employee cannot be compensated for more than 100 percent of the average earnings per month for this incapacity. Employees who work in unfavorable conditions are compensated by the government for a longer duration with more compensation and increased minimum average earnings than regular employees. Also, the employees must have a minimum average earning that is defined by the government.

To set up the types of work incapacities, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Calculation procedures** \> **Sick lists** \> **Setup** \> **General settings**.

2.  On the **General** tab, select details for compensation calculations.
    
    Use the information in the following table to select the compensation parameters.

3.  On the **Types of work incapacity** tab, select one of the following types of incapacity:
    
      - **Illness**
    
      - **Care of sick**
    
      - **Maternity leave**
    
      - **Injury**
    
      - **Treatment in sanatoria and health resorts**
    
      - **Child rearing leave**
    
      - **Child care (out-patient treatment)**
    
      - **Child care (hospitalization)**
    
      - **Child care for child with disability**
    
      - **Child care without restriction of duration**
    
      - **Professional injury**
    
      - **Occupational disease**

4.  In the **Sequence** field, enter the sequence code that refers to the configured counters. The configured counter rules are defined for sick list calculation and payroll transactions creation for the selected type of incapacity.

5.  Select the **Additional payment from Wage Fund** check box to accrue extra pay for the sick lists from the wage fund. This extra pay is paid to the employee to compensate the reduced pay from the social fund that is calculated on the regular average earning.
    
    For example, if an employee is sick, the employee compensation can be calculated based on the average earnings. The employee receives 80 percent of the average earnings guaranteed by law and the company pays the remaining 20 percent as a compensation for work at home during the illness.

6.  In the **Unpaid days** field, select the rate code that corresponds to the number of days at the beginning of the work incapacity that is compensated from the wage fund and not from the social fund.

7.  In the **Benefit limitation** field group, in the **Apply the amount's limitation** field, select the rate code. The rate code that you select must have the **Value** field set to **Yes** in the **Rates** form.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can select the rate code in the <STRONG>Monthly amount limitation</STRONG>, <STRONG>Yearly amount limitation</STRONG>, <STRONG>Daily average earning's amount limitation</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Hourly average earning's amount limitation</STRONG> fields to define rules of limitation based on the prior period’s revenue by using the average earnings calculation.</P>



8.  In the **Apply the seniority's limitation** field, select the rate code. The rate code that you select must have the **Value** field set to **Yes** in the **Rates** form.

9.  In the **Minimal seniority for MROT** field, select the rate code for limitations that are applied to the employee at the start of the employment. The employee is paid only a fixed percentage of the social insurance at the start of the employment. The rate code value in this field is available based on the rate code values that you select in the **Apply the seniority's limitation** field.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The selected rate code applies to the employee’s seniority in months and if the calculated value is positive, you can use the rate value as the percentage of the average earning calculation and the allowance is calculated based on MROT value.</P>



10. In the **Seniority limitation** field, select the rate code for the maximum allowance on the average earning that depends on the seniority. The rate code in this field applies to the employee's seniority in years.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The calculated value is used as the percentage of the average earning calculation and the allowance is calculated based on average earning calculated from prior earnings.</P>



11. In the **Seniority limitation for dismissal employees** field, select the rate code for the maximum allowance on the average earnings of an employee after the dismissal of the employee. The rate code in this field applies to the number of days after the employee's dismissal date.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If the calculated value is positive, you can use the rate code as the percentage of the average earning to be paid as the allowance. This percentage overrides the value that is defined in <STRONG>Minimal seniority for MROT</STRONG> or <STRONG>Seniority limitation</STRONG> fields.</P>



12. In the **Limitation by days** field, select the rate code to specify limitations for the number of days for which the child-related benefit is calculated. This rate code applies to the selected child's age in years that you set up in the **Relatives** form.

## 3\. Creating types of contracts

Companies hire employee based on rules that are regulated by the labor codes or civil codes. The employees who are hired according to the labor contract laws are additionally classified as **Permanent**, **Temporary**, **On a specific term**, or **Seasonal** types of workers. These types of workers are hired according to the labor agreement. Civil contract workers are not hired permanently by the company, and their work period is for the time period that is specified in the agreement.
