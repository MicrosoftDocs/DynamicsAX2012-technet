# (ESP) Intra-Community VAT 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Intra-Community VAT information can be calculated and posted automatically. When an EU vendor invoice is posted, two VAT transactions are created with the same invoice amount – one for sales tax payable and one for sales tax receivable.

Select the **EU sales tax for Spanish invoices** check box in the **Accounts payable parameters** form to use the Intra-Community VAT feature.
