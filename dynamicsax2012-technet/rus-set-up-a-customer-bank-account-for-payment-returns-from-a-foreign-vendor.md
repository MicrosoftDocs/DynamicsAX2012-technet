2.  Select a customer account, and then click **Set up** \> **Bank accounts** to open the **Customer bank accounts** form.

3.  Create a bank account for the customer to receive payment returns from a foreign vendor.

4.  Click the **General** tab.

5.  In the **Foreign bank** field group, in the **Bank name** field, select the code of the foreign bank with which the customer bank account is registered.
