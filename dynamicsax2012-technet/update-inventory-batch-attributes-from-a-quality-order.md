# Update inventory batch attributes from a quality order 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use this procedure to update one or multiple inventory batch attributes. The updated attribute values are taken from test results that are shown in a quality order.


> [!TIP]

1.  Click **Inventory management** \> **Periodic** \> **Quality management** \> **Quality orders**.

2.  Select the quality order that is associated with the inventory batch to update.

3.  Click **Inquiries** and select **Associated inventory batches**.

4.  Select the inventory batch number to update.

5.  Click **Functions** and select **Update batch attributes**.
