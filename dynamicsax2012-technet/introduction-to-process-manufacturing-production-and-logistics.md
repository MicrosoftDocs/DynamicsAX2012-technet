# Introduction to Process manufacturing production and logistics 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Process Manufacturing Production and Logistics provides integrated functionality for planning and managing production and distribution for enterprises engaged in processing of goods. It supports a variety of manufacturing processes that includes make to order, make to stock, or a hybrid environment with both process and discrete manufacturing operations.

Process Manufacturing Production and Logistics provides chemical manufacturers with tools that help them to control and maximize assets, minimize operating costs, and monitor the impact of decisions on orders, production, inventory, and distribution. It offers process and hybrid manufacturers solutions that address production and distribution. It also provides them with integrated functionality for planning and managing production, distribution, procurement, and accounting.

  - Formula management

  - Co-product and by-product planning and management, including allocating costs for unplanned co-products and by-products

  - Multi-dimensional inventory capability

  - Containerized packaging

  - Full visibility and partial visibility catch weight management

  - Batch attribute assignment, search, and reserve capability

  - Inventory batch management

  - First expired/first out (FEFO) and shelf life inventory management with the ability to set vendor-specific batch information

  - Commodity pricing management

  - Rebate and trade promotion management

  - Approved vendor set up and maintenance

  - Vendor batch detail set up and maintenance

  - Potency management

  - Batch balancing for potency formulas
