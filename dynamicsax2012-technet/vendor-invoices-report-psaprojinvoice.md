# Vendor invoices report (PSAProjInvoice) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use the **Vendor invoices** report to view a summary of all vendor invoices for a vendor, project, or project contract that have a pay-when-paid setting.

## How to filter the data on this report

When you generate this report, the following default parameters are displayed. You can use these parameters to filter the data that will be displayed on the report. For more information, see [Filter the data on a report](filter-the-data-on-a-report.md).

In the **Customer payment retention summary** field, select whether you want to organize the report information by vendor or by project. The combination of filters that you select determines what is displayed on the report. For example, if you select **Vendor**, vendor invoice totals by vendor are displayed. If there are no vendor payment retention amounts that meet the selection criteria that you select, the report is empty.
