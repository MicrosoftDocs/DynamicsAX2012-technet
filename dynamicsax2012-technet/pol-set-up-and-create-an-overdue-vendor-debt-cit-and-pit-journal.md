# (POL) Set up and create an overdue vendor debt CIT and PIT journal 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can set up the parameters that are used to identify the transactions that are included in the overdue vendor debt Corporate Income Tax (CIT) and Personal Income Tax (PIT) journal. You can then create an overdue vendor debt CIT and PIT journal for a period that you specify. The journal contains the following information:

  - A list of overdue payments that require tax cost adjustments. You can manually adjust tax costs for these payments.

  - A list of payments that were overdue, for which tax cost was adjusted previously, and you made the payments to the vendors. You can reverse the tax cost adjustments for these payments.

You can exclude debts from the list of overdue payments. You can generate the Overdue CIT and PIT journal report that contains the details about the overdue payments and tax cost adjustments.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic does not apply to versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 prior to cumulative update 7 for AX 2012 R2.</P>

## 1\. Set up parameters for overdue vendor debt CIT and PIT journals

Use the **Overdue debt journal calculation setup** form to set up parameters that are used to identify transactions for overdue vendor debt CIT and PIT journals.

To perform this task, follow these steps:

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **Overdue debt** \> **Overdue debt journal calculation**.

2.  Click **New** or press CTRL+N to create a record.

3.  In the **Journal type** field, select **Vendor CIT and PIT journal** as the type of journal that uses this calculation setup.

4.  In the **Minimum number of days** field, enter the minimum number of days past the due date after which the transactions are included in the overdue vendor debt CIT and PIT journal.

5.  In the **Maximum number of days** field, enter the maximum number of days past the due date before which the transactions are included in the overdue vendor debt CIT and PIT journal.

6.  In the **Calculation type** field, select a method that is used to identify the transactions.
    
    Select from the following options:
    
      - **Due date** – The transactions are identified using the payment due date.

If this check box is selected and an invoice is included in an existing overdue vendor debt CIT and PIT journal, then you cannot settle or unsettle the invoice with a payment.
