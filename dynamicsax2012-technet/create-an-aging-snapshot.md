Create aging snapshot records for all customers or for the customers in a customer pool. Aging snapshot information is shown on the **Collections** list page and in the **Collections** form. You must create an aging snapshot before you can use the list page. The list page shows information only for customers for whom an aging snapshot has been created. For more information, see [Customer aging snapshot (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh242719\(v=ax.60\)).

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Periodic** \> **Collections** \> **Customer aging snapshot**.

2.  Select an aging period definition.

3.  Optional: Select a pool. For information about how to set up a customer pool, see [Set up collections](set-up-collections.md).

4.  Select the type of date in the transaction records to use to assign transactions to aging periods.

5.  Select a date to base the aging snapshot calculations on.

    > <P>If the aging snapshot process will run as part of a batch, select <STRONG>Today's date</STRONG> in the <STRONG>Aging as of</STRONG> field. Otherwise, the aging snapshot is always created for the same date.</P>
