# Learn about extending the capabilities of Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Beginning October 1, 2015, RapidStart services will no longer be supported. For more information, see the announcement on CustomerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/northamerica/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued or PartnerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/news-events/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued.

Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services lets you prepare an implementation of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 by answering a series of questions in an interview-style, questionnaire-based format. After all the question groups for the implementation have been marked as completed, you can load the configuration into your Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 implementation.

As the RapidStart Services Designer for an organization, you can use the **Design** area to create questions, question groups, and functional areas. In this way, you can supplement the questions, question groups, and functional areas that are provided in the RapidStart Services tool by Microsoft. For example, you can create new questions or new functional areas to support the setup of financials for a locale that is not already supported by RapidStart Services.

You add the functional areas that you create to a custom template. This template is then available in the **Configure** area of RapidStart Services when a Customer administrator for your organization creates a new configuration project.

You can also create questions and question groups to support the configuration of parameters in a solution that is developed by a partner. Before you can create questions that are based on partner-developed solutions, the Customer administrator for your organization must import the required metadata from a target implementation of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. Before you can create questions that are based on partner-developed solutions, the Customer administrator for your organization must import the required metadata from a target implementation of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012.

Custom questions that you create for your organization are available only in your RapidStart Services tenant. They cannot be accessed by other organizations.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>For new questions or modifications to questions that are based on standard Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 functionality, you do not need to import metadata from your implementation of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012.</P>



For information about how to import metadata, see [Import metadata into Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services from a Microsoft Dynamics ERP implementation](import-metadata-into-microsoft-dynamics-erp-rapidstart-services-from-a-microsoft-dynamics-erp-implementation.md).
