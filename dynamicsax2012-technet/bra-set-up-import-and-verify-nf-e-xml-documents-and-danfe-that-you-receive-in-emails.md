## 1\. Set up email accounts to import XML files and DANFE for NF-e

Use the **Email accounts** form to set up email accounts that are used to import XML documents and DANFE for NF-e.

To perform this task, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Brazil** \> **Configure email accounts**.

2.  In the **Email accounts** form, click **New** or press CTRL+N to create a new record, and then specify the server address, port, user name, and password for the email account.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">

    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


3.  Repeat step 2 to set up additional email accounts.

## 2\. Set up the IBGE code for a state, and then assign the state to an NF-e authority

Use the **Address setup** form to set up the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica (IBGE) code for a state, and then use the **NF-e federal parameters** form to assign the state to an NF-e authority.

To perform this task, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Addresses** \> **Address setup**.

2.  Click **State/province**, and then in the **State/province** area, select or create a state record. For more information, see “Set up state/province information” in [Key tasks: Set up address formats](key-tasks-set-up-address-formats.md).

3.  In the **IBGE code** field, enter the IBGE code for the state, and then close the form.

4.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Brazil** \> **NF-e federal parameters**.

5.  Select or create an NF-e authority record. For more information, see “Set up web services for an NF-e” in [(BRA) Set up NF-e federal parameters](bra-set-up-nf-e-federal-parameters.md).

6.  In the lower pane, on the **States using authority** tab, in the **State** field, select a state for the NF-e authority. The description of the state is updated in the **Description** field.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can only select the states for which you specify the IBGE codes.</P>



## 3\. Import and verify the NF-e XML files and DANFE from emails

Use the **Import XML files from email** form to import the XML files and DANFE for NF-e from emails. You can then use the **Received NF-e XML documents** form to verify the XML document and DANFE for an NF-e and inquire about the current status of the NF-e at the Secretaria da Fazenda (SEFAZ) using the access key.

To import and verify the NF-e XML files and DANFE from emails, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Periodic** \> **NF-e Federal** \> **Import XML files from email**.

2.  Specify criteria, such as batch group and recurrence schedule, to import the XML files and DANFE.

3.  Click **OK** to import the files from emails.

4.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Periodic** \> **NF-e Federal** \> **Received NF-e xml documents**.

5.  In the **Received NF-e XML documents** form, verify the access key, fiscal establishment, series, number, Cadastro Nacional da Pessoa Jurídica (CNPJ), and name for the received NF-e XML document.

    <td><p>The IBGE code for the state where the NF-e is issued.</p></td>
    </tr>

    </tbody>
    </table>


6.  Select a line, and then on the **Action Pane**, click **XML document** to view the XML file for the NF-e. Close the form.

7.  In the **Received NF-e XML documents** form, select a line, and then on the **Action Pane**, click **DANFE** to view the DANFE for the NF-e. Close the form.

8.  In the **Received NF-e XML documents** form, select a line, and then click **Inquire status** to inquire about the current status of the NF-e at the SEFAZ using the access key. The status, date, and time of the inquiry are updated in the **Status from SEFAZ** and **Date and time of the last inquiry** fields.

You can click **XML document** and **DANFE** on the **Received NF-e federal** tab on the **Action Pane** in the **Fiscal document** form to view the XML document and DANFE for an NF-e. For more information about how to verify the posted fiscal documents, see [(BRA) Fiscal document (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj710548\(v=ax.60\)).

## 4\. Inquire about the status of NF-e access keys at the SEFAZ

Use the **Received XML Inquiry** form to set up Microsoft Dynamics AX to inquire about the status of NF-e access keys at the SEFAZ. Inquiries regarding the status of the NF-e are made multiple times before the NF-e is approved, and one additional inquiry is made about the status after the time that the vendor has to cancel an approved NF-e has elapsed.

To inquire about the status of NF-e access keys at the SEFAZ, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Periodic** \> **NF-e Federal** \> **Inquire about NF-e access key status**.

2.  In the **Limit of cancellation** field, enter the number of hours that the vendor has to cancel the NF-e.

3.  In the **Minimum inquiry interval** field, enter the minimum interval between the inquiries in minutes for the received NF-e access key at the SEFAZ.

4.  You can specify the additional batch processing criteria, such as batch group and recurrence schedule, on the **Batch** tab, and then click **OK**. For more information about batch processing, see [Batch processing overview](batch-processing-overview.md)

## 5\. Update access keys or XML documents for posted electronic fiscal documents

Use the **Posted NF-e with pending validation** form to view the posted electronic fiscal documents for which the access keys or XML documents are not available in the **Received NF-e XML documents** form. You can then update the access keys or XML documents for the electronic fiscal documents after posting.

To perform this task, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Periodic** \> **NF-e Federal** \> **Posted NF-e with pending validation**.

2.  In the **Posted NF-e with pending validation** form, select one of the following check boxes to filter the list of NF-e documents that are displayed in the form:
    
      - Select the **SEFAZ status not inquired** check box to view a list of NF-e documents for which the access keys are not validated by the SEFAZ. You can validate the access keys for these NF-e documents after posting.
    
      - Select the **Fiscal document status differs from SEFAZ status** check box to view a list of NF-e documents for which the status is updated from approved to canceled. You can cancel these NF-e documents and create and post the corrected NF-e documents. For more information, see [(BRA) Cancel a vendor NF-e](bra-cancel-a-vendor-nf-e.md), [(BRA) Post an NF-e from a purchase order](bra-post-an-nf-e-from-a-purchase-order.md), and [(BRA) Post an NF-e from a tax fiscal document](bra-post-an-nf-e-from-a-tax-fiscal-document.md).
    
      - Select the **NF-e documents that do not have XML attachments** check box to view a list of NF-e documents for which XML attachments are not available. You can import NF-e XML documents from an email for these NF-e documents after posting. For more information, see 3. Import and verify the NF-e XML files and DANFE from emails.
    
      - Select the **Access keys are not found in received NF-e XML documents** check box to view a list of NF-e documents for which the access keys are not available in received NF-e XML documents. You can enter the access keys for these NF-e documents manually in the **Received NF-e XML documents** form. For more information, see 3. Import and verify the NF-e XML files and DANFE from emails.
