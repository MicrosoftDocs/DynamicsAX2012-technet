# (RUS) Set up a register for the accounts receivable inventory act 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

The **Accounts receivable inventory act** register displays the accounts receivable balance at the start of the reporting period.

Accounts receivables are created on the basis of the unsettled invoices and advance payments that were made. All unsettled invoices are split into particular debt interval categories.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic has not been fully updated for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2.</P>



The exceeded term of debt settlement is determined from the difference between the date of the inventory and the invoice date, taking into account the payment terms.
