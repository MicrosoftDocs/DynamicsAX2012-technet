#### Property Value

Type: [System.Decimal](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/1k2e8atx\(v=ax.60\))  
Returns [Decimal](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/1k2e8atx\(v=ax.60\)).  

## Remarks

This is how much money the customer put into the purchase in form of a deposit.

It will match the required deposit if no deposit override was set and the order is created.

The difference between deposit and prepayment is: Deposit is the amount required for a customer order to be created / edited.

Prepayment is the amount the customer puts into the order to cover the deposit.

The prepayment covers the deposit, but during the CO's life cycle it will match the deposit amount only when the order is (ready to be) created / saved.
