# About system-generated quality orders 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When you set up a quality association, the system can generate quality orders for various business processes, events, and conditions. The quality association can cover a specific item, a specific group of items, or all items. Quality associations are created in the **Quality associations** form.

## Working with quality associations

The business process that uses a quality association can be related to purchase orders, sales orders, or production orders.


> [!TIP]
> <P>In the <STRONG>Quality associations</STRONG> form, the business process is referred to as the reference type.</P>



Each quality association record defines the set of tests, the acceptable quality level (AQL), and the sampling plan that applies to the quality orders that are generated. A quality association record must be defined for each variation in a business process. For example, you can set up a quality association that generates a quality order either before or after a packing slip is posted.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Inventory quantities that are specified in a quality order are automatically blocked from being issued.</P>



For a given business process, the quality association record identifies the event and the conditions for which a quality order is generated. The conditions can be specific either to a site or to a legal entity. A quality order that involves destructive tests can be generated only when on-hand inventory exists for the event.

The following examples illustrate how a quality association record is defined for the variations in each business process. For each example, the following diagram summarizes the events and conditions that are defined by a quality association record.

The following table provides more information about how quality orders can be generated for specific types of processes.
