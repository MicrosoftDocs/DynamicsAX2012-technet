# Relieve a general budget reservation (Public sector) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

After a general budget reservation has been posted, it is relieved by one of the source documents that reference it.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>General budget reservations are available only if the <STRONG>Public Sector</STRONG> configuration key is selected and if Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 Cumulative Update 8 is installed with the following hotfix: KB3047235</P>



There are three main ways to consume or relieve a general budget reservation:

  - **Purchase order** - Reference the general budget reservation directly on a purchase order line. The reservation is relieved, or consumed, when the purchase order is confirmed. No purchase agreement is involved. To do this, create a purchase order according to your usual process. This might also involve using a purchase requisition. When you add a line to the purchase order, select the general budget reservation to use for the purchase order.

  - **Vendor invoice** - Reference the general budget reservation directly on a vendor invoice. You can assign a purchase agreement on the header of the invoice, but no purchase order is involved. The reservation is relieved when the invoice is posted. To do this, create a vendor invoice according to your usual process. When you add a line to the invoice, select the general budget reservation to use for the invoice.

  - **Purchase requisition** â€“ Reference a general budget reservation line in a purchase requisition. The reservation is relieved when funds are released from the requisition. To do this, specify the purchase requisition on the budget reservation line when you create the reservation.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Purchase requisitions require workflow. For more information about creating a purchase requisition workflow, see <A href="overview-of-a-purchase-requisition-workflow.md">Overview of a purchase requisition workflow</A>. Also see <A href="set-up-general-budget-reservation-workflows-public-sector.md">Set up general budget reservation workflows (Public sector)</A>.</P>




> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can also reference a general budget reservation on a purchase agreement.</P>
> <P>After you post or confirm a document that references a general budget reservation, the budget reservation balance reflects the relieving amount. If you edit, cancel, or finalize the referencing document, the relieved amount shown is not reduced or removed; there is no way to return a relieved amount to the balance on the referencing document.</P>
