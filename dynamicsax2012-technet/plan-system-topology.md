# Plan system topology 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Plan your system topology carefully before deploying Microsoft Dynamics AX. Environments for development, testing, and production should be carefully optimized for throughput, response time, scalability, and availability. The following topics describe considerations in planning your system topology:

[AOS topology](aos-topology.md)

[SQL Server topology recommendations for availability and performance](sql-server-topology-recommendations-for-availability-and-performance.md)

[Application Integration Framework topology](application-integration-framework-topology.md)

[Project Server integration topology](project-server-integration-topology.md)

[Deployment topologies for Retail](deployment-topologies-for-retail.md)

[Sample deployment scenarios](sample-deployment-scenarios.md)


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This section describes network and system topologies, not how a Microsoft Dynamics AX system communicates internally. For information on internal Microsoft Dynamics AX architecture, see <A href="system-architecture.md">System architecture</A>.</P>




> [!IMPORTANT]
> <P>You need to make sure that your planned topology is supported by Microsoft. For more information, contact your value added reseller (VAR). If you are enrolled in a support plan directly with Microsoft, you can log on to <A href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92647">CustomerSource</A> and submit a new support request.</P>
