Use this report to view and print the details of the foreign currency revaluation that you are posting. The report shows:

  - The balances, in the original currency and the accounting currency, that correspond to the before and after revaluations for customers who have revalued transactions.

  - The revaluation amounts, by customer.

  - The sums of the revaluation transactions, by currency.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> <P>You can view and print this report only if you select the <STRONG>Print</STRONG> check box in the <STRONG>Foreign currency revaluation</STRONG> form immediately before you run the revaluation. The report is not saved in Microsoft Dynamics AX for later reference. You can always view the ledger and customer transactions that are created in a particular run of the revaluation.
