# Define Budgeting parameters and number sequences 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use the **Budget parameters** form to enable budget transfers, and to specify options for revenue budgets and subledger budget transfers. You can also select the budget journal for budget appropriations and set up number sequences for Budgeting.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic has been updated to include information about features that were added or changed in the following hotfix for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 Cumulative Update 8: KB3047235</P>



## In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 and earlier

Use the following steps to define budgeting parameters and number sequences in AX 2012 R3 and earlier versions.

1.  Click **Budgeting** \> **Setup** \> **Budgeting parameters**.

2.  Select a period allocation key for cash flow forecasts. The allocation key determines how the amount for a budget account entry is allocated in a cash flow forecast. For more information, see [Period allocation categories (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa582352\(v=ax.60\)).

3.  Select the **Use rules for budget transfers** check box to enable budget transfers.

4.  Select revenue budget options. You can allow or prevent updates if a budget register entry causes a revenue budget to go below 0 (zero). Alternatively, you can display warnings in this situation. You can also select a different time period for budget balances to aggregate for warnings or to prevent updates.

5.  Select whether to process budget register entries when they are transferred from project, fixed assets, demand forecast, or supply forecast budgets to general ledger budgets.

6.  If **Enable budget appropriation** is selected in the **General ledger parameters** form, select a budget journal to use for budget appropriations. This budget journal must have a journal type of **Budget** in the **Journal names** form. For more information, see [Journal names (form) (Project)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa617509\(v=ax.60\)).
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Before you can select <STRONG>Enable budget appropriation</STRONG>, you must select <STRONG>Use posting definitions</STRONG> in the <STRONG>General ledger parameters</STRONG> form. You must also create posting definitions and transaction posting definitions. Then, when you enter a budget register entry for an account or financial dimension combination that is used in the match criteria of the posting definition, a voucher is created in the general ledger for the generated entry from the posting definition. The generated entry uses the journal number from the selected budget journal.</P>



7.  Click **Number sequences**, and then select number sequence codes:
    
      - Select a code for the **Budget register entries** reference.
    
      - Select a code for the **Commitments** reference.
