# Maintaining quotations 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Quotations enable you to approach a prospect or a customer with a binding offer.

The quotation encompasses many elements such as the items and the services that are quoted, basic contact information, special trade agreements and discounts, and possible taxes and surcharges.

## Pipeline Management

Your ability to monitor, to review, and to control the pipeline of quotations and orders is an important part of customer relationship management. Various tools in Microsoft Dynamics AX can help with this task. Tools such as correct metadata definitions help you analyze the pipeline. These tools include quotation types, quotation origin, quotation prognosis, and quotation probability. You can use these tools to categorize the reasons why a quotation was won or lost, who the competitors were, and what the possible value of the quotation was.

You can view most of this data in various statistical outputs such as reports or management statistics in the **Sales and marketing** module.

## Location

You can create a quotation from **Sales and marketing** \> **Sales quotations**.
