2.  Select the component, expand the **BOM lines** FastTab, and then click **Add**.

3.  In the **Name** field, enter a name for the BOM line.

4.  In the **Description** field, enter a description of the BOM line.

5.  Save the BOM line, and then click **The item number associated with the sub-component.** to configure the BOM line.
