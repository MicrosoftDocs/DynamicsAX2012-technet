After you install the online store as described in this topic, you will be ready to customize the store you deployed. The process of customizing the Retail online store requires that you recompile the source code in the Visual Studio projects. After you recompile, the fully-qualified name of the rebuilt assemblies will be different than the assemblies originally provide by Microsoft. Before you can recompile the assemblies, you must provide a code signing key file (also called a strong name key file) to sign the customized code. If your business has a code signing key file (.snk file), you can reuse this file. If you do not have a code signing key file, Visual Studio can create one for you. You must create a new project and enable code signing. Then, create a second project that references the .dll of the output of the first project. You can locate the thumbprint in the assembly reference of the .csproj file in the second project. When you have the .snk file, you must do the following:

1.  Save the file in the Retail SDK folder and give it a name *Name*.snk.

2.  Edit the UpdateAssemblyIdentities.ps1 file in the Retail SDK folder. You must update the version number and the thumbprint of the key file (lines 97, 98).

3.  Update the source code to use the strong name certificate by executing the UpdateAssemblyIdentities.ps1 script. This script can take several minutes to complete.

Additional steps and recommendations for developers are described in the Next steps for developers section in this topic.

## Option 1: Install the Retail online store by using Setup

You can install the Retail online store by using Microsoft Dynamics AX Setup or by using Windows PowerShell scripts. If you prefer to install the Retail online store manually, see “Install the Retail online store by using Windows PowerShell” in this topic.

If you install other Microsoft Dynamics AX components at the same time, the installation pages vary, depending on the components that you are installing.

1.  Start Microsoft Dynamics AX Setup. Under **Install**, select **Microsoft Dynamics AX components**.

2.  Advance through the first wizard pages.

3.  If the Setup Support files have not yet been installed on this computer, the **Select a file location** page is displayed. The Setup Support files are required for installation. Provide a file location or accept the default location, and then click **Next**. On the **Ready to install** page, click **Install**.

4.  On the **Select installation type** page, click **Custom installation**, and then click **Next**.

5.  On the **Select components** page, select **Retail online channel**, and then click **Next**.

6.  On the **Prerequisite validation results** page, resolve any errors. For more information about how to resolve prerequisite errors, see [Check prerequisites](check-prerequisites.md). When no errors remain, click **Next**.

7.  On the **Configure a Microsoft Dynamics AX Retail online store** page, enter the following information about the web site where the online store will run.
    
      - On the **Configure the Retail online channel** page, select the check box to configure online store by using Setup. If you clear this option, the application files are installed, but the online store is not deployed or configured.
        
        If you’re configuring the online store, enter the following information:
    
      - **Storefront to deploy**: Select a Retail starter store to deploy. The Contoso starter store is modeled after an online electronics retailer. The Fabrikam starter store is modeled after an online clothing retailer.
    
      - **Database server**: The name of the server that will host the Retail online store databases
    
      - **Channel database name**: The name of the Retail channel database. If this database does not exist, you must cancel Setup and install a Retail channel database.
    
      - **User name** and **Password**: The credentials for a domain account that has permission to create web applications and execute PowerShell scripts in SharePoint.
    
      - **Pfx file path**: The path to the Pfx file for the SSL certificate.
    
      - **Password**: The password for the Pfx file.
    
      - **Channel operating unit number**: A channel operating unit number is specified when you create an online channel in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client. You must create the channel before you deploy the Retail online store. To locate this operating unit number, click **Retail** \> **Retail channels** \> **Online Stores**.

8.  On the **Prerequisite validation results** page, resolve any errors. For more information about how to resolve prerequisite errors, see [Check prerequisites](check-prerequisites.md). When no errors remain, click **Next**.

9.  On the **Ready to install** page, click **Install**.

10. After the installation is completed, click **Finish** to close the wizard.

If the deployment succeeded, proceed to the Verify deployment section in this document. If the deployment failed check the Microsoft Dynamics AX log file and the Windows event logs for information. For additional troubleshooting support, see the “Troubleshooting deployment issues” section in [Troubleshoot installation issues for a Retail online store](troubleshoot-installation-issues-for-a-retail-online-store.md).

## Option 2: Deploy the Retail online store by using Windows PowerShell

Use this procedure to install the Retail online store manually by using Windows PowerShell. Manual installations are often performed by businesses and organizations that automate deployments by using scripts.

### ![JJ991927.collapse\_all(en-us,AX.60).gif](images/Gg841655.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif "JJ991927.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif")Extract installation files

Use Microsoft Dynamics AX Setup to extract the files that are needed for manual installation. Perform this procedure on the SharePoint server that will host the online store.

1.  Start Microsoft Dynamics AX Setup. Under **Install**, select **Microsoft Dynamics AX components**.

2.  Advance through the first wizard pages.

3.  If the Setup Support files have not yet been installed on this computer, the **Select a file location** page is displayed. The Setup Support files are required for installation. Provide a file location or accept the default location, and then click **Next**. On the **Ready to install** page, click **Install**.

4.  On the **Select installation type** page, click **Custom installation**, and then click **Next**.

5.  On the **Select components** page, select **Retail online channel**, and then click **Next**.

6.  On the **Prerequisite validation results** page, resolve any errors. For more information about how to resolve prerequisite errors, see [Check prerequisites](check-prerequisites.md). When no errors remain, click **Next**.

7.  On the **Configure a Microsoft Dynamics AX Retail online store** page, clear the **Configure Retail online store** option. Click **Next**.

8.  On the **Prerequisite validation results** page, resolve any errors. For more information about how to resolve prerequisite errors, see [Check prerequisites](check-prerequisites.md). When no errors remain, click **Next**.

9.  On the **Ready to install** page, click **Install**.

10. After the installation is completed, click **Finish** to close the wizard. Setup extracts files and creates the following folder on the local server:
    
    C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Dynamics AX\\60\\Retail Online Channel

If you deployed SharePoint on Windows Server 2012, then you must complete the following procedure to ensure that the Microsoft.Web.Administration.dll is not overwritten in the global assembly cache when you execute deployment scripts later in this topic. You do not need to perform this procedure on Windows Server 2008 R2.

1.  Open the manifest.xml file in the following directory on the SharePoint server:
    
    C:\\...\\Retail Online Channel\\StoreFront\\SP

2.  Delete the following line of code from the manifest.xml file:
    
    \<Assembly Location="Microsoft.Web.Administration.dll" DeploymentTarget="GlobalAssemblyCache" /\>

3.  Save and close the file.

The Microsoft.Web.Administration.dll in the global assembly cache will not be overwritten when you execute PowerShell commands later in this topic.

The Retail online store can authenticate users who sign in to your site by using their Facebook credentials. This section describes how to configure your environment for Facebook authentication.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> <P>Facebook integration is optional. However, if you do not want to use Facebook authentication, then you must disable this feature in the oob-topology.xml file. If you do not disable it, the deployment scripts fail. For more information, see <STRONG>Disable Facebook</STRONG> integration later in this topic.</P>



**Create a Facebook application:** Use the following procedure to create a Facebook application that enables Facebook logon to your site.

1.  Logon to the [Facebook developer site](https://developers.facebook.com/apps)

2.  Register as a developer on the Facebook developer site.

3.  Click **Create New App** and then follow the prompts to create a new application.

4.  In the **Select how your application integrates with Facebook** section, click the **Website with Facebook Login** option and specify the Site URL.

5.  Click **Save Changes**.

6.  On the applications landing page, select the application that you just created.

7.  In the oob-settings.xml file, search for **FacebookApplicationId**. Replace the value with the Facebook ID. Retain the quotation marks.

8.  In the oob-settings.xml file, search for **FacebookApplicationSecret**. Replace the value with the secret you created for your Facebook application. Retain the quotation marks.

9.  Save your changes in the oob-settings.xml file.

**Certificates:** Use the following procedure to create certificates for Facebook authentication. For production environments, you must register your domain and obtain a valid, registered SSL certificate from a provider. For developer and evaluation environments, you can use a [self-signed certificate](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=235235). For information about how to work with certificates see [Certificate Overview](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=282620).

2.  Save your changes in the oob-settings.xml file.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can enable Facebook integration in developer environments that are not using a fully registered domain name (for example, www.<EM>DomainName</EM>.com). To do this, you must create host file entries on each computer that will browse the online store. The URL for host file entries must be in the form: http://www.<EM>DomainName</EM>.com/sites/RetailPublishingPortal.</P>



**Update the prerequisite script for Facebook**

A known issue in this version of the Microsoft Dynamics AX Retail online store can cause an installation to fail if you configure Facebook as an identity provider. If you plan to use Facebook as an identity provider, perform the following procedure before you install the online store. If you do not plan to use Facebook as an identity provider, you can skip this procedure.

1.  Open the following folder:
    
    C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Dynamics AX\\60\\Retail Online Channel\\tools

2.  Open the Install-Prerequistes.ps1 file in Microsoft Visual Studio.

3.  Search for line 155:
    
    RoboCopy $trustedIdentityTokenIssuerConfig.CertificateDirectory $certificateLocalCopyDirectory $trustedIdentityTokenIssuerConfig.SigningCertificateCerFileName $trustedIdentityTokenIssuerConfig.SigningCertificatePfxFileName

4.  Replace that line with the following:
    
    RoboCopy $trustedIdentityTokenIssuerConfig.CertificateDirectory $certificateLocalCopyDirectory $trustedIdentityTokenIssuerConfig.SigningCertificateCerFileName $trustedIdentityTokenIssuerConfig.SigningCertificatePfxFileName $trustedIdentityTokenIssuerConfig.SslCertificateAuthorityCerFileName

5.  Save your changes.

**Disable Facebook integration**

If you do not want to enable Facebook authentication for your Retail online store you must disable it, as described in the following procedure. If you previously enabled and configured Facebook authentication you can also use this procedure to disable it.

1.  Open the oob-topology.xml file in Microsoft Visual Studio or a text editor, such as Notepad.

2.  Search in the oob-topology.xml file for the parameter listed in the following table. Enter a value for each parameter. For each value, retain quotation marks (“”) but remove percent signs (%).
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />

    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


3.  Save your changes in the oob-topology.xml file.

After you configure the parameters in the oob-settings.xml file, you can run the Windows PowerShell scripts that deploy and configure the online store.

In this section, you will execute the following scripts to create and configure the online store.

  - InstallPrereqs-SPFarm

  - Generate-WSP

  - Deploy-FarmSolutions

**Toggling options if re-running scripts**

If you re-run the PowerShell deployment scripts in this section, by default, existing databases, web applications, features, and settings are deleted. You can, however, toggle different parameters in the oob-topology.xml file to preserve databases, web applications, features, and settings. Preserving an object means that you change a “true” flag to “false”. For example, in the oob-topology file, in the \<Channel\> section, the Database is configured as follows.

\<Database install="true" dropifexists="true"\>

By changing each flag to “false” the deployment scripts preserve the existing databases.

**Run the script**


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Windows PowerShell includes a security setting called the execution policy that determines how scripts are run. By default, the execution policy is set to <STRONG>Restricted</STRONG>, which prevents any scripts from running. To run the installation scripts for Microsoft Dynamics AX components, we recommend that you set the execution policy to <STRONG>RemoteSigned</STRONG> by using Set-ExecutionPolicy cmdlet. This setting allows you to run scripts that you’ve written and scripts that have been signed by a trusted publisher.</P>



1.  On the server where you want to run the script, open the tools folder where the PowerShell scripts are installed.

2.  If you’re using Windows Server 2012 or a later operating system, use Windows Explorer to open the folder where the scripts are installed. Then click File \> Open Windows PowerShell \> Open Windows PowerShell as administrator.
    
    If you’re using Windows Server 2008 R2 or an earlier operating system, start pw\_wps as the administrator. Then, change the directory by using the following command: CD “\<Path to directory\>”.

3.  Run the following command to verify and install prerequisites for the online store:
    
        .\InstallPrereqs-SPFarm.ps1 oob-topology.xml oob-settings.xml

When the system finishes the operation, you can run the next script.

#### ![JJ991927.collapse\_all(en-us,AX.60).gif](images/Gg841655.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif "JJ991927.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif")Generate-WSP.ps1

This script creates a SharePoint solution package (.WSP file) for your computing environment. The solution package includes properties such as connection strings, URLS, and ports from the oob-topology.xml and oob-settings.xml files. The solution package also includes binaries and static web files that were deployed by Microsoft Dynamics AX Setup to the Retail Online Channel directory.

**Run Generate-WSP.ps1:**

In the Windows PowerShell console, run the following command to generate the WSP file for the online store:

    .\Generate-WSP.ps1 oob-topology.xml oob-settings.xml


> [!IMPORTANT]
> <P>Due to a known issue, the following script can fail with a file access error. If the script fails, re-run it. It should finish successfully the second time.</P>



When the system finishes the operation, you can execute the next script.

#### ![JJ991927.collapse\_all(en-us,AX.60).gif](images/Gg841655.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif "JJ991927.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif")Deploy-FarmSolutions.ps1

This script performs the following actions on the server.

  - Deploys the new SharePoint solution package

  - Activates features

  - Runs post-deployment custom scripts (deploy mode)

If you re-run this script, the system performs the following actions before deploying the solution package or activating features. You can toggle options to preserve settings, as described earlier in this document.

1.  Deactivates features

2.  Uninstalls solution packages

3.  Runs post-deployment custom scripts (retract mode)

**Run Deploy-FarmSolutions.ps1:**

In the Windows PowerShell console, run the following command to deploy the solution to SharePoint.

    .\Deploy-FarmSolutions.ps1 oob-topology.xml oob-settings.xml

When the system finishes the operation, you can verify the deployment.

### ![JJ991927.collapse\_all(en-us,AX.60).gif](images/Gg841655.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif "JJ991927.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif")Verify deployment

If all deployment scripts completed without errors, use this section to help verify the online store deployment. If the deployment scripts returned errors, see [Troubleshoot installation issues for a Retail online store](troubleshoot-installation-issues-for-a-retail-online-store.md).

**Verify that the Connector Service is running**: After a successful deployment, the **Retail Publishing Connector Service 1** is running in SharePoint Central Administration. At this point, the service displays an error “No channel configuration could be found in the database,” which means that the channel has not been configured in Microsoft Dynamics AX yet. For information about configuring a channel, see the section titled *Set up the online store in Microsoft Dynamics AX* in the [Online Store](online-store.md)

Use the following procedure to verify that the **Dynamics AX Publishing Connector** service is running.

1.  In SharePoint Central Administration under **System Settings**, click **Manage services on server**.

2.  Verify that the **Retail Publishing Connector Service 1** is running.

3.  In SharePoint Central Administration, click **Monitoring**, and then click **Check job status**.

4.  Verify that you see jobs listed for the **C1 Application for Retail Store Front – Internal** and the **Out of box Store front – Public**.

**Verify that site collections exist and can be browsed**: After a successful deployment, you can view the Retail online store web applications and site collections in SharePoint Central Administration. If you specified different URLs for your web applications, you must adjust the URLS below accordingly.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you installed the Fabrikam starter store, change port values below from the 40,000 range to the 50,000 range. For example: The Contoso starter store product catalog site is http://ServerName:40001/sites/RetailProductCatalog. The Fabrikam starter store product catalog site is http://ServerName:50001/sites/RetailProductCatalog.</P>



1.  In SharePoint Central Administration, click **Application Management**, and then click **View all site collections**.

2.  On the **C1 Application for Retail Store Front – Internal** web application, copy the http://*ServerName*:40001/sites/RetailProductCatalog URL and paste it into a browser. Verify that the **Welcome to your product catalog site displays**.

3.  In SharePoint Central Administration, click the **Web application** drop-down list and then click **Change web application**.

4.  Click the **Out of box Store front – Public** web application.

5.  In the **URL** section, verify that you see the following URLs:
    
    http://*ServerName*:40002/sites/RetailPublishingPortal
    
    http://*ServerName*:40002

6.  Copy and paste each URL into a browser. Verify that you see the **Contoso electronic superstore** site and the **Contoso electronic superstore sign-in** site. If the sign-in site displays a certificate warning, click **Continue to this web site**. This warning appears if you used a self-signed certificate.

**Verify that you can create and sign-in with a new forms-based user account**: You should be able to register a new user account and logon from the public URL. By completing the sign-up process you verify SQL Server connectivity, SSL port settings, and SSL certificate bindings.

1.  Paste the public URL into a browser and press Enter. For example: http://*ServerName*:40002/sites/RetailPublishingPortal

2.  Click **Register a new account**.

3.  Enter an email address and a strong password in the required fields and then click **Create account**. Note that if you see more than one email and password field on the page, it means that you executed the Deploy-FarmSolutions.ps1 script multiple times on this server. This is a known issue. To create the forms-based user account, you must enter the email address and strong password in each field. Also note that you receive an error after you register the account because the online channel has not been configured in Microsoft Dynamics AX.

4.  Browse the public portal site again (http:// *ServerName*:40002/sites/RetailPublishingPortal).

5.  Click the **Sign In** link and enter the information for the account that you just created. The system logs you onto the Contoso electronics site as a registered user.

**Verify that you can browse the public URL**: If you registered a domain, you should be able to browse the web address for your site. For example, you should be able to browse http://www.\<your\_domain\>.com/sites/RetailPublishingPortal. If you have not yet registered the domain then you must create a hosts file entry and disable proxy settings in your browser (if applicable) before you attempt to browse the web address.

> <P>Before you uninstall, we strongly recommend that you back up your SharePoint farm. If you don't follow the instructions completely, your content database may be corrupted.</P>



### ![JJ991927.collapse\_all(en-us,AX.60).gif](images/Gg841655.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif "JJ991927.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif")Uninstall if you used Setup to install

If you installed an online store by using Setup, then you can either run Setup again to remove it, or use Control Panel \> Add or Remove Programs.

### ![JJ991927.collapse\_all(en-us,AX.60).gif](images/Gg841655.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif "JJ991927.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif")Uninstall if you installed with Windows PowerShell

If you used settings and topology files to configure the online store, then run the undeploy script from the Microsoft Dynamics Windows PowerShell prompt. The following example removes the default instance deployed by Setup.

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Dynamics AX\60\Retail Online Channel\Tools\UnDeployRetailOnlineChannel.ps1 -TopologyXmlFilePath oob-topology-updated.xml -SettingsXmlFilePath oob-settings-updated.xml

To remove a non-default instance, change the name of the XML file in the parameters to the appropriate file.

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Dynamics AX\60\Retail Online Channel\Tools\UnDeployRetailOnlineChannel.ps1  -TopologyXmlFilePath oob-topology-updatedFabrikam.xml   -SettingsXmlFilePath oob-settings-updatedFabrikam.xml


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you have multiple online channels, you must run the script with the appropriate settings and topology file for each online channel.</P>



### ![JJ991927.collapse\_all(en-us,AX.60).gif](images/Gg841655.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif "JJ991927.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif")Uninstall if you installed with Windows PowerShell, and no longer have the original settings and topologies file

Use the following procedure if you installed with a settings file, but no longer have the file.

1.  In **SharePoint Central Administration**, under **System Settings**, click **Manage Farm Features**.

2.  Clear **Claims Provider**, **Logging Service**, and **Publishing Job**. If these features are not present, skip this step.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Site level features will be automatically uninstalled when you uninstall the parent solutions.</P>



3.  In **Central Administration**, under **System Settings**, click **Manage Farm Solutions**. For each of the following solutions, choose to retract immediately, and then click **OK**.
    
      - Publisher Job
    
      - StoreFront
    
      - Common Global Modules
        

        > [!NOTE]
        > <P>This package is shared across all instances of storefront.</P>

    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>While you complete these steps, an IIS reset will occur, and Central Administration might become unavailable. If so, wait and try again.</P>



4.  After all the solutions have been retracted, remove the solution for each entry.
    
    1.  In **Central Administration**, under **Manage Web Applications**, delete all of the web applications by clicking **Delete**, and then clicking **Delete Web Application**.
    
    2.  Click **Yes** when you are prompted to delete content databases and to delete IIS websites. This step can take some time to complete.
