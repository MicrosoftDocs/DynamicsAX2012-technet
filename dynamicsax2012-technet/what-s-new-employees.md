# What's new: Employees 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Employees are now a type of worker. A worker can be a person who is either a contractor or an employee. Multiple tables throughout Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 have been renamed or changed to reflect this change in the conceptual model.

## Overview

## New functionality

Enhanced effective date patterns have been added to track past, current, and future transactions that are related to the worker record. You can also hire, transfer, and terminate workers more easily now. Additionally, you can more easily move a worker’s employment records from one legal entity to another and track a worker’s employment history.

## Special considerations

Employees and contractors are now shared entities. The worker table (HcmWorker) is no longer assigned to a specific data area ID. You can use the employment record (HcmEmployment) to assign a worker to multiple legal entities. You can also use XDS security policies to mimic containment of the worker data by legal entity.

The following information must also be considered:

  - You can use security roles to provide self-service capabilities for workers through Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX.

  - Worker status is now derived from employment status.

  - Work centers are no longer part of the Employee table.

  - Competencies are associated with the person, not with the virtual network. Additionally, competencies are shared across legal entities.

  - The **Delete personal information** option has been removed from the Employee Wizard.

  - You can still assign absence and compensation functionality to a data area ID. Therefore, the absence and compensation functionality is contained through the current legal entity context. When you modify absence and compensation information for a worker, you must be logged on to the legal entity that you want to record the absence and compensation records in.

## Comparison with Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009

This feature has changed considerably since AX 2009. AX 2012 includes changes to the following areas:

  - Human resources

  - Signature authority
