# Install the debugger 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The debugger tool provides debugging capabilities for X++ developers. The debugger tool communicates with the Microsoft Dynamics AX client, .NET Business Connector, or batch jobs that run on the Microsoft Dynamics AX server.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>To use the Help documentation for the debugger, the Microsoft Dynamics AX client must also be installed.</P>



## Before you install the debugger

On the computer where you plan to install this component, run the prerequisite validation utility to verify that system requirements have been met. For information about how to run the prerequisite validation utility, see [Check prerequisites](check-prerequisites.md).

For more information about the hardware and software requirements for Microsoft Dynamics AX, see the [system requirements](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=165377).

## Install the debugger

8.  If you are installing on a 64-bit operating system, the **Select a file location** page is displayed. Select the location where you want to install 32-bit versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX files, and then click **Next**.

9.  On the **Prerequisite validation results** page, resolve any errors. When no errors remain, click **Next**.
