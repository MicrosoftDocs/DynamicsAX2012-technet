    <li><p>To specify the starting point, select a person in the <strong>Start from</strong> list.</p></li>
    <li><p>To specify the ending point, click <strong>Add condition</strong>. Then enter a condition that determines where in the hierarchy the system stops retrieving names.</p></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Click the <strong>Hierarchy options</strong> tab.</p></li>
    <li><p>Specify which users in the range the step is assigned to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Assign to all users retrieved</strong> – The step is assigned to all users in the range.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Assign only to last user retrieved</strong> – The step is assigned only to the last user in the range.</p></li>

    </tbody>
    </table>


3.  Click the **Time limit** tab.

4.  In the **Duration** field, specify how much time the user has to act on, or respond to, documents that reach the approval step. Select one of the following options:
    
      - **Hours** – Enter the number of hours that the user has to respond. Then select the calendar that your organization uses, and enter information about your organization's work week.
    
      - **Days** – Enter the number of days that the user has to respond. Then select the calendar that your organization uses, and enter information about your organization's work week.
    
      - **Weeks** – Enter the number of weeks that the user has to respond.
    
      - **Months** – Select the day and week by which the user must respond. For example, you may want the user to respond by Friday of the third week of the month.
    
      - **Years** – Select the day, week, and month by which the user must respond. For example, you may want the user to respond by Friday of the third week of December.
    
    If the user does not act on the document in the allotted time, the document is overdue. A document that is overdue is escalated, based on the options that you select in the **Escalation** area of this form.

5.  If you assigned the approval step to multiple users, or to a group of users, click the **Completion policy** tab, and then select one of the following options:
    
    **Single approver** – The action that is applied to the document is determined by the first person who responds.
    
    For example, Sam has submitted an expense report for USD 15,000. The expense report is currently assigned to Sue, Jo, and Bill. If Sue is the first person who responds to the document, the action that she takes is applied to the document. If Sue rejects the document, it is rejected and sent back to Sam. If Sue approves the document, it is sent to Ann for approval.
    
    ![Workflow that has an approval process](images/Gg731883.Workflow_MultipleUsersInStep(AX.60).gif "Workflow that has an approval process")
    
    **Majority of approvers** – The action that is applied to the document is determined when most of the approvers respond.
    
    For example, Sam has submitted an expense report for USD 15,000. The expense report is currently assigned to Sue, Jo, and Bill. If Sue and Jo are the first two approvers who respond, the action that they take is applied to the document.
    
      - If Sue approves the document, but Jo rejects it, the document is rejected and sent back to Sam.
    
      - If both Sue and Jo approve the document, it is sent to Ann for approval.
    
    **Percentage of approvers** – The action that is applied to the document is determined when a specific percentage of the approvers respond.
    
    For example, Sam has submitted an expense report for USD 15,000. The expense report is currently assigned to Sue, Jo, and Bill, and you entered **50** as the percentage. If Sue and Jo are the first two approvers who respond, the action that they take is applied to the document because they meet the requirement for 50 percent of approvers.
    
      - If Sue approves the document, but Jo rejects it, the document is rejected and sent back to Sam.
    
      - If both Sue and Jo approve the document, it is sent to Ann for approval.
    
    **All approvers** – All the approvers must approve the document. Otherwise, the workflow cannot continue.
    
    For example, Sam has submitted an expense report for USD 15,000. The expense report is currently assigned to Sue, Jo, and Bill. If Sue and Joe approve the document, but Bill rejects it, the document is rejected and sent back to Sam. If Sue, Jo, and Bill all approve the document, it is sent to Ann for approval.

## Specify when the approval step is required

You can specify when the approval step is required. The approval step may always be required, or it may be required only if specific conditions are met.

## The approval step is always required

Follow these steps if the approval step is always required.

1.  In the left pane, click **Condition**.

2.  Select the **Always run this step** option.

## The approval step is required in specific conditions

The approval step that you are configuring may be required only if specific conditions are met. For example, if you are configuring an approval step for a purchase requisition workflow, you may want the approval step to occur only if the amount of the purchase requisition is more than USD 10,000.

Follow these steps to specify when the approval step is required.

1.  In the left pane, click **Condition**.

2.  Select the **Run this step only when the following condition is met** option.

3.  Enter a condition.

4.  Enter additional conditions, as needed.

5.  To verify that the conditions that you entered are configured correctly, complete the following steps:
    
    1.  Click **Test**. The **Test workflow condition** form is displayed.
    
    2.  Select a record in the **Validate condition** area of the form.
    
    3.  Click **Test**. The system evaluates the record to determine whether it meets the conditions that you defined.
    
    4.  Click **OK** or **Cancel** to return to the **Properties** form.

## Specify what happens when the document is overdue

If a user does not act on a document in the allotted time, the document is overdue. A document that is overdue can be escalated, or assigned automatically to another user for approval. Follow these steps to escalate the document if it is overdue.

1.  In the left pane, click **Escalation**.

2.  Select the **Use escalation path** check box to create an escalation path. The system automatically assigns the document to the users who are listed in the escalation path.
    
    For example, the following table represents an escalation path.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><p>Sequence</p></th>
    <th><p>Escalation path</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>1</p></td>
    <td><p>Assign to: Donna</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p>2</p></td>
    <td><p>Assign to: Erin</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>3</p></td>
    <td><p>Final action: Reject</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    
    In this example, the system assigns the overdue document to Donna. If Donna does not respond in the allotted time, the system assigns the document to Erin. If Erin does not respond in the allotted time, the system rejects the document.

3.  To add a user to the escalation path, click **Add escalation**. Click the **Assignment type** tab, select one of the options in the following table, and then follow the additional steps for the option before you go to step 4.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>

    <col style="width: 33%" />
    <col style="width: 33%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><p>Option</p></th>
    <th><p>Users that the document is escalated to</p></th>
    <th><p>Additional steps</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">

    <li><p><strong>Exclude users with the following condition:</strong> – The document is not escalated to any users in the range who meet a specific condition. Click <strong>Add condition</strong> to specify the condition.</p></li>
    </ul></li>
    </ol></td>

    <li><p>In the <strong>Workflow user</strong> list, select a user who participates in the workflow.</p></li>
    </ol></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>User</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Specific Microsoft Dynamics AX users</p></td>
    <td><ol>
    <li><p>After you select <strong>User</strong>, click the <strong>User</strong> tab.</p></li>
    <li><p>The <strong>Available users:</strong> list includes all Microsoft Dynamics AX users. Select the users to escalate the document to, and then move these users to the <strong>Selected users:</strong> list.</p></li>
    </ol></td>
