# About product models 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A product model is an executable schema that enables the configuration of an item by using the user dialog box that is based on a set of modeling and calculation variables, validation rules and modeling tree nodes.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This information applies only to Product builder.</P>



Product models are only created for products with the **Modeling enabled** check box selected on the **Released product details** form.

When you create a product model, at a minimum you must:

  - Create modeling variables

  - Create modeling variable groups

  - Create calculation variables

  - Set up validation rules

  - Insert nodes in the modeling tree

When you develop a product model in Product Builder, you extend the code base of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 with new X++ code. Be sure to secure any external resources used by your product model, such as graphics and files, in addition to the applicationâ€™s temporary folder.
