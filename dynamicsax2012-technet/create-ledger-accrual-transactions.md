_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Journals** \> **General journal**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a line.

3.  Click **Lines**.

4.  In the **Journal voucher** form, press CTRL+N to create a journal line, select a ledger account, enter an amount to be accrued, and then optionally select an offset account.

5.  Click **Functions**, and then click **Ledger accruals**.

6.  In the **Ledger accruals** form, select the accrual identification that you want to process.

7.  Optionally, change the amount in the **Base amount** field, which is the amount from the journal lines minus the sales tax amount, because sales taxes are not accrued.
