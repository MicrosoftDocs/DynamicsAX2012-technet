# (BRA) Dispose of a CIAP fixed asset 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

When a fixed asset that is tracked through CIAP fiscal books is disposed of by selling or scrapping, the tracking and the fixed asset tax credit accumulation must stop, and the remaining tax credit balance must be printed on a corresponding invoice.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic applies only if KB 2839295 and KB 2850595 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 are installed, if cumulative update 6 or later for AX 2012 R2 is installed, or if AX 2012 R3 is installed.</P>



This information explains how to set up transactions for disposing of assets by selling or scrapping them.

## Dispose a fixed asset

In the **Fixed asset posting profiles** form, on the **Ledger accounts** FastTab, select **Disposal - sale** and **Disposal - scrap** to set up the accounts for posting to the ledger.

For both transaction types, the ledger account is credited for the disposal value of the fixed asset. The debit is posted to an offset account, which might be, for example, a bank account. If a fixed asset is sold to a customer, the customer account is used instead of the offset account.

Click **Disposal** and click **Sale** or **Scrap**, and then set up detailed accounts to reverse the net book value of the fixed asset. You can also enter information in the **Post value** and **Sales value type** fields in the **Disposal parameters** form.

The disposal transaction for an asset in a low-value pool reduces the net book value of the low-value pool by only the disposed amount. However, when the sale of an asset is more than the net book value of the low-value pool, the net book value is reduced to zero.
