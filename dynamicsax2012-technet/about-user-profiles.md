# About user profiles 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

User profiles let you control which modeling variables each user can see and interact with in the user dialog box as an item is being configured and sold. This topic provides general information about user profiles.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This information applies only to Product builder.</P>



User profiles are useful when you want to customize the user dialog box of your product model for specific user groups, particularly when product modeling is being used in connection with the **Customer self-service** module and the Internet. For a well-functioning user profile setup, you must create a separate user profile for each type of user that will access your product models.

To control which modeling variables are visible to the user, you must attach user profiles to those variables.

A modeling variable that has no user profiles attached is available to users in all user profiles.

Before you can attach user profiles to a set of modeling variables, you must create the required profiles. Similarly, the user profiles that you create should be attached to employees and users.
