# mobile device

A piece of handheld equipment such as a portable music or video player, PDA (personal digital assistant), mobile phone, or warehouse device that works on its own but can also be connected to a computer. Many of these devices can sync information with Windows. Warehouse mobile devices use barcode technology to process inventory operations.
