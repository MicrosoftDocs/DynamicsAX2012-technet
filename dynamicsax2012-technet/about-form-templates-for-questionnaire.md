# About form templates for questionnaire [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Form templates are an optional feature that you can use to display a background behind questions during an answer session. For more information, see [Prerequisites for questionnaire](prerequisites-for-questionnaire.md).

Form templates provide a background image that respondents will see when they complete questionnaires. If a form template is not specified, the questions are displayed against a blank background. These templates support many graphic file formats, except for the .gif file name extension. Verify with a system administrator that the file formats that are used are supported by your system.
