# Manage load balancing 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use load balancing in Microsoft Dynamics AX to distribute the user load among multiple instances of Application Object Server (AOS). AOS load balancing in Microsoft Dynamics AX has the following benefits:

  - Less downtime – If one AOS instance fails, new sessions can be automatically routed to other AOS instances.

  - Easier maintenance – If you take one AOS instance offline for maintenance, other AOS instances handle the load.

  - Greater scalability – AOS instances can be added as they are required.

The topics in this section provide information about load balancing.
