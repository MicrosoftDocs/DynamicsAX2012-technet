# Create purchase orders manually from purchase requisitions 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use this procedure to create purchase orders manually from approved purchase requisitions.

If you are in the public sector and will be using general budget reservations, see also [About general budget reservations (Public sector)](about-general-budget-reservations-public-sector.md).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>General budget reservations are available only if the <STRONG>Public Sector</STRONG> configuration key is selected and if Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 Cumulative Update 8 is installed with the following hotfix: KB3047235</P>



If a purchase requisition has already been referenced by a general budget reservation, it will no longer be available for manual purchase order creation.

A purchase order is created for each currency, vendor, or legal entity that is identified on the purchase requisition lines. For example, if a purchase requisition has two lines, and each line has a different vendor, currency, or legal entity, two purchase orders are created. Also, depending on how purchasing policies are configured for your organization, separate purchase orders can be created if the purchase requisition lines have different requesters, line types, or procurement categories.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Public sector entities that use commitments to manage budget reservations cannot create purchase orders from purchase requisitions. For more information, see <A href="fra-about-commitments-public-sector.md">(FRA) About commitments (Public sector)</A>.</P>



## Create a purchase order manually from a purchase requisition

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Common** \> **Purchase requisitions** \> **Release approved purchase requisitions**.
    
    This form lists all the approved purchase requisition lines for which no purchase order lines have been created. The list is sorted by consolidation status, purchase requisition ID and line.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Purchase requisition lines that have been added to an open consolidation opportunity cannot be added to a purchase order from the <STRONG>Release approved purchase requisitions</STRONG> list page. Instead, they must be added to a purchase order from the consolidation opportunity. For more information about how to create a consolidation opportunity, see <A href="key-tasks-consolidate-purchase-requisitions.md">Key tasks: Consolidate purchase requisitions</A>.</P>



2.  Select the purchase requisition lines that you want to create a purchase order for.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, in the **New** group, click **Purchase order**.

An Infolog message appears and lists the purchase orders that have been created. The requisition lines are removed from the **Release approved purchase requisitions** form.

All information on the purchase requisition lines is copied to the purchase order lines. However, if price information such as a trade agreement or a base price is available, some of the amounts might be recalculated based on policy rules for price and discount transfers. The following table describes whether line prices and discounts are recalculated when the purchase order is created.
