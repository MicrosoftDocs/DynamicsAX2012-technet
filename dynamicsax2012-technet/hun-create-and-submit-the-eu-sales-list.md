_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Businesses that supply goods to companies in other European Union (EU) countries/regions must submit periodic reports to the appropriate authorities in their own countries/regions. Quarterly reports are typically required to be submitted no later than 10 days after the end of the quarter. For example, first-quarter reports are due April 10.

2.  Click **Transfer** to transfer the customer invoices or project invoices that have been entered for customers in other EU countries/regions to this form.

3.  In the **Transfer transactions for EU sales list** form, select one or more reporting types.
    
      - **Item** – Select this option to include information for transaction lines for products that have a product type of **Item**. This option also includes transaction lines that are identified by descriptions and categories, and that use an item sales tax group that has a reporting type of **Item**.

      - **Not assigned** – Select this option to include information for transaction lines that are not assigned to any of the other three reporting types. This option includes transaction lines that use an item sales tax group that has a blank reporting type.

4.  Click **Select** to specify information for the fields in the **Customer invoice journal** and **Project invoice** field groups.
    
    1.  In the **Date** field, enter the period for which the invoices should be selected.

    1.  Select the transaction that you want to mark as a correction.
    
    2.  On the **Correction** tab, select the **Corrected** check box.
    
    3.  To specify that the reason for the correction is an incorrect registration number, amount, or period, select the appropriate check box in the **Correction reason** field group.
