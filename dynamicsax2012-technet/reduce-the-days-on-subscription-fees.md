# Reduce the days on subscription fees 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

To reduce the number of days of an existing subscription fee, you can create a new transaction in which you remove the period of time that should no longer be part of the subscription fee interval.

## Reduce the days on a subscription fee

1.  Click **Service management** \> **Common** \> **Service subscriptions** \> **All service subscriptions**. Select the service subscription, and on the Action Pane, click **Subscription fees**

2.  In the **Subscription type** field, select **Reduction days**.

3.  Use the **From date** field and the **To date** fields to define the date interval of the subscription fee that you want to remove from the subscription fee period, and then click **OK**.

To view the transaction that was created, in the **Subscription** form, click **Fee transactions**.

## Example

If a subscription transaction period runs from January 1 to January 31, and you want to reduce the period by 10 days, create a new transaction in which the reduction period is January 1 to January 10. (The reduction period could also be January 5 to January 15, or any other ten day period).

Also, if the **From date** on the reduction period is January 21 (31 minus 10), you could set the **To date** to any date after January 31, and 10 days will still be removed from the fee transaction period.
