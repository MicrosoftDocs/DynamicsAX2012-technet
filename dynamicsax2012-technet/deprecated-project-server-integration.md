# Deprecated: Project Server integration [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

Support for Microsoft Project Server integration is being deprecated in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3. This feature was released in earlier versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX to provide out-of-box integration between **Project management and accounting** in Microsoft Dynamics AX and Project Server.

<td><p>Reason for deprecation</p></td>
<td><p>This feature enables integration of Microsoft Dynamics AX projects with Project Server capabilities, such as timesheets and portfolio and resource management. In AX 2012 R3, we have introduced simpler, out-of-box integration with Microsoft Project through an add-in. This solution lets you link Microsoft Project MPP files with projects in Microsoft Dynamics AX. Project Server integration is still available in AX 2012 R3, but Microsoft is announcing its intention to deprecate this feature in future releases. We encourage customers and partners to use the new Microsoft Project add-in instead.</p></td>

<td><p>An add-in for integrating Microsoft Dynamics AX projects with the Microsoft Project client application was first released in cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 and is available in AX 2012 R3. Direct integration with Microsoft Project is easy to configure, and provides an alternative to planning and staffing projects only in Microsoft Project.</p>
