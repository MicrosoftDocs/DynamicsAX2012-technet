# (BRA) Set up parameters for SPED ECD text files 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic describes how to specify how Sistema Publico de Escrituração Digital (SPED) fiscal text files will be saved before you submit them to the federal tax authorities.

The SPED fiscal text files contain information about general ledger transactions, profit and loss information, and balance sheet information. The SPED ECD system is used by federal tax authorities to verify taxable profits of a company. For information about how to generate the yearly SPED ECD fiscal text file, see [(BRA) Generate and validate the SPED ECD statement](bra-generate-and-validate-the-sped-ecd-statement.md).
