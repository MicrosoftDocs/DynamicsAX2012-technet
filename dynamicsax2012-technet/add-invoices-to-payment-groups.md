# Add invoices to payment groups 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can add invoices to payment groups to group invoices by a common code. If one invoice in the payment group is settled, the other invoices in the group are included in the same settlement.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Invoices that belong to the same payment group must be settled at the same time. If one invoice in a payment group cannot be settled for any reason, no invoices in the same payment group can be settled. For example, if an invoice in the FIRE payment group is not approved, that invoice must be approved or removed from the payment group before the other invoices in the FIRE payment group can be settled.</P>
