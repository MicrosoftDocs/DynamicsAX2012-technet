# Add an output order to an existing shipment 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This topic applies to features in the **Inventory management** module. It does not apply to features in the [Warehouse management](warehouse-management.md) module.

In situations where an order is received while a shipment to the customer is already in progress, an output order can be manually added so that the customer receives all items in one shipment.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>An output order can be added only if it originates at the same site as the site that is specified for the shipment that you want to add it to.</P>



1.  Click **Inventory management** \> **Common** \> **Shipments**.

2.  In the **Shipments** form, select the shipment to add an output order to, and then click **Show lines**.

3.  In the **Shipment lines** form, click **Add**.

4.  In the **Output order** form, select the output orders to add to the shipment.

For information about how to add output orders to a shipment automatically, see [Shipment templates (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa634909\(v=ax.60\)).
