3.  Click the **Time limit** tab.

4.  In the **Duration** field, specify how much time the user has to make the decision. Select one of the following options:
    
      - **Hours** – Enter the number of hours that the user has to make the decision. Then select the calendar that your organization uses, and enter information about your organization's work week.
    
      - **Days** – Enter the number of days that the user has to make the decision. Then select the calendar that your organization uses, and enter information about your organization's work week.
    
      - **Weeks** – Enter the number of weeks that the user has to make the decision.
    
      - **Months** – Select the day and week by which the user must make the decision. For example, you may want the user to make the decision by Friday of the third week of the month.
    
      - **Years** – Select the day, week, and month by which the user must make the decision. For example, you may want the user to make the decision by Friday of the third week of December.
    
    If the user does not make the decision in the allotted time, the decision is overdue. A decision that is overdue is escalated, based on the options that you select in the **Escalation** area of this form.

## Specify what happens when a decision is overdue

If a user does not make the decision in the allotted time, the decision is overdue and can be escalated, or assigned to another user. Follow these steps to escalate the decision if it is overdue.

1.  In the left pane, click **Escalation**.

2.  Select the **Use escalation path** check box to create an escalation path. The system assigns the decision to the users who are listed in the escalation path.
    
    For example, the following table represents an escalation path.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><p>Sequence</p></th>
    <th><p>Escalation path</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>1</p></td>
    <td><p>Assign to: Donna</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p>2</p></td>
    <td><p>Assign to: Erin</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>3</p></td>
    <td><p>Final action: [Choice 1]</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    
    In this example, the system assigns the overdue decision to Donna. If Donna does not make the decision in the allotted time, the system assigns the decision to Erin. If Erin does not make the decision in the allotted time, the system selects **\[Choice 1\]** as the decision.

3.  To add a user to the escalation path, click **Add escalation**. Select one of the options in the following table, and then follow the additional steps for the option before you go to step 4.

    <ul>
    <li><p>To specify the starting point, select a person in the <strong>Start from</strong> list.</p></li>
    <li><p>To specify the ending point, click <strong>Add condition</strong>. Then enter a condition that determines where in the hierarchy the system stops retrieving names.</p></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p>Click the <strong>Hierarchy options</strong> tab.</p></li>
    <li><p>Specify which users in the range the decision is escalated to:</p>
