# Virtual company scenarios: Financials 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This topic describes the table collections that must be set up to support some common virtual company scenarios in the financial modules of Microsoft Dynamics AX. For an overview of the concept of virtual companies, and for step-by-step instructions to create table collections and virtual company accounts, see [Virtual company accounts in Microsoft Dynamics AX](virtual-company-accounts-in-microsoft-dynamics-ax.md).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The first table in each list is the base table of the table collection. Other tables in the list are referenced by the base table.</P>



## Scenario: Use common reason codes for transaction processing

Reason codes can be applied when a user reverses one of the following transactions:

  - A general journal entry

  - A customer transaction that originates in Accounts receivable, such as a free text invoice or payment

  - A vendor transaction that originates in Accounts payable, such as a journal or vendor invoice

  - A payment in Bank

Create a virtual company account to share reason codes among company accounts. Create the following table collection to include in the virtual company.

## Scenario: Establish common groups that can be used for reporting and analysis

The following groups can be created in Microsoft Dynamics AX:

However, this information is validated only in the current company. For other companies where the BankCustPaymIdTable table is shared, make sure that the maximum length will accommodate payment IDs.</P>
