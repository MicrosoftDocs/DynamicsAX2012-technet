# What's new: Address book 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, the address book functionality has been enhanced. You can now create multiple address books instead of creating virtual companies. You can also control access to address books by granting privileges based on teams or legal entities. Additionally, your Human resources department can now create applicant records directly from the **Applicant** form.

## Overview

## New functionality

In AX 2012, you can define any number of address books, and assign teams or legal entities to those address books. In this manner, you can control which workers have access to specific address books. You can also select whether policies are enforced for a specific address book or for all address books in a legal entity in your organization.

Additionally, Human resource applicant records can be created from the **Applicant** form and stored in the address book.

## Comparison with Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009

The global address book has changed considerably since AX 2009. AX 2012 includes changes to the following areas:
