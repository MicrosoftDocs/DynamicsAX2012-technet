# About request for quotation statuses 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The status of a request for quotation (RFQ) is shown in the RFQ header and depends on the statuses of the RFQ lines. The status indicates the extent to which you have processed the RFQ. Each RFQ has two values for the status: lowest and highest. The lowest status is the least advanced stage of any line in the RFQ, and the highest status is the most advanced stage of any line in the RFQ. For example, if the least advanced stage in an RFQ is for a line that has been created, the lowest status for the RFQ is **Created**. If the most advanced stage in the RFQ is for a line that has been sent to vendors, the highest status for the RFQ is **Sent**. The statuses are automatically updated as you process an RFQ.

You can view the lowest and highest statuses for an RFQ header on the **All requests for quotations** list page. You can view the lowest and highest statuses for an RFQ line on the **Lines** tab in the RFQ form.

The sequence of statuses for processing an RFQ is as follows:

  - **Created**

  - **Sent**

  - **Received**

  - **Accepted**/**Canceled**/**Rejected**

The lowest and highest statuses of an RFQ can change throughout the RFQ process.

## Creating and sending an RFQ

The following table shows RFQ status changes when you create an RFQ and send it to vendors.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 20%" />
<col style="width: 20%" />
<col style="width: 20%" />
<col style="width: 20%" />
<col style="width: 20%" />
</colgroup>

<th><p>Highest RFQ line status</p></th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

<td><p>Created</p></td>

<tr class="even">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can add more vendors to an RFQ at any time, and the lowest and highest statuses change to reflect the vendors that were added. For example, if you received bids from all vendors and accepted at least one line on a bid, the lowest status in the RFQ header is <STRONG>Rejected</STRONG>, and the highest status is <STRONG>Accepted</STRONG>. If you add a new vendor, the lowest status on any line is now <STRONG>Created</STRONG>. Therefore, the lowest status in the RFQ header changes to <STRONG>Created</STRONG>, and the highest status remains <STRONG>Accepted</STRONG>.</P>
