# (BRA) Create and post a return sales order 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can return items that do not meet quality standards, do not meet customer order specifications, and items that are damaged in transit. You can create and post a return sales order to generate an incoming fiscal document for the returned items.

When you create a return sales order, a Return Materials Authorization (RMA) number is assigned to the return sales order in the **Sales order** form. The fiscal information, such as fiscal document type, Código Fiscal de Operações e Prestações (CFOP), service code, delivery CFOP, operation type, and the presence type of the fiscal operation for the return sales order is updated with the information in the original sales fiscal document. The tax groups for the return sales order are updated based on the tax matrix that is defined in the **Taxes matrix** form. For more information, see [(BRA) Set up a tax matrix](bra-set-up-a-tax-matrix.md).

You must select the **Generate incoming fiscal document** check box for the customer in the **Customers** form to generate and print an incoming fiscal document when you post a fiscal document for a sales return. You must set up a fiscal document type and assign it to a customer before you create and post a return sales order. For more information, see [(BRA) Set up fiscal document types](bra-set-up-fiscal-document-types.md) and [(BRA) Assign fiscal document types for customers or vendors](bra-assign-fiscal-document-types-for-customers-or-vendors.md).
