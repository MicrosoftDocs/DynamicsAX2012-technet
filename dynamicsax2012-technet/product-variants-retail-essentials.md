# Product variants (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

In Retail essentials, you can define a product as a *product master*. After you define a product master, you can use dimensions, such as size, color, and style, to define product variants. For example, a particular shirt might have variants that are combinations of size, color, and style.

To create a product variant, you must define at least one product dimension for a product master. Product dimensions are characteristics that serve to identify a product variant. You can use combinations of product dimensions to define product variants.

After you define dimensions, you can set up variant groups. For example, a size group that is named **Men's Shoes** contains the specific sizes in which menâ€™s shoes are available. Alternatively, a color group that is named **Television** contains the specific colors in which television sets are available, such as **Gray**, **Silver**, and **Black**.

You can assign a variant group directly to a product. However, to save time, you can assign the variant group to a category in a retail hierarchy. Then, when you assign a new product to the retail hierarchy, the variant group is assigned automatically to the product.

To create product variants, you must complete the following tasks:

1.  Set up dimensions, such as size, color, and style.

2.  Set up variant groups.

3.  Assign variant groups to a retail hierarchy.

4.  Create a product master and variants. For more information about products and product masters, see [Set up retail products (Retail essentials)](set-up-retail-products-retail-essentials.md).

The topics in this section provide information about how to set up variants for retail products.
