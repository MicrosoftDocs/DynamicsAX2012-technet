# View inquiries and reports overview 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

The topics in this section provide information about inquiries and reports.

[View store transactions](view-store-transactions.md)

The standard reports that are included with Microsoft Dynamics AX can be used in **Retail**. However, **Retail** also provides additional inquiry capabilities and reporting options.

Both inquiries and reports provide filtering and sorting. Therefore, you can quickly view the information that you want. Additionally, you can perform custom filtering by date. You can also generate transaction-level and statistics-level reports based on the time, so that you can analyze the sales flow throughout the day. Additionally, you can display a graphical representation of sales by item and store.

**Retail** provides reports that are built on statistic tables, item value entries, and transactions from the registers. These reports can help you determine which items or variants are selling best, and which stores, registers, and staff are performing best.

All the standard sales reports that are included with Microsoft Dynamics AX can be used to analyze sales information. However, the standard Microsoft Dynamics AX reports do not include products that are included in statements that have not been posted.
