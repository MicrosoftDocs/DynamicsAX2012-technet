# What's new: Enterprise Portal 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

## What's new

The following table lists new features and changes for Enterprise Portal users. For a list of features and changes for Enterprise Portal administrators, see the [What’s new](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=188672) topic for system administrators.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> <P>The pages in Enterprise Portal are organized by Role Centers and module sites. Your ability to access Role Centers and module sites depends on how your Microsoft Dynamics AX administrator configured your role, security features, site permissions, and a new feature in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 called data partitioning. If a partition is specified, you are automatically redirected to the Enterprise Portal site and the partition configured by your administrator. If you attempt to log into Enterprise Portal and you have not been granted permission in the partition you receive an access denied message. If you receive an access denied message, speak with your Microsoft Dynamics AX administrator.</P>
