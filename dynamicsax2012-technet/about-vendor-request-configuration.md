# About vendor request configuration 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Workers in your company may want to purchase products from a vendor who is not approved to do business with your company. Or they may want to work with a vendor who is already approved to do business with your organization in another legal entity or procurement category. Workers can submit requests to add new vendors to the vendor master or extend existing vendors into additional legal entities or procurement categories. These requests are routed, via workflow, to an approver. If a request is approved, the vendor becomes a prospective vendor.

Prospective vendors are invited to complete and submit an application on the **Vendor registration** page in Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX. Information in the vendor profile includes company address information, contact information, other business-related information such as tax ID and DBA information, and banking details. After the vendor completes and submits the application, it is routed, via workflow, to an approver. Approvers can request additional information, if it is required. When all necessary information has been provided, the completed profile is evaluated. If it is approved, the vendor is added to the vendor master for the company.

When you define vendor request configurations, you are defining the appearance of the vendor request pages in Enterprise Portal and in other portals. Those portals include the Employee services portal, the Vendor portal, and the Unsolicited vendors portal.

**Vendor request prerequisites**

Before vendor requests can be submitted to workflow, the following configuration steps must be completed:

  - Number sequences for vendor requests must be set up in the **Procurement and sourcing parameters** form. For more information, see [Set up procurement and sourcing parameters](set-up-procurement-and-sourcing-parameters.md).

  - Workflows must be configured for new vendor add justifications and new vendor applications. For more information, see [Set up Procurement and sourcing workflows](set-up-procurement-and-sourcing-workflows.md).

  - Workflow must be configured for user requests. For more information, see [Set up Organization administration workflows](set-up-organization-administration-workflows.md).
    

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > <P>If you do not configure workflow for user requests, the vendor request cannot move from the <STRONG>Request pending approval</STRONG> status to the <STRONG>Request pending complete</STRONG> status.</P>



  - Workflow must be enabled. For more information, see [Configuring the workflow system](configuring-the-workflow-system.md).

The following table defines the types of vendor requests that are available and the name and location of the corresponding pages in Enterprise Portal.
