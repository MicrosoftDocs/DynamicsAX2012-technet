# About the Vendor portal 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The Vendor portal is a website where you, as an approved vendor for an organization, can interact with your customer. In the Vendor portal, you can maintain your vendor profile information and process transactions with the customer organization.

The tasks that an employee in your organization can complete in the Vendor portal are determined by the user role that is assigned to the employee. User roles are assigned when users are granted access to the website. For more information, see [About user roles](about-user-roles.md).

In the Vendor portal, you can perform the following tasks:

  - View and maintain your profile information. Your profile includes the names of contacts in your organization that are authorized to interact with the customer.

  - Maintain your catalogs of products that are available to the customer, if you have authorization from the customer to import catalogs.

  - Request to add workers from your organization as users in the Vendor portal.

  - Request to be added to additional customer procurement categories.

  - Respond to questionnaires from the customer.

  - View notifications from the customer.

  - Respond to new requests for quotations (RFQs).

  - View the status of purchase orders and product receipts.

  - Create and submit invoices to the customer.

  - View reports from the customer about your performance as a vendor.

## Maintain your vendor profile

You can update your vendor profile. For example, you can change your address. For more information, see [Maintain your company profile](maintain-your-company-profile.md).

## Maintain product catalogs

Create and maintain catalog maintenance request (CMR) files. Your customer can import CMR files to make your catalog of products available to the customerâ€™s employees. For more information, see [Key tasks: Create and maintain your product catalog](key-tasks-create-and-maintain-your-product-catalog.md).

## Maintain your users

You can request to add or delete your employees from the list of users who have access to the Vendor portal. For more information, see [Add and maintain your users](add-and-maintain-your-users.md). You can also request a change in the role of an existing user to expand or reduce the activities that are permitted for the user. For more information, see [Maintain your contacts](maintain-your-contacts.md).

## Request to be added to procurement categories

The customer classifies the products that they purchase into procurement categories. When your customer approved you as a vendor, they authorized you to provide products in specific procurement categories. You can request authorization to provide products in additional procurement categories. For more information, see [Manage your category assignments](manage-your-category-assignments.md).

## Respond to questionnaires

The customer may use questionnaires to ensure that your organization complies with procurement requirements. You can view and complete questionnaires in the Vendor portal. For more information, see [View and respond to questionnaires](view-and-respond-to-questionnaires.md).

## View notifications from the customer

In your vendor profile, you can elect to receive notification messages via the Vendor portal. If a notification has a document attached to it, you can open the attachment from the notification list. For more information, see [View notifications](view-notifications.md).
