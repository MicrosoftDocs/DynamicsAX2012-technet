# (LTU) Set up VAT paid by the customer 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Under certain conditions, sales or purchase VAT is calculated and paid by the customer or vendor, if the customer or vendor is registered in Lithuania as a VAT payer. These conditions include:

  - The company is buying or selling wood and woodenwares, such as logs, planks, or beams.

  - The company is buying or selling ferrous/non-ferrous items or products, including waste or debris.

  - The company is bankrupt.

When the sales and purchase orders are marked as **Not in invoice** in the **Sales tax codes setup** form, the VAT paid by the customer is excluded from the tax calculated in the invoice register reports. The sales invoice register (FR0672) and the purchase invoice register (FR0671) reports are modified to display the amount of VAT paid by the customer (reverse charge VAT case) and the VAT that pertains to purchase and sales orders issued by United VAT companies.
