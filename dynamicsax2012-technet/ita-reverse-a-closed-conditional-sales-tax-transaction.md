# (ITA) Reverse a closed conditional sales tax transaction 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Sales tax is paid on conditional sales transactions when an invoice is settled, not when the invoice is posted. For invoices that are not fully settled with a single payment, you must report and pay sales tax only on the amounts that are settled. You can reverse a conditional sales tax transaction only during the fiscal month in which it was created.

You must create a sales tax group, sales tax code, item sales tax group, and settlement period for conditional sales tax transactions. For more information, see [Set up conditional sales taxes](set-up-conditional-sales-taxes.md).

You can post a free text invoice, settle the payment for the invoice, and then calculate the sales tax payment for the conditional sales tax transaction.

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Free text invoices** \> **All free text invoices**.
