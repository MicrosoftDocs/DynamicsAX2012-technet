# (HUN) Set up and generate an itemized VAT statement

This statement contains details about the completed VAT transactions and can be generated for individual invoices.

## 1\. Configure settings to generate itemized VAT statements

Before you can generate an itemized VAT statement, you will need to enable Microsoft Dynamics AX to do so. You can begin by setting up parameters in the **General ledger parameters** form.

To configure the settings to generate itemized VAT statements, follow these steps:

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **General ledger parameters**.

2.  In the **General ledger parameters** form, in the **Sales tax** area, on the **VAT statement** FastTab, select the **Enable to print itemized VAT statement** check box.

3.  In the **Itemized VAT statement limit (HUF)** field, enter an amount limit, in Hungarian Forints, that determines which invoice transactions are included on the itemized VAT statement. An invoice with a total amount that exceeds this value requires an itemized VAT statement.

## 2\. Define a settlement period for VAT reporting

You can define a settlement period that determines which invoice transactions are included on the itemized VAT statement. You can customize your settlement period based on your companyâ€™s requirements for VAT reporting.

To define a settlement period for VAT reporting, follow these steps:

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **Sales tax** \> **Sales tax settlement periods**.

2.  On the **General** FastTab, in the **Period interval** field, select the unit to use to specify the duration of the settlement period.

3.  In the **Number of units** field, enter the number of units for the period that you want to report.

4.  On the **Periods** FastTab, click **Add**.

5.  In the **From date** and **To date** fields, enter the starting date and ending date of the settlement period.

For more information about defining a settlement period, see [Set up a sales tax settlement period](set-up-a-sales-tax-settlement-period.md).

## 3\. Generate and export the itemized VAT statement

You can now generate the itemized VAT statement. After you generate the statement, you can verify the items, print the report, and then export the report file for processing.

To generate and export the itemized VAT statement, follow these steps:

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Periodic** \> **VAT reporting**.

2.  In the **Date** field, enter the date to display the itemized VAT details for the specified settlement period.

3.  In the **Settlement period** field, enter the settlement period that you want to generate the report for.

4.  Click **Create report**.

5.  In the **Sales tax declaration information** form, in the **Run mode** field, select **Amounts in company currency for accounting** to print the itemized VAT statement.

6.  Select the **Generate file** check box to indicate that you want to create an export file for the itemized VAT statement.

7.  In the **File name** field, enter the file name and path to save the export file, and then click **OK**.

8.  After you save the export file, click **Print report**.

9.  In the **Sales tax declaration information** form, click **OK**. The report is printed and exported.
