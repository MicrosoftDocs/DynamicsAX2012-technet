The **Cash payment receipt** register is created to combine cash inflow information for an enterprise in order to affiliate income that equally relates to current and future periods and vouchers that define the amount of future expenses.

You must set up account interval groups, create expense or income codes, and set up ledger accounts for the expense or income codes.
