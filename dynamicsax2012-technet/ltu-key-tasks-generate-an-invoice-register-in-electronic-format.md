# (LTU) Key tasks: Generate an invoice register in electronic format 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can generate information for reporting value-added (VAT) transactions to tax authorities. You can generate a list of customer invoices that contain VAT for reporting on Form FR0672. Also, you can generate a list of vendor invoices that contain VAT for reporting on Form FR0671. You can generate these lists, also referred to as registers, in an XML format that you can send electronically to the tax authorities.

**Prerequisites**

Before you can generate an invoice register, you must do the following:

  - Set up a number sequence for the various types of customer invoices that are available in Microsoft Dynamics AX. You can specify whether a type of invoice is included in the customer invoice register. For example, you can exclude free-text invoices and customer invoices that were created for projects. For more information about how to set up number sequences for customer invoices that you want to include in an invoice register, see [(LTU) Counters management (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj911249\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Set up a number sequence for the various types of vendor invoices that are available in Microsoft Dynamics AX. You can specify whether a type of invoice is included in the vendor invoice register. For example, you can exclude purchase advance invoices and vendor invoices that were posted for projects. For more information about how to set up number sequences for vendor invoices that you want to include in an invoice register, see [(LTU) Counters management (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj911249\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Set up the system to track customer invoices and vendor invoices that contain VAT amounts. For more information about how to set up tracking for customer invoices, see [Accounts receivable parameters (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa576993\(v=ax.60\)). For more information about how to set up tracking for vendor invoices, see [(LTU) Accounts payable parameters (modified form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj665154\(v=ax.60\)).
