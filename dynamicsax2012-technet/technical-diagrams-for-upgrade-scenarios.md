<td><p>This diagram illustrates the recommended procedure for “in-place” upgrade to Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 from either Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 or Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack. By performing most of the development and testing tasks on non-production computers, you minimize the effect of the upgrade on your production system. You work with a total of three Microsoft Dynamics AX installations: your production system, which is the basis for the other two installations, a test system, and a development system that is used to upgrade customized code. The systems are color-coded to emphasize where you are working at any given stage of the upgrade.</p></td>

2.  On the **File** menu, click **Page Setup**.

3.  On the **Print Setup** tab, in the **Printer paper** section, select the size of paper to print on.

4.  On the **Print Setup** tab, in the **Print zoom** section, click **Fit to**, and then enter **1 sheet across by 1 sheet down**.

5.  On the **Page Size** tab, click **Size to fit drawing contents**, and then click **OK**.
