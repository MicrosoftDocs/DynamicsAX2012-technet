# Review a submitted project budget or budget revision [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

After an original project budget is submitted for approval, the worker who is assigned the step of approving the budget receives a notification that the budget is ready for review. The reviewer can approve or reject the budget, or delegate the approval permission to another worker. The same process occurs when a project budget revision is submitted for approval. Each budget revision submittal must be reviewed individually and has its own workflow cycle.

In Project management and accounting, you must be assigned as an approver to approve budgets, budget revisions, or timesheets.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Only the entire original project budget or budget revision is submitted and then reviewed, rejected, or approved. These tasks cannot be performed on the original project budget subsections.</P>
