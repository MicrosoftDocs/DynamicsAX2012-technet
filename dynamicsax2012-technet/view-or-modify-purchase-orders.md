# View or modify purchase orders 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use the **All purchase orders**, **View purchase order**, and **Order line information** pages to view information about the purchase orders created for items that are ordered. Purchase orders indicate the type, quantities, and prices for products or services that you order from vendors.

When you view purchase orders, you can view the status. The status indicates how far the order has progressed in the purchase order cycle:

  - **Open order** – The purchase order was created.

  - **Delivered** – All order lines have been delivered by the vendor.

  - **Invoiced** – All order lines have been paid.

  - **Canceled** – All line items have been returned, and a credit note has been updated and closed.

You can also use the **Edit purchase order** page to modify purchase orders.
