# Loyalty programs 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

Loyalty programs can help increase customer loyalty by rewarding customers for buying products in your retail stores. In Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can set up simple or complex loyalty programs that apply across your legal entities in any retail channel. This topic describes the components that are included in the loyalty program for Retail and provides information about the tasks that are required to configure the loyalty program for your organization.

## Get to know the loyalty feature

The loyalty feature lets you specify the types of rewards that you offer your customers. You can offer additional incentives to customers who spend more in your stores and you can also set up the rules that apply to the earning and redemption of those rewards and how those rules apply to your customer’s activities. The following table lists resources that you can use to learn more about the loyalty feature.

## Configure loyalty programs

To offer a loyalty program to your customers and to issue and apply loyalty points to retail transactions in Microsoft Dynamics AX, you must set up the various components that the loyalty feature requires. The following tables describe the configuration tasks that must be completed in Microsoft Dynamics AX to set up the loyalty feature.

## Prerequisites

<colgroup>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Set up discounts</p></td>
<td><p>Loyalty reward offers often consist of discounts that you offer your customers. To determine which discounts you want to include in a loyalty program, you must set up the discount and then assign it to a price group. The price group is then either assigned to a loyalty program or a reward level (tier) within a loyalty program.</p>
<div class="alert">

> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you set up your loyalty programs to offer only loyalty points, setting up discounts and price groups for loyalty programs is optional.</P>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Set up price groups</p></td>
<td><p>You can use price groups to group prices and discounts and apply them to retail products. To apply special discounts to your loyalty programs, you must first add the discounts to a price group and then assign the price group to either a loyalty program or to a specific loyalty program tier.</p>
<p>For example, a gold loyalty tier customer might be eligible for additional discounts. To apply those discounts to gold tier customers only, you would set up a price group that includes the discounts that apply to gold tier members.</p></td>

<td><p>To allow customers to redeem loyalty reward points for products in your stores you must complete two tasks. First, set up a loyalty type payment method. Then, assign the loyalty payment method to the retail channels that are participating in the loyalty program. The second step identifies the loyalty card as a valid form of payment.</p></td>

## Maintain loyalty programs

After you set up loyalty programs, you can monitor and maintain them and review the activity of your cardholders. You can continue to offer rewards to your customers based on their level of activity and you can manually adjust a customer’s loyalty rewards if necessary.

The following tables describe the tasks in Microsoft Dynamics AX that you perform to maintain the loyalty feature.

## Upgrade loyalty programs from earlier versions

In earlier versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX, you could use the same loyalty scheme ID and loyalty card numbers to represent different loyalty programs in different legal entities in your organization. However, in AX 2012 R3, the loyalty scheme ID and card numbers must be unique. Conflicts in duplicate scheme IDs are automatically resolved during the upgrade process, but you must manually review loyalty card numbers after the upgrade and resolve any duplicates.

The following table describes the task in Microsoft Dynamics AX to upgrade the loyalty feature.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

<td><p>Manually resolve conflicts in loyalty card numbers. We recommend that you resolve any conflicts before you process any loyalty transactions for new or existing customers.</p></td>

## Support for earlier versions

In AX 2012 R3, the loyalty feature has been redesigned. Loyalty programs and loyalty rewards were introduced, and loyalty schemes were redesigned to work with the loyalty programs. Also, the concept of loyalty customers was deprecated. In addition, in earlier versions of Retail, the loyalty feature recognized only one loyalty scheme and one type of loyalty point.

When you upgraded from an earlier version of Retail to the current version, in earlier versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 for Retail, after the main system upgrade was complete, all Microsoft Dynamics AX for Retail POS registers had to be upgraded at the same time to maintain data connectivity. In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, new functionality was introduced that lets an earlier version of Retail POS communicate with the current version of Retail POS.

All POS registers in a specific retail channel must use the same version of Microsoft Dynamics AX. However, by using the new upgrade functionality, loyalty transactions from registers that are still using an earlier version of Microsoft Dynamics AX can be sent to headquarters as you work to upgrade all your retail stores.

If backward compatibility mode is enabled for Microsoft Dynamics AX, the following loyalty options are not available on registers that are using an earlier version of Retail. Also, if you try to use any of these features in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client, a warning message is displayed.

  - Adding loyalty program tiers to earning rules

  - Adding the sales transaction count activity type to earning rules

  - Adding loyalty program tiers to redemption rules

  - Adding categories, products, or product variants to redemption rules

  - Adding the **Payment by quantity** redemption type to redemption rules

  - Using non-redeemable reward points in earning or redemption rules

  - Deleting redemption rules in a valid period

  - Associating more than one reward point ID to one loyalty scheme

  - Associating more than one loyalty scheme with one loyalty program

  - Creating program tiers for loyalty programs

  - Associating more than one loyalty program with one loyalty card


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Follow these steps to determine whether backward compatibility mode is enabled for your system. Click <STRONG>System administration</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Setup</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Licensing</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>License configuration</STRONG>. In the <STRONG>License configuration</STRONG> form, expand the <STRONG>Retail</STRONG> node, and then expand the <STRONG>Retail scheduler</STRONG> node.</P>
> <P>If the <STRONG>Retail Commerce Data Exchange backward compatibility</STRONG> check box is selected, backward compatibility mode is enabled.</P>
