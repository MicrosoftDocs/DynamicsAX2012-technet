# About internal controls reports 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use internal controls report views to gather, analyze, and summarize document statistics in a variety of ways. You can also open documents when you are in a report view. The report view that you select determines how the information is displayed. The following options are available:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Report view</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Data Grid</strong></p></td>
<td><p>All documents are displayed in a table.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>By Control Effectiveness</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Control documents are grouped first by the ratings that are assigned to the effectiveness of the document and then by location in the hierarchy.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>By Assignee</strong></p></td>
<td><p>All documents are grouped first by assignee and then by location in the hierarchy.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>By Document Type</strong></p></td>
<td><p>All documents are grouped first by document type and then by status.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>By Location</strong></p></td>
<td><p>All documents are grouped first by location and then by status.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>By Workflow Step</strong></p></td>
<td><p>All documents are grouped first by document type and then by current workflow step.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


You can create additional shared or personal report views by using standard Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 functionality. You can also export the report data to Microsoft Excel from any of the views.
