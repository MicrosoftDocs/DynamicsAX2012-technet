# (BRA) Create and post a vendor payment journal with a default description for withholding tax, interest, and fine payments 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use the **Journal voucher** form to create and post a journal that has a default description for withholding tax, interest, and fine payments that are made to a vendor. You can also use a payment proposal to post a vendor payment that includes a default description. When you mark transactions for settlement or transfer payment proposal lines, the transaction type is identified by using the default descriptions, and the corresponding transaction text that you set up for the transactions is updated in the ledger. For withholding tax, interest, and fine payments, the transactions are updated with the transaction text that is set up for the **Vendor - withholding tax**, **Vendor - interest**, and **Vendor - fine** descriptions. For payment proposals, the transactions are updated with the transaction text that is set up for the **Vendor - payment, vendor** description.

You must specify a journal description before you post a journal. When you post a journal, the %1, %3, %4, and %7 variables that are used in the journal description are replaced with the payment date, voucher number, account number, and account name. If the %2, %5, and %6 variables are used in the journal description, they are replaced with blank spaces. For more information, see [(BRA) Set up journal descriptions for withholding tax, interest, and fine payments](bra-set-up-journal-descriptions-for-withholding-tax-interest-and-fine-payments.md). After you post a journal, you can generate the day book and analytical ledger reports that contain the transaction text for the withholding tax, interest, and fine payments.
