_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Notification messages may be sent to you when workflow-related events occur. For example, notifications may be sent to you when a document is assigned to you for approval, or when a document that you submitted has completed the workflow process. Use the following steps to specify how you want to receive workflow notifications.

1.  Click **Home** on the top link bar, and then click **Workflow options** on the Quick Launch. The **Workflow options** page is displayed.

2.  To modify the options on this page, click **Actions** \> **Edit workflow options**.

3.  To receive workflow notifications by email, select the **Send notifications in email** check box.

4.  Specify how you want to receive line-item workflow notifications. Select one of the following options from the **Line-item notification type** list:
    
      - **Grouped** — Line-item notifications will be grouped into a single notification.
    
      - **Individual** — Receive a notification for each line item.

5.  Click **OK**.
