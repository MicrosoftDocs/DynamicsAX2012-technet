_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can expand bills of materials (BOMs) from the sales order to manage package price offers.

## Example

You are selling a package of items for a set price. The customer can choose three items from a range of four possible choices. The three items that the customer chooses must appear on the invoice that the customer receives. To accomplish this, select the **Mark** check box for each of the three items, and then click **OK**.
