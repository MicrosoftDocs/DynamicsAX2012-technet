2.  Select a fiscal calendar, if one is not already specified for the ledger.

3.  Click **Ledger calendar**.

4.  In the left pane, select the fiscal year that includes the period that you want to put on hold.

5.  On the **Periods** FastTab, select the period that you want to put on hold.

6.  On the **Module access level** FastTab, select the name of the module for which you want to put the period on hold.

7.  In the **Access level** column, perform one of the following actions:
    
      - To change the status so that no users can make updates for the selected period, select **None**.
    
      - To change the status so that only a specific group can make updates for the selected period, select **User group**, and then select a group in the **User group** column.
