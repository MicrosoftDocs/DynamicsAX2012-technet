## Sell a gift card

You can sell gift cards from the online store, in brick-and-mortar stores by using the point-of-sale (POS) system, or from a call center. The following procedure describes how to sell a gift card in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 Call center. For information about how to sell gift cards in a brick-and-mortar store, see the topic “Issue a gift card” in the Microsoft Dynamics AX for Retail POS help. To sell a gift card in an online store, search for a gift card product in the online store, and then follow the checkout instructions in the online store.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Before you can sell gift cards in any retail channel, gift cards must be set up in Microsoft Dynamics AX. For more information about how to set up gift cards, see <A href="set-up-gift-cards.md">Set up gift cards</A>.</P>



To sell a gift card in the call center, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Call center** \> **Common** \> **All sales orders**.

2.  On the **Action Pane**, in the **New** group, click **Sales order**, and then enter customer information and click **OK**.

3.  In the **Sales order** form, on the **Sales order lines** FastTab, in the **Item number** field, enter the item number of the gift card. Then select the site and warehouse for the gift card and enter an amount in the **Unit price** field. You must enter information in the **Site** and **Warehouse** fields for both physical gift cards and electronic gift cards.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can enter only one gift card per sales order line.</P>
    > <P>For legal entities whose primary address is in Russia, you must select the site and warehouse for the gift card and the field amount in the sales order line must be equal to 0.</P>



4.  On the **Line details** FastTab, click the **Packing** tab. In the **Gift card** section, in the **Gift card type** field, select whether the gift card is a physical gift card or an electronic gift card, and then do one of the following:
    
      - For a physical gift card, select **Physical card** as the gift card type and enter the recipient’s name. Then in the **Gift card number** field, enter the gift card number that is printed on the card.
    
      - For an electronic gift card, select **Email** as the gift card type. Then enter the customer's name and email address and the recipient’s name and email address.
        
        The card number for electronic gift cards is generated when the sales order is invoiced by using the serial number template that is defined in the **Retail parameters** form. The card number and gift card details are emailed to the recipient.
