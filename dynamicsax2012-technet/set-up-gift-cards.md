# Set up gift cards 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

This topic explains how to set up retail gift cards that can be issued at one store and redeemed at any store in your organization. At the point of sale (POS), cashiers can accept a gift card as payment, see the balance on a gift card, issue a gift card, and add money to a gift card.

This topic explains how to set up gift cards in Microsoft Dynamics AX. You must purchase the physical gift cards separately. Also, we recommend that you evaluate the legal and tax requirements in your area before you set up gift cards for your organization.

## Set up gift cards

To set up gift cards, follow these steps:

1.  Set up a retail service product to represent gift cards. For more information about how to set up products, see [Set up retail products](set-up-retail-products.md).
    
    If your gift cards have bar codes, make sure that the correct bar codes are associated with the gift card product. For more information about how to set up bar codes, see [Setting up bar codes](setting-up-bar-codes.md).

2.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Parameters** \> **Retail parameters**.

3.  In the **Retail parameters** form, in the left pane, click **Posting**, and then, in the **Gift card product** field, select the gift card product.

4.  Set up at least one gift card payment method. For more information about how to set up payment methods, see [Setting up payment methods (Retail)](setting-up-payment-methods-retail.md).

After you set up gift cards, you can add gift card operations to Microsoft Dynamics AX for Retail POS screen layouts to make it easier for cashiers to work with gift cards. For information about how to set up screen layouts, see [Setting up screen layouts](setting-up-screen-layouts.md).

1.  Set up a retail service product to represent gift cards. For more information about how to set up products, see [Set up retail products](set-up-retail-products.md).

      - If your organization supports gift card transaction only within the same legal entity, select the same legal entity that you are setting up retail parameters for.
    
      - If your organization supports gift card transactions across legal entities, and the legal entity that you are setting up retail parameters for holds the liability for the gift card transactions, select the same legal entity.
    
      - If your organization supports gift card transactions across legal entities, and the legal entity that you are setting up retail parameters for does not hold the liability for the gift card transactions, select the legal entity that does hold the gift card transaction liability.

5.  In the **Journal** field, enter the name of the journal to use when intercompany journal entries are created. Journal entries are creating during the statement posting process.

6.  In the **Void journal name** field, enter the name of the journal to use when a journal entry to void a gift card is created.

7.  In the **Serial number templates** fields, enter the start date, end date, and gift card numbering template to use when generating electronic gift cards. If the gift card template doesn’t expire, leave the **End date** field blank.
