# (HUN) Set up parameters for the EU sales and purchases list 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can set up parameters in Microsoft Dynamics AX that enable you to generate an EU sales list that reports sales that have been made to VAT-registered entities in other European Union (EU) member states. In some cases, you can generate an EU sales list that reports purchases made from these entities.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>For more information about how to create and submit the EU sales list, see <A href="generate-the-eu-sales-list.md">Generate the EU sales list</A>.</P>



Use the procedures below to set up parameters for the EU sales and purchase lists.

2.  In the left pane, click **Sales tax**.
