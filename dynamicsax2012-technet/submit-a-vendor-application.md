# Submit a vendor application 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You received an email message that invites you to submit an application to become an approved vendor for an organization. If you want to become a vendor for the organization, the first step is to submit the application. The organization evaluates the information that you submit. If your application is approved, you receive a notification that tells you what legal entities and procurement categories at the organization you are allowed to do business in.

1.  Click **Home**, and then click **Prospective vendor registration** on the Quick Launch.

2.  On the **Vendor registration** page, click **Edit**.

3.  On the **Business information** tab, enter information about your company, such as address details and the currency that is used by your company.

4.  Optional: You can also enter the following information:
    
      - On the **Contact information** tab, enter details about the primary business contact for your company.
    
      - On the **Bank information** tab, enter bank details for electronic payments that the customer makes to you.
    
      - On the **Category information** tab, select the customer’s procurement categories in which you want to provide products.

5.  Fill out any questionnaires that are associated with the vendor application.

6.  When you have finished, click **Save and close**.

7.  Click **Submit**.

Your vendor application is routed for approval.

The reviewer evaluates the application that you submit and reviews any attached questionnaires. If the reviewer approves the request, your company is added as a vendor in the procurement categories and legal entities that the reviewer approved.

At the end of the review process, you are notified whether your application has been approved or rejected. If your application is approved, you are authorized to do business in the approved procurement categories and legal entities. If your application is rejected, you can provide additional information and resubmit the application.
