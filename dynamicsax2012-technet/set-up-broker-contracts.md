# Set up broker contracts 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to set up a broker contract that specifies the commission that a broker vendor receives for the sale of items or groups of items. For example, you might have a contract with a broker that states that every time a specific model of television is sold, the broker receives a percentage of the sales price. Commissions can be calculated based on a fixed amount, a percentage, or an amount per unit.

## Prerequisites

Before you set up a broker contract, you must enable price details in sales orders and purchase orders. For more information, see [Enable price details on orders](enable-price-details-on-orders.md).

## 1\. Set up a broker contract

Use this procedure to set up a broker contract. You can define a contract based on a single item, an item group, or all items. When a worker creates a sales order, a broker contract can be assigned to the sales order as necessary.

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Common** \> **Broker** \> **Broker contracts**.

2.  In the **Broker contracts** form, click **Create a new record**, and in the **Broker contract ID** field, enter a contract ID.

3.  In the **Description** field, enter a brief description of the contract and then, in the **Broker vendor account** field, select the account number for the broker.

4.  Select the start date and end date of the broker contract, and then, in the **Charges code** field, select the charge code to be applied to the contract.

5.  In the **Category** field, select whether the contact is based on a per-unit amount, a percentage of the sales price, or a fixed amount.

6.  In the **Charges value** field, enter the percentage or amount that the broker will receive and then, in the **Charges currency code** field, select the currency in which the broker is paid.

## 2\. Add lines to a broker contract

Use this procedure to add items to a broker contract.

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Common** \> **Broker** \> **Broker contracts**.

2.  In the **Broker contracts** form, select the contract to add lines to, and in the **Contract details** pane, click **Add line**.

3.  In the **Item code** field, select how items are added to the broker contract:
    
      - **Table** – The broker contract applies to a single item.
    
      - **Group** – The broker contract applies to an item group.
    
      - **All** – The broker contract applies to all items.

4.  If you selected **Table** or **Group** in the **Item relation** field, select the appropriate item or item group.

5.  In the **Account code** field, select the customer groups to which this contract will be applied, and then select the appropriate customer information in the **Account selection** field.

6.  In the **Charges code** field, select the charge code to be applied and then, in the **Break type** field, select whether the agreement is based on unit quantity or unit cost.

7.  In the **Break** field, enter the agreement amount or quantity for the selected break type.

8.  In the **Category** field, select the value that will be used to calculate the fee and then, in the **Charges value** field enter the percentage or amount that the broker will receive.

9.  In the **Sales tax group** field, select the appropriate sales tax group, and then, in the **Charges currency code** field, select the currency for the contract line.

10. In the **Broker contracts** pane, in the **Status** field, select **Approved**.
