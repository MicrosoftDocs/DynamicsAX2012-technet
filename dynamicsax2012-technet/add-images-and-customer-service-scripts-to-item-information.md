# Add images and customer service scripts to item information 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to add images and scripts for customer service representatives to use when they sell an item through a call center. This information is included in the item record that the customer service representative sees when he or she talks to a customer.

## Prerequisites

The following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you start.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Category</p></th>
<th><p>Prerequisite</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Related setup task</p></td>
<td><p>Set up up-sell/cross-sell.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Add an image to an item record

Use this procedure to add an image to an item record.

1.  Click **Product information management** \> **Common** \> **Released products**.

2.  Select the item to add the image to, and on the **Action Pane**, on the **Product** tab, click **Edit**.

3.  In the **Released product details** form, on the **Action Pane**, on the **Product** tab, in the **Set up** group, click **Product image**.

4.  In the form that opens, click **New**.

5.  In the **Type** field, select the file type and then enter a brief description of the file contents. For example, file type might be .jpg or a URL, and the description might be *Premium bicycle helmet - Adult*.

6.  In the **Media usage** field, select whether the image is to be used internally or externally to the organization.

7.  Select the **Default image** check box to indicate that the image that you added is the default image for the item.

## Add a customer service script or note to an item record

Use this procedure to add one or more scripts or notes to an item record. Scripts can be used by a customer service representative when referencing or selling an item to a customer. Notes are intended to be read by the customer service representative only, whereas scripts are intended to be spoken by the customer service representative to the customer.

1.  Click **Product information management** \> **Common** \> **Released products**..

2.  Select the item to add the script to, and on the **Action Pane**, on the **Product** tab, click **Edit**.

3.  In the **Released product details** form, on the **Action Pane**, on the **Scripts** tab, click **Scripts**.

4.  In the **Scripts** form, click **New**, and in the **Category** field, select the product category of the item.

5.  In the **Priority** field, enter the priority in which the message will show.
    
    For example, if you add three scripts to an item, you might assign a priority of 1 to the first script, 2 to the second, and 3 to the third script. When a customer service representative views the scripts, the script with a priority 1 is first in the list of scripts.

6.  Select the **Active** check box to activate the script, and in the **Type** field, select whether you are adding a note or a script.

7.  In the **Script name** field, select the script. The text of the script will appear in the **Text** field.
