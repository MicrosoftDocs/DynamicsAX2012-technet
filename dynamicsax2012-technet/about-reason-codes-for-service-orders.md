# About reason codes for service orders 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, you can use reason codes to help explain the status of a service order when the stage of a service order is updated. For example, if you cancel a service order, you can select a reason code for the cancellation.

To view information about reason codes that are used to track the progress of service orders, run the Service order progress report. This report lists all service orders, regardless of their stage, and the reason codes that are specified when a service order stage is updated.

## Turn reason codes on or off

Reason codes are optional. You can decide whether to require a reason code when you update a service order to a specific service stage.

1.  Click **Service management** \> **Setup** \> **Service orders** \> **Service stages**.

2.  In the **Service stages** form, select a service stage, and then select the **Reason** check box for the service stage.

3.  Close the form to save your changes.
