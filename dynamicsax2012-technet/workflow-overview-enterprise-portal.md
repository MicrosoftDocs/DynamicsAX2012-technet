# Workflow overview (Enterprise Portal) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A *workflow* represents a business process. It defines how a document flows through the system by showing who must complete a task, make a decision, or approve a document. For example, consider the following illustration of an expense report workflow.

![Workflow with elements that are assigned to users](images/Gg751362.Workflow_User(AX.60).gif "Workflow with elements that are assigned to users")

To better understand this workflow, suppose that Sam submits an expense report for $7,000. In this scenario, Ivan must review the receipts that Sam routed to him. Then Frank and Sue must approve the expense report.

Now suppose that Sam submits an expense report for $11,000. In this scenario, Ivan must review the receipts, and Frank, Sue, and Ann must approve the expense report.

Workflows are configured in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client. However, you can use Enterprise Portal to complete workflow-related tasks, such as:

  - Submit a document to the workflow system for processing.

  - Complete a task related to the document that was submitted for processing.

  - Approve a document.

  - Make a decision that determines the next step of the workflow.
