# (BRA) Create a quotation 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can create a quotation by specifying fiscal information, such as the operation type and the Código Fiscal de Operações E Prestações (CFOP) code.

When you create a quotation line, you can select a CFOP code in the **CFOP** field. The CFOP codes that are available in this field depend on the fiscal establishment of the site that you selected in the **Site** field. The tax groups in the **Sales tax group** and **Item sales tax group** fields are also updated based on the tax matrix.

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Common** \> **Sales quotations** \> **All quotations**.

2.  Create a quotation.

3.  Click **Header view**, and then click the **Fiscal information** FastTab.

4.  In the **Operation type** field, select the operation type for the sales quotation.

5.  Select the **Final user** check box to indicate that the customer is the final user. If you select this check box, the Imposto Sobre Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços (ICMS) tax includes the Imposto Sobre Produtos Industrializados (IPI) tax and any freight charges.

6.  Click **Line view**, and then create a quotation line.

7.  In the **Lines** grid, in the **Site** field, select the site for the quotation line. The tax groups in the **Sales tax group** and **Item sales tax group** fields on the **Setup** tab on the **Line details** FastTab are updated based on the tax matrix. You can also select different tax groups.
