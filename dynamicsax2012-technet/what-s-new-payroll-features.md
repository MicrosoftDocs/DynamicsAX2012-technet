# What's new: Payroll features 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Payroll processing was redesigned in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 and now provides a more consistent user interface. Additionally, setup and data entry have been simplified.

## What’s new in AX 2012 R2

## New functionality

Payroll now handles mandatory deductions for garnishments (such as child support orders) and tax levies. When there is more than one garnishment order for a worker, the calculation sequences make sure that each garnishment is handled correctly, and that the combined deductions are not more than the amount that is legally allowed.

Before you can generate pay by using Payroll, positions must be assigned to workers. Position settings are used to control how earnings are generated. These settings are also used for workers’ compensation, general liability insurance, and unions.

Many payroll settings are now date effective. The date-effective settings make it easier to maintain data for which changes must be tracked at different times. For example, if a worker notifies you that her residence will change in a month, you can enter the future-dated change immediately. The current residency information is used until the effective date that you set up for the new information, and then the new information is automatically used.

## Special considerations

Payroll data and settings from Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009 can be migrated to Payroll for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. Due to the wide range of enhancements, many new settings must be configured before you can run payroll for the first time after migration.

Benefits and deductions have changed extensively from AX 2009. Benefit setup and the determination of eligibility for benefits are both handled in Human resources. Setup for deductions and contributions is performed in Payroll. Workers can be enrolled in benefits from either Human resources or Payroll.

The processes for posting payroll and issuing worker payments are now separate. Additionally, some terms that were used in AX 2009 have changed in AX 2012 so that they better match standard usage in the payroll industry.

<p>By using earning codes that have a rate basis of regular rate of pay to calculate and pay overtime premiums (instead of a standard 1.5x or 2.0x overtime code), the premium calculation will be made according to FLSA rules.</p>
