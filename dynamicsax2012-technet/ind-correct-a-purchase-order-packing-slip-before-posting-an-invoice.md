3.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Manage** tab, click **Packing slip journal**.

4.  In the **Packing slip journal** form, select the packing slip record and then click **Correction**.

5.  In the **Correct packing slip – Packing slip %1, %2** form, in the **Update** field, enter the new quantity. Click **OK**.

      - The original quantity and tax amount
    
      - The reversed quantity and tax amount
