_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can create a partial storno transaction by specifying a negative receipt quantity according to the inventory dimension value of an item.

3.  Select a transfer order that has a transfer status of **Received**.

4.  Click **Posting** \> **Receive** to open the **Receive** form. By default, the **Credit correction** check box is selected if you have selected the **Credit correction in transfer order** check box in the **Inventory and warehouse management parameters** form.

5.  In the **Update** field, select **Received quantity return**.

6.  In the **Voucher reference** field, select the receipt voucher that is generated for the selected transfer order receipt. After you select the voucher reference, the lines in the lower pane are populated with the item number and other inventory details from the referenced transaction.

7.  Select the **Edit lines** check box to modify the return quantity for an item.

8.  Select the **Explode lines** check box to modify the return quantity according to the inventory dimension of the item. This check box is available only when you select the **Edit lines** check box.

9.  In the **Receive quantity** field, modify the return quantity. The modified quantity should be negative and should not be more than the shipped quantity.

10. Select the **Edit lines** check box, and then modify the received quantity, if the quantity requires modification.

11. Click **OK** to post the receipt transaction. The following actions occur:
    
      - A voucher number is generated for the storno transaction.
    
      - The transfer status of the selected transfer order is updated to **Shipped** in the **Transfer orders** form.
    
      - The **Receive remain** value for the item is updated with the returned quantity in the **Transfer orders** form.

12. Click **Inventory management** \> **Inquiries** \> **Transfer orders** \> **Transfer order history**.

13. In the **Transfer order history** form, view the storno inventory transactions. If the **Credit correction** check box is cleared when you post the transfer order, only the **Goods return** check box is selected.

14. Close the **Transfer order history** form.

15. In the **Transfer orders** form, click **Inventory** \> **Transactions** to open the **Inventory transactions** form. You can view the receipt transactions and return transactions for the selected item.
