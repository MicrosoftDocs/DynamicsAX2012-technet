# (RUS) Set up accounts payable parameters for amount differences 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use the **Accounts payable parameters** form to set up accounts payable parameters for amount differences. Facture amount differences are included in a separate list that is created in the purchase book for the specified period. This list contains the cancellation of the source facture and the new facture that is recalculated at payment.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If more than one payment is made during a tax period, the recalculated facture amount is the total of the recalculated payments. If all of the payments belong to the same tax period that the invoice belongs to, the total facture is reflected in the purchase book.</P>



1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Setup** \> **Accounts payable parameters**.

2.  Click the **Ledger and sales tax** link.

3.  On the **Purchase book** FastTab, select the **Amount difference in additional list** check box to include the amount differences in an additional list in the purchase book.
