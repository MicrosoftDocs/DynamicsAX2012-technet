# (RUS) Set up sales tax codes for customer advance payment 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Each sales tax code is characterized by the following criteria:

  - Tax type

  - Basis for adding tax

  - Tax rate or amount

  - Period of validity

  - Account posting rules

You can set the posting rules by specifying a ledger posting group for the sales tax code. Within the Posting groups directory, the ledger accounts are set up to create tax accounting transactions for a specified tax code.

The sales tax codes are grouped into sales tax groups (TG) and item sales tax groups (ITG). When you execute a purchase or sales voucher, you must specify the appropriate TG or ITG. The taxes (sales tax codes) that are included in both TG and ITG are calculated. When you post the voucher, the relevant accounting transactions are created.
