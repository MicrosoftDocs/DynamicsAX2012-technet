# What's new: Country-specific features for China (CHN) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, we changed and added country-specific functionality for China. This topic is divided into two sections. The first section outlines the key features that have a broad impact on Chinese installations, such as features that affect General ledger, tax integration with the Chinese Golden Tax System (GTS), Inventory and product management, and reporting. The second section describes additional changes to country-specific functionality for China. For more information about specific features for China, see [TechNet Library for Application Users - China](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=299906).

## New functionality

The following features were added to comply with Chinese accounting and regulatory requirements:

  - Define a hierarchical structure for a chart of accounts.

  - Use financial dimensions to allocate and post transactions to ledger accounts, bank reconciliation journals, and the Chinese voucher system.

  - Voucher types and Chinese voucher numbers are implemented in source documents, reports, and queries.

  - Subledger journal entries are created for most transactions. Use the subledger journal to view a summary of transaction amounts before the transaction is posted to the general ledger.

  - Inventory reports provide details about inventory transactions and balances.

  - Define parameters and XML files for the GB/T 24589-2010 report.

## Comparison with Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009

These features have changed considerably since AX 2009. Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 includes changes to the following areas:

  - General ledger

  - Tax integration with the Chinese Golden Tax System

  - Inventory and product management

  - Reporting

<td><p>Tax integration for China</p></td>
<td><p>VAT registration numbers can now be included on customer records.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Distribution of subledger lines</p></td>
<td><p>Subledger journal lines are accounting entries that are posted to the general ledger by using the General journal. You can generate subledgers from source documents such as invoices, packing slips, and picking lists for customers and vendors. Before you post the voucher information to the general ledger, you can view or modify subledger journals by using a new method that is named distribution. This method lets you allocate posting amounts among multiple financial dimensions. This method also lets you change the default ledger account number or financial dimension values, based on user permissions.</p>
<p>In China, the Chinese voucher type and Chinese voucher number are implemented in the ledger entries. Chinese voucher types and Chinese voucher numbers are included in the ledger entries after the accounting distributions and subledger journal lines are posted. You can query ledger entries that have Chinese voucher types and voucher numbers by using Chinese ledger inquiries and 16 existing reports for Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services. You can also print ledger vouchers that have Chinese voucher numbers, and print Chinese financial reports that have Chinese voucher types and voucher numbers.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="chn-about-accounting-distributions-and-subledger-journals.md">(CHN) About accounting distributions and subledger journals</a>.</p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Tree structure of ledger accounts for China</p></td>
<td><p>In accordance with Chinese legislation, companies must create and maintain charts of accounts in a tree structure of hierarchical accounts by setting up multiple levels for ledger accounts. You can create account numbers in a specific format to indicate the number of levels that you can add to a ledger account. For example, to split a ledger account into two levels, you must use an account number format of xxxx-yy. Here, the first four characters denote the first level, such as a cash account, and the last two characters denote the sublevel, such as a cash account in a currency. The character that separates the various levels of the ledger account is user-defined. In this example, a hyphen (-) is used as the separator character.</p>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Ledger accounts of inventory value by site</p></td>
<td><p>In China, organizations that have more than 100 inventory items and maintain several warehouses are required to document inventory values in ledger accounts. These inventory values are organized by sites and item groups. Ledger accounts of the inventory value are categorized by the inventory sites.</p>
<p>In Microsoft Dynamics AX, a company can have multiple sites and inventory locations. You can set up or modify item postings to various ledger accounts for different sites, and you can indicate each inventory item group. You can also activate combinations of inventory transactions for sites, and then post the site details in the sales orders, purchase orders, inventory journals, or production journals. You can view the ledger accounts by the inventory value of each site in the <strong>Chart of accounts</strong> form.</p>
<p>When you post the invoices and journals, the following ledger transactions are updated:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When you post sales orders, the ledger transactions are applied to the correct accounts for packing slips and invoices.</p></li>
<li><p>When you post purchase orders, ledger transactions are applied to the correct accounts for purchase packing slips, invoices, or return orders.</p></li>
<li><p>When you post purchase orders and end production orders for inventory items of the standard cost model, the ledger account is selected based on the setup in the <strong>Posting</strong> form.</p></li>
<li><p>When you post the Inventory Movement, Profit and Loss, Bills of Materials, Item Arrival, Production Input, Physical Counting, Tag Counting, or Project Item journals, the ledger account is selected based on the setup in the <strong>Item posting</strong> form.</p></li>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Inventory summary reports for China</p></td>
<td><p>Chinese companies use the <strong>Inventory status</strong> report to view summarized inventory status. The information on this report includes the beginning quantity, receipt quantity, issued quantity, and end quantity of a specified item. The <strong>Inventory in/out status</strong> report is another frequently used inventory report that offers more details than the <strong>Inventory status</strong> report. These reports can be queried, and there is an option that lets you set the inventory dimension.</p>
<p>You can use the following reports to check the inventory movements of receipts and issues in a warehouse:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Inventory status</strong> report âˆ’ Shows the beginning quantity, in quantity, out quantity, and end quantity of inventory items for a specified period.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inventory in/out status</strong> report âˆ’ Shows the detailed <strong>In</strong>/<strong>Out</strong> status of inventory items for a specified period.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the <strong>In</strong> status displays the number of items that are received from a purchase order, production order, transfer order, and physical count, and through other input inventory transactions. The <strong>In</strong> status includes purchased in, transferred in, or produced in quantities. The <strong>Out</strong> status displays the number of items that are issued for a sales order, production order, transfer order, and physical count, and through other output inventory transactions. By using this information, you can view the detailed <strong>In</strong>/<strong>Out</strong> status of the inventory items for a specified period.</p>
<p>If a specific period is not selected, the first date of the current month is used as the starting date, and the current date is used as the ending date.</p>

<tr class="even">
<td><p>Monthly average cost for China</p></td>
<td><p>The monthly average cost method is an inventory costing method that is based on the weighted average principle. According to the weighted average principle, items that are issued from inventory are valued based on the average value of items that are received into inventory during each month of the inventory closing period. The monthly average cost method resembles the weighted average cost by date method. However, the monthly average cost method is calculated by month instead of by using a specific date.</p>
<p>The monthly average cost method is used to calculate a specific itemâ€™s weighted average cost at the end of the month. This average cost is then used to adjust the transactions for all the units of that item that were issued during the month, so that all output transactions for that item during the month have the same unit cost.</p>
<p>Only the monthly average cost from invoiced receipts is calculated, and only invoiced issue transactions are settled. Non-invoiced receipts and issue transactions are calculated and settled in the month when they are invoiced.</p>
