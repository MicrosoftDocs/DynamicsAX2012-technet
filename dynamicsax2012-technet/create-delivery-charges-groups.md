# Create delivery charges groups 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use this topic to create a charges group for modes of delivery. A delivery charges group is useful to group various modes of delivery in order to calculate and apply automatic charges, which are typically referred to as auto charges. After you create a delivery charges group, you can assign one or more modes of delivery to the group, and then you can define an auto charge and apply it to the group.

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Charges** \> **Delivery charges groups**.
    
    –or–
    
    Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Charges** \> **Delivery charges groups**.

2.  Click **New** to create a delivery charges group.

3.  In the **Charges group** field, enter a code for the charges group. The code can contain both letters and numbers.

4.  In the **Description** field, enter a description for the charges group.
