# (IND) Attach an EPCG incentive scheme to an import order 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

When you create a new purchase order to import products that meet the requirements for the Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) incentive scheme, you can assign an EPCG incentive scheme to the purchase order.

**Prerequisites**

  - Create and approve an EPCG incentive scheme. Importable items and approved vendors for the importable items are assigned to the EPCG incentive scheme during the approval process. For more information, see [(IND) Approval EPCG schemes (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj710885\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Set up import and export taxes. For more information, see [(IND) Tax codes for incentive schemes (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj664578\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Define currency exchange rates for vendor currencies. For more information, see [Currency exchange rates (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh209477\(v=ax.60\)).
