# (EEUR) Set up retail parameters for cash operations 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can set up parameters to create and post cash transactions in Retail. You can use cash payment journals, customer payment journals, or general journals to post sales transactions and payment transactions in the Retail POS. You can aggregate transactions that have the same properties when you post a statement. For more information, see [(EEUR) Set up for cash management for Retail POS](eeur-set-up-for-cash-management-for-retail-pos.md).
