# Set up shipping charges for online stores 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

In **Retail**, you can define the following types of shipping charges for online orders:

  - A fixed amount for a range of order totals. This includes free shipping for order totals above a specified amount.

  - A fixed amount for each item.

  - A charge that is provided by the shipping carrier, which you can mark up by a specified percentage.

  - A percentage of the total.

You can also define a shipping charge for a mode of delivery, a group of modes of delivery, or all modes of delivery.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Before you can specify shipping charges, you must create modes of delivery. For information, see <A href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa619881(v=ax.60)">Modes of delivery (form)</A>.</P>

2.  Click **New**, and then, in the **Level** field, select **Line**.

3.  In the **Account code** and **Customer relation** fields, do one of the following:
    
      - If you want the shipping charges to apply to a specific customer, select **Table** in the **Account code** field, and then, in the **Customer relation** field, select the customer.
    
      - If you want the shipping charges to apply to a group of customers, select **Group** in the **Account code** field, and then, in the **Customer relation** field, select the group.
    
      - If you want the shipping charges to apply to all customers, select **All** in the **Account code** field.

4.  In the **Mode of delivery code** and **Mode of delivery relation** fields, do one of the following:
    
      - If you want the shipping charges to apply to a specific mode of delivery, select **Table** in the **Mode of delivery code** field, and then, in the **Mode of delivery relation** field, select the mode of delivery.
    
      - If you want the shipping charges to apply to a group of modes of delivery, select **Group** in the **Mode of delivery code** field, and then, in the **Mode of delivery relation** field, select the group.

      - On the first line, enter **0** in the **From amount** field, enter **100** in the **To amount** field, and enter **5** in the **Charges value** field.
    
      - On the second line, enter **100** in the **From amount** field, leave the **To amount** field blank, and enter **0** in the **Charges value** field.
