2.  Create a new sales order or select an open sales order.

3.  Click **Invoice** \> **Invoice** to open the **Posting invoice** form. For more information, see [Sales posting (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa550287\(v=ax.60\)).

4.  In the **Associated payment attachment on customer invoice** field, select a payment slip to print with the sales invoice. Choose from the following options:
