# Set up Application Integration Framework 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Services and Application Integration Framework (AIF) require that you register new adapters, services, and basic ports any time that you change the Application Object Tree (AOT). Click this checklist item before you configure integration ports for the first time after upgrade. Registration of new adapters, services, and basic ports can take a while. Previously active enhanced ports will need to be reactivated manually.
