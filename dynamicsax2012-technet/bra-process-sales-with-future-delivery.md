# (BRA) Process sales with future delivery 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

In Brazil, a sale of items that uses anticipated invoicing occurs in two phases. In the first phase, you can create a fiscal document for the payment that is received, but there is no movement of inventory. In the second phase, you can generate inventory transactions and Imposto sobre Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços (ICMS) tax transactions when the actual delivery of items occurs.

## Create fiscal document for the payment

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Brazil** \> **Operation type**. Create an operation type that has the following setup:
    
    1.  Select the **Create customer/vendor transactions** check box to specify that the operation type creates customer or vendor transactions.
    
    2.  In the **Item account** field, select the default posting account that is used for the operation type in the ledger.

    –or–
    
    Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Sales orders** \> **All sales orders**.
