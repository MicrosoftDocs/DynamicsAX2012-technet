_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Beginning October 1, 2015, RapidStart services will no longer be supported.

As the Customer administrator for a configuration project in Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services, you can review how much progress has been made on answering questions in the question groups that are included in your configuration project. You can use either the **Projects** page or the **Question groups status** page.

For each question group, you can review the following information:

  - The target date for completing the question group

  - The percentage of questions that have been answered

  - The number of questions in the question group

  - The name of the person who is assigned to the question group

You can use this information to determine which business experts you want to follow up with to make sure that the project is completed on time.
