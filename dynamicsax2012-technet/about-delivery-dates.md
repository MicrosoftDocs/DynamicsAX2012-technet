# About delivery dates 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The delivery date is determined by several factors. The earliest delivery date is based on the sales lead time plus the transport time. Working hours are also considered. The sales lead time is the time that is spent between creating the sales order and shipping the items. After you set up all the relevant parameters, you can select from a list of available ship dates and receipt dates.
