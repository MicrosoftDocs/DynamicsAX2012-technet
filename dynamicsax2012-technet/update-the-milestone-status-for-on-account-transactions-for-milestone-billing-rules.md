# Update the milestone status for on-account transactions for milestone billing rules 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to mark an on-account transaction that is associated with a milestone billing rule as “Complete.” When you create a milestone billing rule, on-account transactions and invoices are created for the sales value of a milestone on a specified date.

1.  Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Common** \> **Projects** \> **Project contracts**.

2.  Select or open a project contract that contains the milestone billing rule that you want to update on-account transactions for.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Maintain** tab, in the **Process** group, click **Manage contract status**.

4.  In the **Contract status** form, select the line of a billing rule to update, and then, on the menu bar, click **Update milestone status**.

5.  In the **Update milestone status** form, select the line of the on-account billing transaction for which you want to change the status to “Completed.”

6.  Select the **Mark as complete** check box.
