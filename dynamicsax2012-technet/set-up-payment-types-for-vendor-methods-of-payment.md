# Set up payment types for vendor methods of payment [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can assign a system-defined payment type, such as **Check**, **Electronic payment**, or **Promissory note**, to any user-defined method of payment. Payment types are useful for validating electronic payments. For more information, see [About payment types](about-payment-types.md).

You can assign a payment type to a payment method at any time. However, payments that you have already made by using that method are not affected.

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Setup** \> **Payment** \> **Methods of payment**.

2.  Select the payment method to assign a payment type to.

3.  In the **Payment type** field, select the payment type to assign to the payment method.
