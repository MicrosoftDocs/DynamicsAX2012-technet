# Assign variant groups 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

## Assign a variant group to a retail hierarchy

When you assign a new product to a retail hierarchy, the variant groups in the retail hierarchy are automatically assigned to the product. Therefore, the sizes, colors, and styles in the variant groups are automatically associated with the product.

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Category hierarchies** \> **Retail product hierarchy**.

2.  Select the category in the hierarchy to add a variant group to.

3.  On the **Retail product properties** FasTab, under **Variant groups**, select a group in the **Size group**, **Color group**, and **Style group** fields.

For more information about retail hierarchies, see [Retail hierarchy](retail-hierarchy.md).

## Assign a variant group to a product

If you are not using retail hierarchies, or if a product belongs to a retail hierarchy that does not include variant groups, you can assign variant groups directly to a product. The sizes, colors, and styles in the variant groups are then automatically associated with the product.

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Common** \> **Products** \> **Released products by category**.

2.  In the **Released product details** form, select the product to add a variant group to. Then, on the **Action Pane**, in the **Maintain** group, click **Edit**.

3.  In the second **Released product details** form, on the **Retail** FastTab, under **Variant**, select an appropriate variant group in the **Size group**, **Color group**, and **Style group** fields.

You can view or modify the sizes, colors, and styles of a product. On the **General** FastTab, view or modify the values in the **Size**, **Color**, and **Style** fields.
