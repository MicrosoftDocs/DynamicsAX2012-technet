# Split the planned order quantity 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

To split the planned order quantity, use the following procedure:

1.  Click **Master planning** \> **Common** \> **Planned orders**.

2.  Select the Planned order line that you want to split.

3.  Click the **Split** button on the **Planned order** tab.

4.  Enter the quantity that you want to move to a second planned order, and select a delivery date by using the drop-down calendar.

5.  Click **OK**.
    
    The program creates two planned orders: one planned order with the quantity and delivery date that you specify; and one planned order with the remaining quantity and the original delivery date.

You can use this function to allow for partial delivery from a vendor.
