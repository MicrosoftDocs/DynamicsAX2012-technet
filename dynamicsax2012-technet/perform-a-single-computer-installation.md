# Perform a single-computer installation 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use the information in this topic to perform a single-computer installation of Microsoft Dynamics AX. Use this type of installation to install a complete Microsoft Dynamics AX system on a single computer for development, demonstration, or testing.

If you install by using the **Single-computer installation** option in Setup, default settings are used to configure all components. User names and passwords are the only input that is required. For more information about the components that are included in the single-computer installation option, see [Installation types](installation-types.md). For more information about individual components, see the corresponding topics in this guide.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> <P>We do not recommend that you perform a single-computer installation in a production environment. Use this type of installation only for development and testing.</P>



## Before you perform a single-computer installation

Prerequisites for all components that are included in the single-server installation must be installed before you can use this type of installation. On the computer where you plan to perform the installation, run the prerequisite validation utility to verify that system requirements have been met. For information about how to run the prerequisite validation utility, see [Check prerequisites](check-prerequisites.md). For more information about the hardware and software requirements for Microsoft Dynamics AX, see the [system requirements](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=165377).

If you add Retail components to a single-computer installation, and the computer is a primary domain controller, the operating system must be Windows Server 2008 R2 or a later release.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Reports and online analytical processing (OLAP) cubes may display errors if the computer is not connected to a domain.</P>
