_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The Mexican government requires that individuals, corporations, and foreign companies operating in Mexico submit an Impuesto sobre la renta (ISR), or federal corporate income tax report. The report displays detailed calculations of provisional income tax payments, and is based on the following factors:

  - ISR concept categories linked to one or more ledger accounts

  - ISR annual rate table

  - ISR utility ratio

## Set up a concept category and assign a ledger account

Use the **ISR report setup** form to set up ISR report concept categories and link them to a ledger account.

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **Sales tax** \> **External** \> **ISR report setup**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a new ISR report concept category.

3.  In the **Concept category** field, select one of the following ISR concept categories to assign to one or more ledger accounts:
    
      - **Revenue** – The income tax is calculated based on the revenue collected during the period.
    
      - **Inventory** – The income tax is calculated based on the status of inventory during the review period.
    
      - **PTU Paid in fiscal year** – The income tax is calculated based on the Participación a los Trabajadores de las Utilidades (PTU) tax paid during the fiscal year.
    
      - **Investment deductions** – The income tax is calculated based on investment deductions for the reporting period.
    
      - **Pending depreciation tax losses** – The income tax is calculated based on pending depreciation tax losses for the reporting period.
    
      - **ISR withheld from bank** – The income tax is calculated based on the ISR withheld from the bank.
    
      - **Tax for cash deposit operations** – The income tax is calculated based on the tax for cash deposit operations.
    
      - **ISR paid for dividends of previous fiscal year** – The income tax is calculated based on the ISR paid on dividends from previous fiscal years.
    
      - **ISR payments** – The income tax is calculated based on ISR payments made for the fiscal year.
    
      - **Balance to compensate for cash** – The income tax is calculated based on the account balance to compensate for cash during the reporting period.
    
      - **Employee allowance paid** – The income tax is calculated based on employee allowances paid during the fiscal year.

4.  In the **Concept category description** field, enter a description of the ISR report concept category.

5.  Click the right pane, and then press CTRL+N to create a new line to link the ISR report concept category to a main account.

6.  In the **Main account** field, select the main account to be linked with the ISR report concept category. The main account name is updated in the **Account name** field.

7.  In the **D/C indicator** field, select the account type indicator:
