# Set up a packed item to bulk item conversion factor 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use this procedure to set up the conversion factor for converting a packed item to a related bulk item. You must create the packed and bulk items before you can set up the conversion factor for them.


> [!TIP]
> <P>The <STRONG>Factor</STRONG> that you enter in this procedure is a different factor than the one that you might enter in the standard <STRONG>Unit conversions</STRONG> form. You use the <STRONG>Bulk Item Conversion</STRONG> form to identify how much of the bulk item is contained within each of the packed items. For example, if you identify the bulk item in a unit of measure of GL and the packed item in a unit of measure of CS that contains six gallons of the bulk item, the <STRONG>Factor</STRONG> would be 6.</P>



1.  Click **Product information management** \> **Common** \> **Released products**.

2.  Select the packed product that you want to convert.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Manage inventory** tab, in the **Packaging** group, click **Bulk item conversion**.

4.  In the **Bulk item conversion** form, in the **Bulk item** field, select the identifier for the bulk product to use in the conversion.

5.  In the **Factor** field, enter any quantity to be added to the unit upon conversion.

6.  In the **Rounding** field, select the applicable rounding factor.


> [!TIP]
> <P>If you want to confirm that the conversion factors that you entered generate the results that you expect, use the <STRONG>Calculator for units</STRONG> button.</P>
