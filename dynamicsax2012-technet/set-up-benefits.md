You can set up current and future benefits that workers and their dependents and beneficiaries can receive. Examples of benefits include medical, investments, and parking benefits.

Benefits are defined by benefit types, plans, and options:

  - Type – A collection of plans for a specific benefit, such as medical or parking.

  - Plan – A specific benefit contracted from a provider.

  - Option – The coverage level, such as employee only or employee and spouse.

## Set up a new benefit

Use the **Benefits** form to set up new benefits to assign to your workers.

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Setup** \> **Benefits** \> **Benefit elements**.

2.  In the **Types** area, click **New** to create a benefit type.

3.  Type the name of the benefit type and a description.

4.  Select one of the following options:
    
      - **Multiple enrollments per type** – You can enroll a worker in multiple plans with the same benefit type, even if the enrollment is effective for the same period. For example, two term life insurance plans.
    
      - **One enrollment per type** – You cannot enroll a worker in more than one plan with the same benefit type for the same period. For example, if the worker already has health insurance for a specified time period, you cannot assign another health insurance that covers the same period.

5.  In the **Plans** area, click **New** to create a benefit plan.

6.  Enter the name of the benefit plan, a description, and select the benefit type.

9.  To allow dependents to be covered under the benefit, select the **Allow dependent coverage** check box.

10. To allow beneficiaries to be designated to the benefit, select the **Allow beneficiary designations** check box.

11. To add an option to the benefit plan, in the **Plans** area, click **Add**.

12. In the **Option** field, select a benefit option to add to the benefit plan.

13. In the **Effective** field, enter the first date when the option is available to the worker.

14. In the **Expiration** field, enter the last date when the option is available to the worker.
