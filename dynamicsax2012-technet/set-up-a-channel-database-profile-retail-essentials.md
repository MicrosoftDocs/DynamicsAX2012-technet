# Set up a channel database profile (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

A channel database profile provides the information that enables Retail essentials to communicate with a retail channel database. This topic explains how to set up a channel database profile.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Retail essentials, the form that you use to complete this task includes a subset of the controls that are available for other configurations of Retail. If a topic about this form describes controls that you don't see, it may be because you’re using Retail essentials.</P>



1.  Click **Retail essentials** \> **Data synchronization** \> **Setup** \> **Store integration** \> **Channel database**.

2.  Click **New** to create a new channel database profile.

3.  Enter the following information:
    
      - **Channel database ID** – Type a name for the profile.
    
      - **Channel data group** – Select a channel data group for the database. When you run a distribution schedule, a data package is generated for each data group. All channel databases in a data group subscribe to the same data.
        
        A data group can contain one or more databases, but a database can belong to only one data group.
    
      - **User name** and **Password** – Enter the user name and password that Commerce Data Exchange: Async Client uses to communicate with Commerce Data Exchange: Async Server.
    
      - **Async Server profile** – Select the Async Server profile to use together with the database.

4.  On the **Retail channel** FastTab, click **Add** to select the channels that use this database.

5.  On the **Retail Server** FastTab, enter the name of the server that hosts the channel database, and enter the name of the channel database.

6.  To synchronize all data for the channel database, click **Full data sync**, and then select the distribution schedule that is named **Full sync**.
