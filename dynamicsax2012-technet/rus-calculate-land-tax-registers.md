# (RUS) Calculate land tax registers 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

The total land tax to be paid to the budget at the end of the tax period is determined as the difference between the tax total and the totals of advance tax payments that were estimated over the course of the tax period individually for every tax base. The tax and advance payments totals are calculated in the tax register journal.

To create a land tax declaration, these registers must be calculated and approved in the journal:

  - **Land tax - ground areas** – This register calculates the land tax amount for every fixed asset, based on the cadastral value with the tax benefits, coefficients, and land rates taken into account.

  - **Land tax** – This register summarizes the data and calculates the land tax amount based on RCOAD codes (National Classifier of Administrative and Territorial Subdivisions), budget classification codes (BCC), and land tax codes.
