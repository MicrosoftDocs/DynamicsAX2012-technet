You can store copies of the XML code for documents that are exchanged with Application Integration Framework (AIF). You can then view the copies in the **Document log** form. The **Document log** form displays a record of the numbered versions of the document, the related processing steps, and the date and time for each log entry. You selected a logging mode when you configured the troubleshooting options for a port. For more information about logging modes, see [Configure troubleshooting options for integration ports](configure-troubleshooting-options-for-integration-ports.md).

To use the document log, follow these steps.

1.  Click **System administration** \> **Periodic** \> **Services and Application Integration Framework** \> **History**.

2.  In the **Display by** field, select **Document**.

3.  On the **Overview** tab, select a document, and then click **Document logs**.

4.  To view the XML code that is associated with one of the versions, select the record, and then click **View XML**.
