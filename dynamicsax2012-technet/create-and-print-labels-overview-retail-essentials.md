# Create and print labels overview (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

In Retail essentials, you can generate and print labels to use in stores. A label is a piece of paper, polymer, cloth, metal, or other material that is attached to a product, a container, or a shelf. A label can also be printed directly on a container or an item. Retail essentials offers two types of labels: product labels and shelf labels. Product labels are always specific to a particular variant, but shelf labels don’t have to be.

You can use labels for a variety of purposes, such as the following:

  - Product identification

  - Name tags

  - Bar codes

  - Pricing

  - Warnings

  - Batch numbers

  - Expiration dates

You can generate product and shelf labels for individual products or for multiple products at one time. After the labels are generated you can print them. Generate product and shelf labels for products in the following scenarios:

  - From purchase orders regardless of the purchase order status

  - From transfer orders when the products are shipped or when transfer orders are received

  - From the **Released product details** form

When you generate labels in the scenarios listed above, you can specify the number of labels that you want to print. You can also add products to the list and generate labels for those products at the same time.

The following table lists the forms that support the labels business process component. The table entries are organized by business process component task and then alphabetically by form name.
