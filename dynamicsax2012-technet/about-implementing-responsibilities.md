# About implementing responsibilities 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

By using responsibility assignments in Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can have a worker title automatically assigned to new procedures and tasks. Identifying and assigning process responsibilities on an organizational level can make it easier and more efficient to assign the appropriate staff to specific tasks, such as developing and conducting marketing campaigns.

When responsibility assignments are made in the system, you do not have to remember or track which workers or worker titles are assigned to specific activities in your organization’s business process. If the worker title that appears for a particular task is incorrect, you can change it.

For example, if the sales manager is responsible for tracking opportunities in your organization's sales processes, selecting the **Opportunity** check box on the sales manager line automatically assigns the sales manager to all opportunities.
