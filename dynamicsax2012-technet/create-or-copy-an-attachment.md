_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can apply these procedures to any other party record form in the **Sales and marketing** section.

## Create a document

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Common** \> **Prospects** \> **All prospects**.

2.  Select the prospect record that you want to create an attachment for or attach a document to.

3.  Click **Attachments** to open the form.

4.  Press CTRL+N to create a new document.

5.  Select the document type in the **Documents** form and then click **OK**.
    
    The document icon in the **Prospects** form changes from an empty sheet of paper to a book. This indicates that there are documents attached to the prospect record.

2.  In the **Prospects** form, select the prospect record from which you want to copy a document.

3.  Click **Attachments** to open the **Documents** form.
    
    Verify that the document attached is a type that can be opened, such as a Microsoft Word file type or a Microsoft Excel worksheet.

4.  Click **Copy**.

5.  In the **Description** field, update the description of the newly copied document.

## Copy a document to the Clipboard

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Common** \> **Prospects** \> **All prospects**.

    The active document is now copied to the Clipboard and can be pasted into any file that accepts text (such as email or a document).

5.  Press CTRL+V to paste the copied document into the destination.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The copy-and-paste procedure creates a copy of the selected document in the file system but does not maintain any connection to the document management system of Microsoft Dynamics AX. No new document identification is created, nor is the copied document attached to any record.</P>
