# (RUS) Amortize an unrecoverable debt in Accounts receivable 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Before you can amortize unrecoverable debt, you must create the register journal for the period during which the amortization is run, and calculate and approve the Accounts receivable â€“ reserves.

After the amortization records are updated, the total amount of the transactions equals the minimum of the marked lines total of unrecoverable debt and reserve amount of doubtful debt.

If the unrecoverable debt total exceeds the amount of the reserve, transactions are created to amortize debt in the unrealized expense and revenue accounts to cover the remaining amount. The created transactions are automatically settled with the unrecoverable accounts and issued advance payments, and therefore, unrecoverable accounts receivable is settled. The voucher amortization date is the same as the date that is specified in the **Calculation date** field.
