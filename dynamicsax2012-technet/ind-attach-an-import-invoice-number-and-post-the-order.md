[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic has not been fully updated for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2.</P>



Use the **Invoice registration** form to attach an importer invoice number provided by the importer and post the invoice registration details for the import purchase order. You can update the received quantity for the import purchase order and view the list of importer invoice numbers.

When you update the **Invoice registration** form, the **Document status** field on the **General** tab of the **Purchase order** form is updated with the invoice registration.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can create the same combination of importer invoice number and purchase order only once. A combination of importer invoice number and purchase order can be deleted and entered again before posting a bill of entry. The <STRONG>Bill of entry</STRONG> option is available only if you post the <STRONG>Invoice registration</STRONG> form.</P>
