# Import ISV upgraded layer model(s) into new model store [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

If an ISV has provided you with model files upgraded to Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 or a later version, you should import those models into the ISV layer of the new model store at this point in the code upgrade process. This operation is performed using AxUtil. For information about importing models, see [Import layer model(s) into new model store](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh209710\(v=ax.60\)). When you are done, mark the **Import ISV upgraded layer model(s) into new model store** task as complete.
