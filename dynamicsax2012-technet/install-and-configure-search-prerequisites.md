## Verify SharePoint components before you install Enterprise Search

Use the following procedure to verify that SharePoint Search is configured correctly. We recommend that you perform these checks before you attempt to install Microsoft Dynamics AX Enterprise Search.

1.  Click **Start** \> **All Programs** \> **Microsoft SharePoint Products**, and then click **SharePoint Central Administration**.

2.  Click **System Settings**, and then click **Manage Services on Server**.

3.  Verify that the **SharePoint Server Search** service is running. Also verify that the **SharePoint Foundation Search** service is stopped. SharePoint Foundation Search is not required for Enterprise Search.
    

    > [!WARNING]
    > <P>If SharePoint Server Search does not appear in the list, you might be using SharePoint Foundation, which requires additional configuration. See the section titled “SharePoint Search or SharePoint Server Search 14 service does not pass the prerequisite check” in <A href="troubleshoot-installation-issues-with-enterprise-search.md">Troubleshoot installation issues with Enterprise Search</A>.</P>



4.  From SharePoint Central Administration, click **Manage Service Applications**.

5.  Click the **Business Data Connectivity Service** link and verify that the page loads without errors.

6.  On the **Manage Service Applications** page, click the **Search Service Application** link and verify that the page loads without errors.

7.  On the **Search Administration** page, click the **Content Sources** link and verify that the page loads without errors.

If all pages loaded without errors, you can install Microsoft Dynamics AX Enterprise Search in the environment. For more information, see [Install Microsoft Dynamics AX Enterprise Search](install-microsoft-dynamics-ax-enterprise-search.md).

## Verify the Business Connector Proxy Account for Search Services

The SharePoint Server Search service and the Search Host Controller service must run as the Microsoft Dynamics AX Business Connector Proxy (BC proxy) account to access Microsoft Dynamics AX data. If these services are not configured to run as the BC proxy, Search returns no results.

Use the following procedure to specify the BC proxy for the SharePoint Server Search service and the Search Host Controller service.

1.  Locate the alias and domain for BC proxy in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client. Click **System administration** \> **Setup** \> **System** \> **System service accounts**.

2.  In SharePoint Central Administration, click **Security**, and then click **Configure Service Accounts**.

3.  In the **Credential Management** list, click **Windows Service - Search Host Controller Service**.

4.  In the **Select an account for this component** list, verify that the BC proxy is selected. If you do not see the BC proxy as an option, click the **Register new managed account** link and create an account that uses the alias and domain of the BC proxy. Click **OK** to save your changes.

5.  Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the **Windows Service - SharePoint Server Search** service.

6.  In SharePoint Central Administration, click **System Settings**, and then click **Manage services on server**.

7.  Locate **Search Host Controller Service** in the list. Stop and restart this service.

8.  In Windows, type services.msc in the **Run** dialog box and press Enter.

9.  Locate **SharePoint Server Search** in the list of services. Stop and restart this service.
