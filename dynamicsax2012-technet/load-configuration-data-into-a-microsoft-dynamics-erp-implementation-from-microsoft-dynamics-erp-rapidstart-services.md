# Load configuration data into a Microsoft Dynamics ERP implementation from Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Beginning October 1, 2015, RapidStart services will no longer be supported. For more information, see the announcement on CustomerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/northamerica/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued or PartnerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/news-events/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued.

Your company may want to extend Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 to support functionality for add-ins that partners or independent software vendors (ISVs) create for you. In this case, you can add tables and fields to Microsoft Dynamics AX to support this functionality before you populate those tables and fields with data.

Before the employee who is working in the Designer role for your Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services project can create questions to support this functionality, RapidStart Services must be updated to include these tables and fields. The Designer can then reference the tables and fields as the targets for the configuration data that is loaded into Microsoft Dynamics AX.

Before your organization can load data into an implementation of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, you must establish a connection between RapidStart Services and Microsoft Dynamics AX.

The topics in this section provide information to help you effectively install and use components for transferring data between RapidStart Services and Microsoft Dynamics AX.
