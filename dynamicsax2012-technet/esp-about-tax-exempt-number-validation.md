Tax-exempt numbers are unique identifiers issued by the Agencia Estatal de Administración Tributaria (AEAT) to Spanish companies and individuals, and to foreign residents. These numbers must be included on all legal documents. To comply with validation requirements, some companies must change their tax-exempt numbers, and will post transactions using both their old and new tax-exempt numbers.

The three tax-exempt numbers are the Código de Identificación Fiscal (CIF), Número de Identificación Fiscal (NIF), and Número de Identificación de Extranjeros (NIE).

## CIF tax-exempt number validation

The CIF is issued to Spanish companies. It consists of nine alphanumeric characters in the format TDDDDDDDC, where:

  - T – A letter that identifies the type of company.

  - D – A number from zero to nine.

  - C – A control element, which can be a number or a letter.

## NIF tax-exempt number validation

The NIF is issued to individuals. It consists of nine alphanumeric characters in the format DDDDDDDDC, where:

  - D – A number from zero to nine.
