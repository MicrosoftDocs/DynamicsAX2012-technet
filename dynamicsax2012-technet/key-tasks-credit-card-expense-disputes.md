# Key tasks: Credit card expense disputes 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

There may be times when you incur a credit card expense, and the transaction that appears on the credit card statement is incorrect. If this scenario occurs, first contact the merchant where the expense was incurred. However, if you cannot resolve the issue by contacting the merchant, you can create a credit card expense dispute. This dispute is then sent to the credit card institution.

You can assign another worker as a delegate to submit a credit card expense dispute on your behalf. For more information, see [Add delegates](add-delegates.md).

## Create a credit card expense dispute

You can create a dispute record for a credit card transaction on an expense report. Create disputes only when the issue is with the credit card company, not with the merchant where the purchase was made.

The Credit Card Transactions Dispute Wizard guides you through the steps to create a dispute record for a credit card transaction on an expense report.
