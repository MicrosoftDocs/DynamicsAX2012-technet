# Complete a workflow decision 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A decision represents a point at which a workflow divides into two branches. To make a decision, you must select one of two choices. The choices are typically **Yes** and **No**, or **True** and **False**. The choice that you make determines the workflow branch that is used to process the submitted document.

Follow these steps to make a decision.

1.  Open the document that the decision is associated with.

2.  Review the message bar for information about the workflow process. To view detailed instructions, click the icon in the message bar. The following figure shows the location of the message bar and the icon that you can click to view instructions.

3.  A decision can be assigned to multiple people; however, only one person can make the decision. If this decision is assigned to multiple people, but you want to make it, click **Actions** \> **Accept**. This indicates that you will make the decision.

4.  Click **Actions** and then click one of the options listed in the following table.
