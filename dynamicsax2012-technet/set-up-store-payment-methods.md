# Set up store payment methods 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

After you create a payment method in Retail, you can assign the payment method to stores. Multiple payment methods for stores can be based on a single organization-wide payment method. Each store payment method can have different settings.

For each payment method, you can specify the following information:

  - The general ledger account or bank account in which each payment method is posted

  - The minimum change amount that can be given for various payment methods

  - The conditions under which change can be given

You can also assign reason codes to each payment method. These reason codes prompt a cashier to take any of the following actions:

  - Create entries that have unique entry codes

  - Verify that entries have unique entry codes

  - Collect information from the customer

**Example**

  - The payment method is named **Voucher**.

  - The **Above minimum change tender** field is set to **voucher**.

  - The **Change tender** field is set to **Cash**.

  - The **Minimum change** field is set to **20.00**.

**Case 1**: A customer buys products that are worth 475.00, and pays by using a voucher that is worth 500.00. The customer is owed 25.00 in change. The cashier issues a new voucher for 25.00 to the customer because the amount that is owed to the customer is above the value in the **Minimum change** field.

**Case 2**: A customer buys products that are worth 485.00, and pays by using a voucher that is worth 500.00. The customer is owed 15.00 in change. The cashier gives the customer 15.00 in cash because the amount that is owed to the customer is under the value in the **Minimum change** field.

If Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 is installed, you can also specify the currencies that are accepted in the store. For example, the currency codes that you enter are used to determine the currencies that are available during the Pay currency operation in Microsoft Dynamics AX for Retail POS.

Retail POS uses only currencies for which an exchange rate conversion is configured for the company that the store is assigned to.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you copy a payment method from one store into another store, any currencies that are set up for the original store are copied to the new store.</P>
