# Manage user groups [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

To use some features and functionality in Microsoft Dynamics AX, you may have to create user groups. For example, if users who are outside the organization hierarchy for budget planning must work with budget plans, you can assign budget plans to user groups. You can also set up restrictions for journal posting that are based on user groups.

The following procedure describes how to create a user group and add users to it.

1.  Click **System administration** \> **Common** \> **Users** \> **User groups**.

2.  On the **Groups** tab, press CTRL+N to create a new group.

3.  In the **Group** column, enter a short name for the group. A short name is required. For example, enter **Budget A** for a budgeting group or **Journals 1** for a journal posting group.

4.  In the **User group name** column, enter a long name for the group. A long name is required. For example, enter **Budgeting group A** or **Journal posting group 1**.
    
    To avoid confusion, we recommend that you make the names of user groups as descriptive as you can.

5.  Click the **Users** tab.

6.  In the **Remaining users** list, select users. Then click the left arrow button (**\<**) to move the selected users to the **Selected users** list. All users that you move to the **Selected users** list are added to the group.
