# View credit memos (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

Credit memos are vouchers that can be issued to and redeemed by a customer at a store. Use the following procedure to view the credit memos that have been issued.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Retail essentials, the form that you use to complete this task includes a subset of the controls that are available for other configurations of Retail. If a topic about this form describes controls that you don't see, it may be because you’re using Retail essentials.</P>



1.  Click **Retail essentials** \> **Financials** \> **Credit memos**.
    
    The **Credit memo table** form displays a list of all the retail credit memos that have been issued. Each line includes the number of the credit memo, the date and time of the transaction, and the amount or value of the credit memo. If the credit memo has been redeemed, the **Applied** check box is selected, and the applied amount, applied date, and applied time are updated accordingly.

2.  To filter the transactions for credit memos based on the transaction and ranges for the applied date, use the query groups that are provided in the form.

3.  A report that contains the data is displayed on the screen. To print this report, click **Print** in the **Credit memo table** form.
