# Set other tax options for stores 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

When you set up sales taxes for retail stores, you can specify several settings. For example, you can assign sales tax groups to stores, specify inclusive taxes or exclusive taxes, and set up overrides.

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Common** \> **Retail channels** \> **Retail stores**.

2.  Open the store to set up tax options for. Alternatively, on the **Store** tab, on the **Action Pane**, click **Retail store** to create a new store.

3.  In the **Stores** form, on the **General** FastTab, under **Sales tax**, specify values for any of the following fields that apply to the store:
    
      - **Tax identification number (TIN)** – Type the store's TIN.
        

        > [!NOTE]
        > <P>To print the TIN on receipts, enable the <STRONG>Tax Identification Number</STRONG> element in the <STRONG>Header</STRONG> of the receipt in the <STRONG>Receipt format designer</STRONG> form.</P>

    
      - **Sales tax group** – For more information, see [Assign sales tax groups to stores](assign-sales-tax-groups-to-stores.md).
    
      - **Prices include sales tax** – For more information, see [Specify inclusive or exclusive tax](specify-inclusive-or-exclusive-tax.md).
    
      - (IND) **STC number** – Type the service tax code for the store. If this field is left blank, the service tax code for the company is used in tax calculations.
        

        > [!NOTE]
        > <P>This field is intended for use in India. To print the service tax code on receipts, modify the form's layout by adding a <STRONG>Text</STRONG> field that contains the service tax code.</P>

    
      - **Use destination-based tax** – Select this check box to use the customer's shipping address in tax calculations, instead of the store's sales tax group.
