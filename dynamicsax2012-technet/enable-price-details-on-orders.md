# Enable price details on orders 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to enable and view price details in sales orders and purchase orders. After price details are enabled, workers can look up pricing information for order lines. Information that workers can view includes unit prices, discount amounts, margin estimations, trade agreements, and rebate amounts.

## Enable price details

Use these procedures to enable the **Price details** form for sales orders and purchase orders.

To enable price details for purchase orders, follow these steps.

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Setup** \> **Procurement and sourcing parameters**.

2.  In the left pane, click **Prices**.

3.  Under **Price details**, select the **Enable price details** check box.

To enable price details for sales orders, follow these steps.

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Accounts receivable parameters**.

2.  In the left pane, click **Prices**.

3.  Under **Price details**, select the **Enable price details** check box.

> <P>Many of the other pricing options that are displayed in the <STRONG>Price details</STRONG> form require setup. For example, if you want to view vendor rebates, you must first set up vendor rebate agreements as described in <A href="set-up-vendor-rebate-agreements.md">Set up vendor rebate agreements</A>.</P>
