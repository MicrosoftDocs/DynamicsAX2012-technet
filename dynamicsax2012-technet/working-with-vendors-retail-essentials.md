# Working with vendors (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Retail essentials, the form that you use to complete this task includes a subset of the controls that are available for other configurations of Retail. If a topic about this form describes controls that you don't see, it may be because youâ€™re using Retail essentials.</P>
