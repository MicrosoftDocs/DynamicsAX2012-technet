# Working with vendors (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

When you create a vendor account, you enter information about the vendor in a vendor record. This information is used to populate documents automatically and to track activity that is related to the vendor. This topic explains how to create, update, and delete vendor records.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Retail essentials, the form that you use to complete this task includes a subset of the controls that are available for other configurations of Retail. If a topic about this form describes controls that you don't see, it may be because you’re using Retail essentials.</P>
