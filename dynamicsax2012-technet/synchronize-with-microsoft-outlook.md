> [!IMPORTANT]
> <P>Note the following considerations about synchronization:</P>
> <UL>
> <LI>
> <P>Group activities are synchronized for Outlook appointments, but tasks are not synchronized.</P>
> <LI>
> <P>Group activities are synchronized between Microsoft Dynamics AX and Outlook only if the organizer of the activity has synchronized the activity. For group activities, the organizer must first synchronize the activity. Then either Microsoft Dynamics AX or Outlook creates or updates the activities for the attendees. If the organizer does not first synchronize the activity, the attendee activities are not synchronized.</P>
> <LI>
> <P>Recurring activities are synchronized.</P>
> <LI>
> <P>The Outlook synchronization features in the <STRONG>Sales and marketing</STRONG> module are not supported when the Microsoft Dynamics AX client is deployed by using Remote Desktop Services.</P></LI></UL>
