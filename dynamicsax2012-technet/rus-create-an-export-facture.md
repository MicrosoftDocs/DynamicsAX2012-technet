# (RUS) Create an export facture

A facture is considered to be an export facture if it contains invoices that have a tax type of **VAT 0%**, and if the tax code for the domestic market is set. You can specify the export, package, and confirmation dates, and view the expiration date for the export facture. Use the following procedures to create an export facture and specify how the export facture is processed based on the operation type.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You must define the <STRONG>Tax code for domestic market</STRONG> value for sales tax codes with a tax type of <STRONG>VAT 0%</STRONG>.</P>

2.  On the **Foreign trade** tab, in the **Export date** field, select the date when the items were exported under customs export conditions. The **Export date** field displays the date from which the expiration date is calculated to collect the document package that confirms the right to use the value-added tax (VAT) at a rate of zero percent.

3.  In the **Package date** field, select the date of the document package collection.

4.  In the **Confirmation date** field, select the date when the VAT was confirmed by the tax authority at a rate of zero percent.
    
    The **Expiration date** field displays the date when the period that is set to collect the document package to confirm the right to use VAT at a rate of zero percent expires. If the tax authority does not confirm your right before the **Expiration date**, the taxpayer is obligated to calculate VAT by using the rate for **Tax code for domestic market**. This date is calculated according to the **Export date** value and the number of days in the export confirmation period.
