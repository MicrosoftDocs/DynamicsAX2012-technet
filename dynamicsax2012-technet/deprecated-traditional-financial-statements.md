# Deprecated: Traditional financial statements 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can use traditional financial statements to report on an organization's financial state at the end of a defined period. The traditional financial statements can include an operating statement (an income statement that includes the results shown with regard to profit and loss for typical business activities), a balance sheet (assets and liabilities), and other financial information.

After you design a traditional financial statement, you generate traditional financial statements for each financial period and for the whole year. You can also export traditional financial statements to Microsoft Excel.

<td><p>Reason for deprecation</p></td>
<td><p>The traditional financial statement functionality that is included in Microsoft Dynamics AX will be deprecated in a future release. The reports and forms do not provide some of the financial reporting capabilities and report design flexibility that financial and business professionals must have in order to improve their organization’s performance.</p></td>

<td><p>Replaced by another feature</p></td>
<td><p>Management Reporter for Microsoft Dynamics ERP is an interactive reporting application that financial and business professionals can use to create, maintain, deploy, and view financial statements. Management Reporter lets you design financial reports based on ledger accounts and financial dimensions, drill down to transaction-level detail, perform currency translation, and use web-based report viewing.</p>
<p>In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 cumulative update 6 and later, the <strong>Financial statement (traditional)</strong> configuration key controls access to the traditional financial statement forms and functionality. This configuration key is not selected automatically in new installations of Microsoft Dynamics AX so that new users can use Management Reporter, instead.</p>
