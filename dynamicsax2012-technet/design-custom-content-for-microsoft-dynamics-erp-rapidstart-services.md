# Design custom content for Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Beginning October 1, 2015, RapidStart services will no longer be supported. For more information, see the announcement on CustomerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/northamerica/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued or PartnerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/news-events/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued.

When you use Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services to configure an implementation of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, you can use the **Design** area in RapidStart Services to create additional content to support add-ins and solutions that partners or independent software vendors (ISVs) create for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. This additional content can consist of questions, question groups, functional areas, and templates that the Customer administrator for your organization can add to a configuration project in Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services. Business experts in an organization can then answer questions to produce configuration data for the custom solutions that have been added to a Microsoft Dynamics AX implementation.

The topics in this section provide information about how to extend the scope of RapidStart Services by using the **Design** area in RapidStart Services.
