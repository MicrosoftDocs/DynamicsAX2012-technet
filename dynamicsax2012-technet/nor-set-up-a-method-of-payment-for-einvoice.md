eInvoice or eFaktura is an online business-to-consumer banking solution that lets you send electronic invoices to an online bank account for a customer, and receive payments together with other optical character recognition (OCR) payments. eInvoice is cost-efficient, because companies do not have to print and send invoices to customers by using postal mail.

Only customers who have been approved by the company for the eInvoice service can use the eInvoice service.
