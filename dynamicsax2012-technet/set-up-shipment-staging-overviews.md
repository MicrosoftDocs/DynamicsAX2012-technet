_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This topic applies to features in the **Inventory management** module. It does not apply to features in the [Warehouse management](warehouse-management.md) module.

Use shipment staging to gain an overview of the processes at the outbound dock before shipping. Staging shipments helps make it more efficient to repackage or consolidate items after picking.

1.  Click **Inventory management** \> **Periodic** \> **Shipments** \> **Shipment staging**.

2.  On the **Setup** tab, under **Handling status**, select the fields to define the view of your shipments at the outbound dock, for example, the **Staged** or **Loaded** fields.

3.  Specify whether you want the form to automatically update at startup and whether you want the range fields to automatically update, as well.

4.  Save the setup with a name.

5.  On the **Overview** tab, enter the relevant information about the shipment lines that you want to query.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can also save the range that you have specified and this is added to the setup that you have saved.</P>



6.  Click **Update** to see all shipments that correspond to the query that you have specified.
