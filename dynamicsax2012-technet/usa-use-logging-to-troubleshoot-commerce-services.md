# (USA) Use logging to troubleshoot Commerce Services 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can turn on operation logging when you want to troubleshoot problems with Commerce Services for Microsoft Dynamics ERP. Logging creates a log file that lists all requests from Microsoft Dynamics AX to Commerce Services. Enable logging for troubleshooting only, because logging adversely affects performance. Always turn logging off after troubleshooting.
