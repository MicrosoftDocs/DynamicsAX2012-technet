# About work planner 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The work planner is a graphic tool that enables you to plan shift work and print the plan.

## About work planner and time profiles

In the work planner, you select a predefined work time profile and then allocate the profile to one or more workers. Examples are day shift and night shift profiles. Profiles contain various elements included in a work day, such as standard work time, break time, and overtime. Work planner entries are saved in the profile calendar.

The profile calendar contains profile entries that differ from the standard work time profiles that are applied to a worker or a group of workers. Here are several examples of profile changes:

  - A group of workers switch to the evening shift for a predefined period.

  - A worker works on a Sunday or a national holiday. Therefore, a special profile or a Sunday profile may be used.

For more information about work time profiles, see [About profiles for time and attendance registrations](about-profiles-for-time-and-attendance-registrations.md).

It is possible to create entries directly in the profile calendar, or in the work planner. In the profile calendar, you can make one entry at a time in a list or for one day at a time. You can also create profile changes for one worker or a profile group for a time period in the **Compose profile calendar** form. The work planner offers a graphic overview of profile selections for one or more workers.
