The **Statement journal** form displays a list of all statements and statement lines that have been posted. There is one statement line per payment method per register. You can view a list of the transactions that are associated with any statement or statement line. These transactions include tender declaration transactions, payment transactions, and banked tender transactions. You can also view the vouchers that are included in the sales orders for each statement. These vouchers include sales vouchers, payment vouchers, discount vouchers, and the special vouchers that are created by **Retail**.

To sort the results of the inquiry, click the column headers. To filter the data based on any field in the header or any line in the form, click the filter buttons on the toolbar. For example, filter the upper pane by a specific store, and then filter the lower pane by a specific register.

To access the **Statement journal** form, do the following:

  - Click **Retail** \> **Inquiries** \> **Posted statements**.
