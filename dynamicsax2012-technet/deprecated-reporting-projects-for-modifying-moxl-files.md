_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

<td><p>Reason for deprecation</p></td>
<td><p>In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, the development experience is being aligned with repository-centric development for Microsoft Dynamics AX. Therefore, all model data is stored in the repository and is directly modified on the repository.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Replaced by another feature</p></td>
<td><p>Yes. A new project that is known as a Model Project enables direct modification of any reporting data on the repository. Local .moxl files are not required.</p>
