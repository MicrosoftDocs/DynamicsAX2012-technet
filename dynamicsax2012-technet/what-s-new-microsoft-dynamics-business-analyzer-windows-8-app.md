# What's new: Microsoft Dynamics Business Analyzer Windows 8 App 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

Microsoft Dynamics Business Analyzer for Windows 8 provides a dashboard where you can view and interact with Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports without logging on to your Microsoft Dynamics ERP solution. You can select from a set of default reports that are based on your selected role. Alternatively, you can personalize the application so that it includes the reports that are most important to you.

## Features

  - Connect to Reporting Services to display reports for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics GP 2013, and Microsoft Dynamics SL 2011 FP1.

  - Interact with reports by using various report actions, such as copy, edit, view, and refresh.

  - Open the Windows 8 edition of Microsoft Lync from a report to start a conversation with someone about the report.
