You can temporarily assign workers to other calculation or approval groups than they are normally associated with. This can be done on a specific date, or for a period of time.

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Common** \> **Workers** \> **Time registration workers**. Select the worker, click the **Time registration** tab, and on the Action Pane click **Set up time registration worker** and select **Temporary group assignment**

2.  Press Ctrl+N, or click **New** on the toolbar, to create a new record.

3.  In the **Profile date** field, select the date on which the worker is seconded to another group.

4.  If the worker is seconded to another calculation group, select the group in the **Calculation group** field.

5.  If the worker is seconded to another approval group, select the group in the **Approval group** field.

6.  If you want to second the worker to another group for a longer period of time:
    
    1.  Click **Compose**.
    
    2.  Select the start and end dates in the **From date** and **To date** fields.
    
    3.  If the worker is seconded to another calculation group, select the group in the **Calculation group** field.
    
    4.  If the worker is seconded to another approval group, select the group in the **Approval group** field.
    
    5.  Select the **Overwrite** check box.
