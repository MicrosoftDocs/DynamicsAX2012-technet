# (IND) Post a shipping bill for an export sales order 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Before you can export goods, you must generate a shipping bill for the goods. Before you can generate a shipping bill, you must create an export sales order and generate and post the invoice for it. You must generate a shipping bill before you can run the incentive scheme processes, such as the duty drawback process, to calculate and apply for incentives for a selected time period.

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Customs export order**.

2.  On the **Customs export order** list page, on the **Action pane**, in the **New** group, click **Export order**.

3.  In the **Export order** form, click **New** to create a new line.

4.  In the **Sales order** field, select a sales order number in the list. Only export sales orders that have been invoiced appear in the list.

5.  In the **Invoice** field, select the invoice number of a posted sales order. All other fields in this form are updated automatically.

6.  Click **Shipping bill** to set up the parameters to generate a shipping bill for the export order.

7.  In the **Posting shipping bill** form, on the **Parameters** tab, in the **Parameter** group, select the **Shipping bill** check box.

8.  In the **Number** field, select the posted shipping bill that the export transactions apply to.

9.  In the lower pane, click the **Line incentive scheme** tab to view the customs tariff code, duty drawback details, port ID, and product group information that was specified on the selected sales invoice.
