# Create and invoice an intercompany sales order for internal use 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Typically, an intercompany sales order is created automatically, based on an intercompany purchase order. You can also manually create an intercompany sales order, which then generates an intercompany purchase order in the intercompany customer's legal entity.
