# About setting up Retail POS 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

Microsoft Dynamics AX for Retail POS is the point of sale (POS) program for Retail. You can use Retail POS to perform the following tasks:

  - Process sales.

  - Operate the cash drawer.

  - Scan bar codes.

  - Print customer receipts.

  - Calculate the sales total.

  - Calculate tax.

  - Calculate the change that is due back from the amount that was paid.

POS tasks are performed by using a POS register. Each POS register is uniquely identified by a register number. You can use a POS register to complete the following store transactions:

  - Process product sales.

  - Issue product refunds.

  - Suspend transactions.

  - Process customer loyalty transactions.

  - Issue credit memos.

  - Issue gift cards.

  - Scan bar codes.

  - Receive payments.

  - Print receipts.

  - Track customer orders.

  - Process debit cards and credit cards.

  - Connect to other systems on the network.

  - Check inventory.

This section includes instructions for the following tasks:

  - [Set up registers](set-up-registers.md)

  - [Setting up screen layouts](setting-up-screen-layouts.md)

  - [Set up receipt formats](set-up-receipt-formats.md)

  - [Set up receipt profiles](set-up-receipt-profiles.md)

  - [Set up keyboard mapping groups](set-up-keyboard-mapping-groups.md)

  - [Set up hardware profiles](set-up-hardware-profiles.md)

  - [Set up visual profiles](set-up-visual-profiles.md)

  - [Set up a Real-time Service profile](set-up-a-real-time-service-profile.md)

Some changes that are made to the configuration of Retail POS do not take effect at a store until the registers in the store are restarted. In general, any change that affects the setup or configuration of a POS register requires a register restart. These changes include modifications to the POS register's hardware profile.

The following tasks are also related to register setup:

  - Set up functionality profiles – Functionality profiles contain the functional setup of all registers in the store. For more information about how to set up a functionality profile, see [Set up and assign functionality profiles](set-up-and-assign-functionality-profiles.md).

  - Set up reason codes – Reason codes display messages to cashiers and can be used to collect reasons for actions that the cashiers perform. For more information about how to set up reason codes, see [Set up info codes](set-up-info-codes.md).

  - Set up Retail POS permissions and operations – Retail POS permissions and operations define the tasks that cashiers can perform at the register. For more information about how to set up Retail POS permissions and operations, see [Set up permissions and operations](set-up-permissions-and-operations.md).
