# Maintain loyalty programs in AX 2012 R3

You can also manually adjust loyalty cards to accommodate or reward your customers in the following ways:

  - Manually adjust the rewards that your customer’s are receiving

  - Change the loyalty programs that customers are participating in

  - Update customers’ loyalty tier levels

  - Transfer rewards balances from one loyalty card to another
