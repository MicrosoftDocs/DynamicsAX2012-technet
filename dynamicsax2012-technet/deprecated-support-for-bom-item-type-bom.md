# Deprecated: Support for BOM item type BOM 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, a bill of materials (BOM) can be associated only with items of the BOM item type.

<td><p>Reason for deprecation</p></td>
<td><p>Architectural changes in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 have changed the way that items are defined. Items have become products, and products require a product definition. The product definition consists of a few core characteristics that help identify the product. One characteristic is the product type, which indicates whether a product is tangible (an item) or intangible (a service or rights). In AX 2009, the item type indicated whether the product was tangible (an item) or intangible (a service), and also the role that the item could have (BOM). To guarantee that characteristics are product-related, not product roleâ€“related, the item type attribute was refactored to product type, and the BOM value was separated from the item and service values.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Replaced by another feature</p></td>
<td><p>Yes. The feature has been removed, and a replacement feature is available. Users must still be able to associate a BOM with a product of the item type. Therefore, in AX 2012, customers can associate a BOM with a product of the item type. After this association is made, users can use the new default order type on the default order settings to indicate whether the item that has an associated BOM must be procured or manufactured.</p>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Changes to upgrade</p></td>
<td><p>User who upgrade from AX 2009 to AX 2012 must map existing items to new product definitions. As part of this process, they must decide whether the default order type is purchase or production. The association with a BOM is maintained.</p></td>
