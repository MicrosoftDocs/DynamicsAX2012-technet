_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This topic describes how to view or change the status of all batch jobs in the system.

For example, you may want to change the status of batch jobs to perform actions similar to the following:

  - Temporarily remove a batch job with a status **Waiting** from the waiting list by changing the status to **Withhold**.

  - Restart a job after an error occurs by changing the status to **Waiting**.

  - Run a job that has ended again by changing the status from **Ended** to **Waiting**.

## View or change the status of any batch job

1.  Click **System administration** \> **Inquiries** \> **Batch jobs** \> **Batch jobs**.

2.  Select a batch job from the list.

3.  Click **Functions**, and then select **Change status**.

4.  In the **Select new status** dialog box, select the new status for the job.
