# (RUS) Cash flow management 


This article explains how you can use Cash flow management for Russia for Microsoft Dynamics AX. This functionality is available if you have installed hotfix 3072850 for Russia (RUS).

The Cash flow management process involves the payment processing and includes the following tasks:

  - Configure Cash flow management parameters to support new functionality.

  - Perform a planned payment processing. Automatically creation and update of forecast transactions of forthcoming outpayments and inpayments based on purchase orders, sales orders and free text invoices.

  - Perform a payment request processing (including creation, update, approve) based on indebtedness to vendor, customer, worker and a prepayment requirements from vendors. This task is dependent on the Payment request configuration key being active.

  - Perform a payment schedule journal processing for mid-term liquidity planning (payment plan) and daily payment management (payment register). Cash deficit and surplus analysis through payment schedule sheet balancing (the simulation function).

  - Generate payments based on approved Payment register (a variety of payment schedule journal).

**Example**

In a centralized payments organization, there are many legal entities for operations, and each operating legal entity manages its own invoices payable information. Payment for all the operating legal entities are generated from a single legal entity, which in this example is called the Treasury legal entity. The Treasury department is responsible to monitor the flow of cash/liquidity movement across companies and cash positions, and prevent a corporate cash shortage in good time. The key goals of the Treasury department are:

  - Obtain an accurate liquidity/cash flow forecast and perform an analysis for mid-term/short-term horizon.

  - Manage payments on a daily basis using payment schedule journals.

  - Control the company’s cash position (shortage, surplus).

  - Maintain the company’s cash flows with centralized control.
