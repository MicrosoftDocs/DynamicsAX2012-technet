## Create pages

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Sites Services** \> **Online pages**.

2.  On the Sites Services web site, in the navigation pane, click the solution that you want to add pages to, and then click **Pages**.

3.  In the **Pages** group, click **New page**, select the template that you want, and then click **Next step**.

4.  Enter a page name and a page URL, and then click **Create page**.

5.  Repeat steps 3 and 4 for additional pages that you want to create.

## Manage the pages in a solution

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Sites Services** \> **Available solutions**.
    
    The **Available solutions** form lists all available solutions, including the four solutions that are included with Microsoft Dynamics AX.

2.  In the list of solutions on the left, select a solution, and then click **Available pages**.

3.  On the **Available pages** form, you can view the pages in the solution, their URLs, and information about the records in Microsoft Dynamics AX that are available to the solution or are published on the pages in the solution.

4.  Click **Manage pages online**.

5.  On the Sites Services web site, make the changes that you want to the pages in the solution.
