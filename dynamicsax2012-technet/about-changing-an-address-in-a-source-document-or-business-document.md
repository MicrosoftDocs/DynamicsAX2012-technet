# About changing an address in a source document or business document 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX, each party record can include one or more address records in the party information. For example, a party record might include a billing address, a delivery address, and an alternative delivery address. When you create a source document such, as a sales order, or a business document, such as a purchase order, the address that is displayed in the document by default is the address that you specified for that purpose. However, you can select a different address when you create the document.

Addresses can be added, modified, or set to an inactive status at any time.

**Example**

You generate a sales order for Fabrikam. Fabrikam’s default address is the delivery address, which is the main office address. However, for this sales order, you want to deliver the order to Fabrikam’s warehouse address. You can select the warehouse delivery address in the sales order. If the warehouse address is not already included in the party record, you can add it by using the icons on the **Address** FastTab.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The address that you select or enter to use in this sales order is not set as the default address for future business documents. To change the default address, you must make the appropriate changes in the <STRONG>Advanced</STRONG> form.</P>
