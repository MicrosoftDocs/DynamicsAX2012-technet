2.  On the top of the form, use the filters to find the RFQ replies that you want to follow up on.

3.  Select an RFQ reply line, and then expand the **Multiple requests for quotations** FactBox to see the status of bids from all vendors for the selected RFQ line.

4.  In the **Request for quotation follow-up** form, you can do the following:
    
      - To view the related RFQ, click **RFQ details**.
    
      - To view all the lines in the selected request for quotation reply, click **RFQ reply details**.
