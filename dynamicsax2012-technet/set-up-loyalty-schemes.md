# Set up loyalty schemes 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

This topic explains how to set up loyalty schemes for loyalty programs. A loyalty program can help increase customer loyalty by rewarding customers for buying products in your retail stores. You build a loyalty program by creating loyalty schemes that specify how loyalty points are calculated and managed. You assign the loyalty schemes to loyalty cards. When a customer uses a loyalty card, the loyalty scheme that is applied depends on the loyalty points that are earned and redeemed.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic has been updated to include information about features that were added or changed for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3. For more information, see the section later in this topic.</P>



You can create the following rules to control how loyalty points are calculated:

  - Calculation rule

  - Calculation types

  - Redemption rules

The rules can be applied to specific items, to the total amount of the transaction, or to the number of items in the transaction. You can also assign a fixed number of points per rule.

## Set up loyalty schemes in AX 2012 R2 and AX 2012 Feature Pack

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Common** \> **Loyalty** \> **Loyalty schemes**.

2.  On the **Loyalty schemes** list page, double-click an existing loyalty scheme in the list to open it, or, on the **Action Pane**, click **Loyalty scheme** to create a new loyalty scheme.

3.  In the **Loyalty schemes** form, on the **Loyalty scheme** FastTab, enter the scheme ID, a description, and the calculation data for the loyalty scheme.

4.  On the **Lines** FastTab, click **Add line** to add a new rule to the loyalty scheme.

5.  In the **Type** field, select the type of line that is used to create a rule for a product or a payment method. Select one of the following options:
    
      - **Tender** – Loyalty points are calculated based on the tender that is used. For example, you can create a rule that awards points when cash is used. In the case of a payment, you can create a rule that subtracts points when a customer uses a loyalty card for a purchase.
    
      - **Product** – Loyalty points are calculated based on the product or product variant that is purchased.

6.  Enter the first date and last date that the rule is valid.

7.  Enter the quantity or amount of the line item that qualifies for loyalty points. The loyalty points are defined in the **Loyalty points** column.

8.  In the **Loyalty points** field, enter the loyalty points that are awarded or subtracted when the rule for the line item is applied to the scheme.

## Set up loyalty schemes in AX 2012 R3

In AX 2012 R3, you link loyalty schemes to a loyalty program. Then, in the loyalty scheme, you specify the earning and redemption rules that apply to the loyalty program. You also assign retail channels to the loyalty scheme to identify the loyalty program that the retail store is participating in.

Loyalty schemes are no longer assigned to specific loyalty cards. Instead a loyalty card is linked to one or more loyalty programs and the loyalty program is linked to a loyalty scheme.

To set up loyalty schemes in AX 2012 R3, following these steps:

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Common** \> **Loyalty** \> **Loyalty schemes**. On the **Loyalty schemes** list page, double-click a loyalty scheme in the list to open it, or, on the **Action Pane**, click **Loyalty scheme** to create a new loyalty scheme.

2.  In the **Loyalty schemes** form, on the **General** FastTab, enter a scheme ID and description. Then in the **Loyalty program** field, select a loyalty program to assign to the loyalty scheme. Loyalty programs include the discounts and loyalty tiers that apply to a loyalty scheme. For more information about how to set up loyalty programs, see [Set up loyalty programs](set-up-loyalty-programs.md).

3.  On the **Earning rules** FastTab, click **Add line**, and then enter the earning activities that earn loyalty rewards for the customer. Earning rules can be specific to a loyalty program tier.

4.  On the **Redemption rules** FastTab, click **Add line**, and then enter the rules that determine how a customer can redeem loyalty rewards. For example, a customer can purchase one dollar’s worth of products for every reward point that they spend. Redemption rules can be specific to a loyalty program tier.

    <p>For example, customers who are part of a <strong>Gold</strong> level tier might be able to redeem their rewards points for any product, while standard loyalty customers might be restricted to redeeming their rewards for products in a certain category. By specifying the gold tier in the <strong>Program tier</strong> field and entering the appropriate rule criteria, customers who are in the gold level tier in the loyalty program can redeem their rewards points for additional products.</p>
    <p>If you don’t select a program tier, the redemption rule applies to all customers who are participating in the loyalty program.</p></td>

5.  On the **Retail channels** FastTab, click **Add line**, and then select the retail channels that the loyalty scheme applies to.
    
    You can select individual retail channels or you can select portions of the retail organization hierarchy. If you use the hierarchy, the loyalty scheme is automatically applied when retail channels are added to the hierarchy. If you select individual retail channels, you need to add the new retail channels to this form when they are created.

To apply the loyalty scheme to the channels, you must process the loyalty scheme. To process the loyalty scheme, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Periodic** \> **Loyalty** \> **Process loyalty schemes**.

2.  In the **Process loyalty schemes** form, select the appropriate settings, and then click **OK**.
