# (BRA) Create and post a purchase order for a foreign vendor 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use this procedure to create and post a purchase order for a foreign vendor. Before you post the purchase order to import items, you must specify the import declaration information (the addition number and import declaration number) to generate an import fiscal document. An import fiscal document records transit information about the items that you import. This document is used to release the items from customs, and to validate the entry of the items in the warehouse of the legal entity.

Before you can create and post the purchase order for a foreign vendor, you must select the **Generate incoming fiscal document** check box on the **Fiscal information** FastTab in the **Vendors** form.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In AX 2012 R3 and cumulative update 6 or later for AX 2012 R2: You can also issue an import fiscal document when you create a purchase order to import services from a foreign vendor.</P>
