# (RUS) Settle partial payments for customers 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use this procedure to settle partial payment transactions for a customer. You can settle a partial payment against a particular invoice line, and you can settle open transactions by using a periodic settlement for customers. Exchange adjustment factures are created for the invoice lines that are settled.

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Journals** \> **Payments** \> **Payment journal**.

2.  Create or select a payment journal line, and then click **Lines** to open the **Journal voucher** form. For more information, see [Key tasks: Customer payments and settlements](key-tasks-customer-payments-and-settlements.md).

3.  Click **Mark invoice lines** to open the **Mark invoice lines** form.

4.  Select the **Mark** check box to mark the transaction line for settlement.

5.  In the **Amount to settle** field, view or modify the partial payment that has to be settled.

6.  Click **OK** to settle the partial settlement for the customer.

7.  Click **Post** \> **Post** to post the customer payment journal and settle the payment amount.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>To verify that the exchange adjustment facture that is created has the same settled invoice amount in the <STRONG>Facture journal</STRONG> form, select the facture.</P>



8.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Periodic** \> **Sales book** \> **Sales books journal**.
