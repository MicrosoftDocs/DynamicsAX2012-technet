## Create a payment proposal for customers who have direct debit mandates

You can use the **Payment journal** form to create a payment proposal for customers who have direct debit mandates.

To create a payment proposal, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Journals** \> **Payments** \> **Payment journal**.

2.  Select a journal name, and then click **Lines**.

3.  Select a journal line, and then click **Payment proposal** \> **Create payment proposal**.

4.  In the **Customer payment proposal** form, click **Select**.

5.  In the **Customer payment proposal query** form, in the **Criteria** field, select the criteria for the customer transactions.

6.  To add restrictions to select documents by mandate scheme or payment frequency, in the upper pane, right-click the **Customer transactions** table in the tree and add the **Customer direct debit mandates** table. Enter criteria, and then click **OK**.

7.  In the **Customer payment proposal** form, enter other information for the payment proposal as needed, and then click **OK**.

8.  Click **Functions** \> **Generate payments**.

9.  In the **Generate payments** form, select **Payment method**, and then in the **Method of payment** field, select a method of payment that requires a mandate.

10. Select **Export payment using service**, and then in the **Payment format** field, select an export format such as **SEPADirectDebit** to generate payments by using the payment format.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can create payment formats for Application Integration Framework (AIF) services in the <STRONG>Outbound ports for electronic payments</STRONG> form.</P>



11. In the **Bank account** field, select the bank account for SEPA direct debit.

12. Click **OK** to open the **Payment processing data** form.

13. In the **Payment processing data** form, modify the information that is specific to the SEPA direct debit payment format.

14. In AX 2012 R3 and cumulative update 7 or later for AX 2012 R2: To generate the country-specific or region-specific version of the direct debit file, in the **Value** field, enter the two-digit country or region code. Leave this field blank to use the generic direct debit file format.

15. Select the **Control report** check box to print a control report for the electronic payment file.

16. Click **OK** to generate the electronic payment file in the format of the selected country.
    
    Payments are generated, and the payment status in the **Journal voucher** form changes to **Sent**.

17. Click **Post** \> **Post**. Payments are posted. The usage count for each customer mandate is incremented. If a payment is settled with two invoices, the usage count is incremented by two, even though only one payment is used. If a payment is settled for another legal entity, the usage count is updated in the invoice.

## Print the mandate information for customer transactions

To verify mandate information for customer transactions and print the mandate information, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Customers** \> **All customers**.

2.  Double-click a customer account.

3.  On the **Direct debit mandates** FastTab, double-click a mandate to verify the mandate information. The usage count for the customerâ€™s mandate is automatically updated when the payment is posted.

4.  To view the remaining invoices for the selected mandate, click **Print** \> **Notification report**.

5.  Click **OK** to print the mandate information.
