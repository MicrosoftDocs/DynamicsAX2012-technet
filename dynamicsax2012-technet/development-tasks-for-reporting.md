# Development Tasks for Reporting 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Microsoft Dynamics AX provides a model-based approach for creating reports by providing project templates and modeling tools that are incorporated into the Microsoft Visual Studio development environment. The reporting features provided by Microsoft Dynamics AX are tightly integrated with SQL ServerÂ Reporting Services.

Reporting Services is a server-based reporting platform that provides comprehensive reporting functionality for a variety of data sources. The reporting framework includes a set of tools for you to define reports in the Microsoft Visual Studio development environment. The report development experience takes advantage of extended SQL Server tools and components fully integrated into the Microsoft Visual Studio environment. By using the reporting APIs, you can integrate or extend data and report processing in custom applications. The following table provides links to more information on these Microsoft technologies:
