# Create production pools 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Set up production pools as a way to group production orders into various useful categories. For example, these categories can be used in the following ways:

  - As an internal notation system

  - To create pools that contain urgent or top priority production orders

  - To sort or filter production information

  - To be assigned to a default posting profile that defines how you want to post transactions for production orders in the pool

## Create a production pool

1.  Click **Production control** \> **Setup** \> **Production** \> **Production pools**.

2.  Click **New** or press CTRL+N to create a new line.

3.  In the **Pool** field, enter an identifier for the production pool.

4.  In the **Name** field, enter a descriptive name for the production pool.
