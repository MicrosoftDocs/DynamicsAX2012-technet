## View item requirements by using a period template

In the **Net requirements** form, you can view requirements by using a period template. Use the following procedure to configure and use this functionality.

1.  Create and set up a period template. For more information, see [Period templates (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh209650\(v=ax.60\)). To group item requirements, you can set up, for example, one period of 5 days and another period of 3 weeks.

2.  Assign the period template to a coverage group. Click **Master planning** \> **Setup** \> **Coverage** \> **Coverage groups**. Select the coverage group. On the **General** FastTab, in the **Period template** field, select the period template that you want to use.

3.  In the **Net requirements** form, click the **Period** tab to view the requirements by using the format of the period template that you selected. The item requirements are displayed in the periods that are defined by the period template.
    
    If you do not assign a period template to a coverage group, the grid on the **Period** tab is blank.
