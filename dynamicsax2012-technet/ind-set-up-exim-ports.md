# (IND) Set up EXIM ports 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Set up the export and import (EXIM) port authorities that you reference in export and import transactions when you apply for Advanced Authorization (AA), Duty Free Import Authorization (DFIA), Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG), or Duty Drawback (DBK) incentives.

  - Before you set up the EXIM port authority data for DBK incentives, you must create a customer account and customer bank account for the port authority. For more information about how to set up a customer account and customer bank account, see [Create a customer record](create-a-customer-record.md) and [Set up a bank account for a customer account](set-up-a-bank-account-for-a-customer-account.md).

  - To access the **EXIM ports** form, you must first activate incentive schemes. In the **General ledger parameters** form, in the **Sales tax** area, on the **General** FastTab, select the **Activate incentive schemes** check box.
