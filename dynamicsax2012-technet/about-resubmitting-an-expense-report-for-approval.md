# About resubmitting an expense report for approval 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When an expense report is returned to you without approval, you can respond to the changes or issues that are listed by the approver in the workflow history and then resubmit the report for approval.

If you have to change or add itemized transactions to a line item approval, you must first cancel the workflow actions to remove the expense report from the workflow process. After you make the appropriate changes to the expense report, you can resubmit your expense report for approval by using the workflow process.
