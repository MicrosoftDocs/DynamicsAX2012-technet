The .xml file is then converted to the Offentlig Information Online Universal Business Language (OIOUBL) format. You can generate electronic invoices for customers for whom you have specified a European Article Numbering (EAN) number in the **EAN** field and selected the **eInvoice** check box in the **Customers** form.

The resulting OIOUBL files are created in the shared folder that is specified for the **EInvoiceFileTransform\_OIOUBL** batch job task for the sales order batch job.
