To design a screen layout, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Retail essentials** \> **Channels** \> **Setup** \> **POS** \> **Screen layouts**.

2.  To create a new layout, press CTRL+N, and then, in the **Screen layout ID** field, type an ID for the layout. To modify an existing layout, select the layout. Then click **Designer**.

3.  Click **Design mode**, and then click **Main layout**. The following parts are available:
    
      - **Empty Space Item** – Insert space between parts.
    
      - **Label** – Insert a text label.
    
      - **Separator** – Insert a separator between parts.

      - **Keyboard Input** – This part is not used.
    
      - **Logo1** to **Logo5** – One or more image boxes that display the company’s logo or other selected images.
    
      - **Message** – A pane that displays a message whenever a function is performed in Retail essentials.
    
      - **Receipt** – A pane that displays sales information, such as the item number, product name, price, and sales tax.
    
      - **Numpad** – A pane that displays an input field and an onscreen number pad. This part can be used to enter item numbers, bar codes, and product quantities. You can also search for products and customers.

4.  Select a part, and then drag the part onto the layout designer.
    
    **Examples**
    
      - Select **Receipt**, and then drag this part onto the layout designer. **Receipt** no longer appears in the **Customization** form, because each layout can have only one receipt part.
    
      - Select **Label**, and then drag this part onto the layout designer. **Label** still appears in the **Customization** form, because each layout can have several label parts.

When you release the mouse button while the pointer is over this line, the button grid appears there. After the button grid appears in the layout designer window, you can change the size of the button grid.</P>

    
    To remove a part from the layout, drag the part back into the **Customization** form.

5.  After you have finished designing the **Main layout** section, you can design the **Customer layout** section. Click **Design mode**, and then click **Customer layout**.
    
    The following parts are available:
