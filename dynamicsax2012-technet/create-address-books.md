# Create address books 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This topic describes how to create address books and assign teams or grant privileges to address books by legal entity. Before you create address books for your organization, or import information for party records, we recommend that you determine the number and types of address books that your organization requires. You can then grant privileges to each address book.

After your organization determines the number and types of address books that are required, and you set the default parameters for the address books, you can create one or more address books.

This topic assumes that you have completed planning address books for your organization, and are familiar with the content in the [Global address books and address reference data](global-address-books-and-address-reference-data.md) topic. This topic also assumes that you have set up parameters for address books. This includes security parameters. For more information, see [Set up global address book parameters](set-up-global-address-book-parameters.md).
