# cloud[AX 2012]

The collection of hardware and software that enables the five essential characteristics (on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service) of cloud computing. The cloud infrastructure can be viewed as containing both a physical layer and an abstraction layer. The physical layer consists of the hardware resources that are necessary to support the cloud services being provided, and typically includes server, storage and network components. The abstraction layer consists of the software deployed across the physical layer, which manifests the essential cloud characteristics. Conceptually the abstraction layer sits above the physical layer.
