# (RUS) Set up a register for accounts payable movement 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

The **Accounts payable movement** register is a summary of information about an accounts payable movement that is considered to be an expense under the RF tax code. You must set up the exchange and amount difference parameters before you calculate the accounts payable registers.

The register entries reflect all of the taxpayer's accounts payable transactions made between the beginning of the tax reporting period and the reporting date. Entries are created for each instance of debt revaluation for vouchers in a foreign currency. The taxpayer's accounts payable amounts at various levels budgets are not displayed in this register. The register should be maintained to allow grouping of information about the object and naming (type) of vouchers that result in the occurrence of accounts payable, creating an unsettled accounts payable amount at the reporting date, and specifying all accounts payable that have an expired claim term or are subject to amortization for other reasons on the accounting date.
