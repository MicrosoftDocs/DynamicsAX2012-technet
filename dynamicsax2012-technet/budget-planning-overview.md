# Budget planning overview 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

This topic introduces budget planning and contains information to help you configure budget planning and set up budget planning processes.

## About budget planning

Budget planning is the process of preparing the budgets that are implemented by an organization. Private sector and public sector organizations can configure budget planning, and then set up budget planning processes to meet their organization’s policies, procedures, and requirements for budget preparation. You can use budget planning to perform the following tasks:

  - Associate budget planning processes with budget cycles, ledgers, and organization hierarchies.

  - Analyze and update budget plans by using multiple scenarios. You can automatically route the budget plans, together with worksheets, justifications, and attachments, for review and approval.

  - Consolidate multiple budget plans from a lower level of the organization into a single parent budget plan at a higher level in the organization. You can also develop a single budget plan at a higher level of the organization and allocate the budget to lower levels of the organization.

When you use budget planning, budget planning rules are added to advanced rules and account structures, and budget planning tasks and elements are added to Budgeting workflows. The **Budget planning** and **Security** purposes are also added to organization hierarchies.

Budget planning is integrated with other modules, so you can bring in information from previous budgets, actual expenditures, fixed assets, and human resources. Budget planning is also integrated with Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word, so that you can use these tools to work with the budget planning data. For example, a budget manager can import a department’s budget request into an Excel worksheet from a budget plan scenario. The data can be analyzed, updated, and charted in the worksheet, and then published back to the budget plan lines.

## Budget planning requirements

The **Budget** configuration key for basic budgeting and the **Budget planning configuration key** must be enabled. The **Budget control** configuration key is optional but is typically enabled. For more information, see [Configuration keys](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh227464\(v=ax.60\)) and “Budgeting configuration keys” in [Setup overview: basic budgeting and budget control](setup-overview-basic-budgeting-and-budget-control.md).

Before you configure budget planning and set up budget planning processes, you must set up basic budgeting. You must also set up budget control if you’re using budget control. When you set up basic budgeting, include the financial dimensions, number sequences, budget cycles, and currency exchange rates for budget planning. For overview information, see [Setup overview: basic budgeting and budget control](setup-overview-basic-budgeting-and-budget-control.md). For a list of topics about basic budgeting, see [Setting up basic budgeting](setting-up-basic-budgeting.md).

The following table describes the information that you must compile before you configure budget planning and set up budget planning processes.

> [!NOTE]
> <P>We recommend that you use Management Reporter for Microsoft Dynamics ERP to create, maintain, deploy, and view financial reports that include budget planning data. Management Reporter lets you design financial reports based on ledger accounts and financial dimensions, drill down to transaction-level detail, and use web-based report viewing. For more information about how to print financial reports by using Management Reporter, see <A href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=324762">Management Reporter for Microsoft Dynamics ERP</A>.</P>
> <P>You can use Management Reporter to report on budget planning data only if you have rollup 4 or a later version of Management Reporter 2012 installed.</P>
