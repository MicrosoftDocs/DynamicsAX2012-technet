# Set up a distribution location list 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

Distribution locations represent the destinations for distributed data. In general, you must have a distribution location for each store location that has its own database.

Create a list of distribution locations to group locations for data distribution. For example, you can create a distribution location list that contains all your retail stores. You can then use Retail Scheduler to run data distribution jobs for all locations in the list.
