# About service object groups 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Object groups are useful for sorting and filtering the data about objects for reports and statistics. For example, you can group objects by geographical location or by type.

## Group by geographical location

You can use this grouping method to show where the various different objects that your company services are located. Grouping objects by geographical location can also be useful if, for example, you must identify the objects that your company already provides services for in a particular country/region.

## Example

A customer from Belgium calls your service center and wants to create a service agreement for an object, ABC. You have attached an object group for geographical location, Belgium, to all objects that are serviced in Belgium. By using this group as a filter, you can quickly search to see whether you already have a record for ABC in the program, or whether you must set up a new object. For more information about filtering, see [Filter records](filter-records.md).

## Group by type

You can use this grouping method to show the types of objects that your company services. Grouping objects by type can also be useful if, for example, you want to create a new object based on similar objects that already exist in the program.

## Example

A customer calls and wants to set up a service agreement for an air conditioning machine, HIJ. You do not already have a record for this machine. However, you have set up an object group titled Air Conditioners, and you have attached this group to all air conditioning objects. Therefore, you can quickly search for and identify all other air conditioning machines and use the template information from these objects to create service agreement lines for HIJ. By using object groups in this manner, you can quickly set up new objects and determine the service tasks that must be performed on them. For more information about searching and filtering, see [Filter records](filter-records.md).
