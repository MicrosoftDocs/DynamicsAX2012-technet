# About designing questionnaires 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A carefully designed questionnaire can help increase the quality of the data that you collect. Through careful design, you can better select the appropriate options at the appropriate time for a questionnaire.

When you plan out a questionnaire, do the following:

  - Clearly define the purpose of the questionnaire to make sure that you include useful questions.

  - Write questions that will appear on the questionnaire and include answer choices, if applicable.

  - Be sure that the questionnaire has a logical flow and keeps respondents interested.

  - Arrange questions and answers in the order that they should be presented to respondents.

  - Determine the individual person or group of people who should complete the questionnaire.

  - Decide how the results should be evaluated, if applicable.

  - Consider any additional features, such as how results should be categorized, if a time limit is needed, or if all questions will be mandatory.

## Design a questionnaire

The design phase of the questionnaire process in Microsoft Dynamics AX has four main steps:

1.  Set up prerequisites, as needed.

2.  Set up answer groups and answers, if applicable.

3.  Set up questions and their association with the answer groups.

4.  Set up the questionnaire itself and attach questions to it.
