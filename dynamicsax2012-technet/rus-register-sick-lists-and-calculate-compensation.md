# (RUS) Register sick lists and calculate compensation 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

This topic describes how to register a sick list that indicates that an employee is temporarily incapacitated due to illness, injury, pregnancy, child care, or other reasons.

Sick lists can be registered only for those employees who are insured by the social insurance fund. After the Human Resources department processes sick list registrations, the payroll department can use the sick list registration details to calculate and pay benefits and compensation to employees. Social allowances or compensation for employees can be paid by one of the following three sources:

  - Social insurance fund: When the legal entity hires an employee, the employee is registered with the social insurance fund. When a legal entity pays an employee, the legal entity contributes a certain amount as insurance to the social insurance fund for any incapacity that might happen to the employee in future. When the employee is sick, the legal entity pays the social insurance allowance to the employee and reduces the contribution amount to the social insurance fund.

  - Federal budget: The federal budget pays an allowance to an employee, not for their inability to work, but for other reasons. For example, an employee who is a parent of a child with a disability can receive an allowance from the federal budget. The federal government can ask the social insurance authorities to fund the employee for the allowance amount. Later, the social insurance fund can raise an invoice for the allowance amount to the federal government.

  - Legal entity: The legal entity can voluntarily increase the allowance by paying it from the wage fund. This will compensate the employee for the difference between the social pay and the base salary. The benefit amount is divided across the payment period and the payment sources, such as the social insurance fund or wage fund. After the sick list is added to the salary, it is processed at the start of the sick list calculation.

11. In the **Institution type** field, select **Customer** or **Vendor** as the type of a medical institution.

12. In the **Institution Code** field, select the identification code of the selected institution type that determines the medical organization.

13. On the **Calculation** tab, in the **Salary Report** field group, you can modify the details of prior earnings, if required. You can also define the average earnings period, value, and source details. Based on the selected values, you can view the average earnings details and the recalculated allowance amount details in the **Benefit due** field group.

14. Select the **Add to salary** check box to include the registered sick list in the current payroll calculation.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You cannot modify the sick list once it is included in the current payroll calculation</P>



15. Click **Calculation** to define the criteria for starting the sick list calculation procedure to include the total benefit amount in the **Payments and deductions registration** form. Make sure that the sick list compensation calculations also depend on the following criteria:
    
    1.  Rules that are defined for social seniority of the employee. You can define the sick list seniority compensation dates in the **Worker** form.
    
    2.  The years of payment contributions to the social insurance fund.
    
    3.  The period for which the employee is insured under the social insurance fund.

16. Click **Hours worked accounting** to view the work hour details for the employee during the selected calculation period in the **Resulting information about employee worked hours** form.

17. You can click **Adjust storno** to process the storno adjustment for the registered sick list number in the prior period’s documents.

## If required: Perform storno adjustment and recalculate the sick lists

The recalculation of sick lists and posting of additional charges are performed if calculation parameters are modified prior to the end date of a sick list. When you use the **Recalculation of sick lists** form, a periodic operation occurs that reports the number of recalculated sick lists created, and compares the recalculated sick list with the initial sick list. Several recalculations may exist for one sick list.

To perform storno adjustment of the registered sick lists, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Calculation procedures** \> **Sick lists** \> **Sick lists**.

2.  Select the sick list that is included in the payroll in one of the previous payroll periods, and then click **Adjust storno**. The storno sick list is created and automatically added to the current payroll calculation.

3.  Click **Recalculation** to recalculate the payroll and view storno transactions in the results of the payroll calculation.

To generate the sick lists details with storno adjustment details, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Periodic** \> **Recalculation of sick lists**.

2.  Click **Select** to open the **Inquiry** form, and then enter the selection criteria to recalculate the sick lists that are added to the salary. Click **OK**.

3.  In the **Recalculation of sick lists** form, click **OK** to generate two new recalculation sick list lines that are created for each recalculated sick list in the **Sick lists** form.

## If required: Recalculate modified sick list details and print the sick list report

To recalculate and include the modified sick list details for the employee in the **Recent transactions** form, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Payroll calculation** \> **Recent transactions**.

2.  Click **New** to create a transaction.

3.  In the **Employee** field, select the employee code.

4.  In the **Procedure code** field, select the calculation procedure code for a sick list.

5.  Click **Recalculate current** to recalculate personal income taxes for only the selected employee.
    
    –or–
    
    Click **Recalculate all** to recalculate personal income tax for all employees.

To print the sick list report, follow these steps:

1.  Select the registered sick list.

2.  Click **Print** to open the **Sick lists report** form.

3.  Select the **Directly to printer** check box to send the sick list details to the printer.

4.  Click **Select** to define the employee average earnings calculation criteria for the specified sick list number.

5.  Click **OK** to print the sick list report.

## Next step

You have registered a sick list. Continue to register related payments, and then continue to manage pay statements. For more information, see [(RUS) Generate pay statements](rus-generate-pay-statements.md).
