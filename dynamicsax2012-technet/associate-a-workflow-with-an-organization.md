# Associate a workflow with an organization 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Some workflows are used to process documents that are associated with your whole organization. However, other workflows are used to process documents that are associated with a specific organization, such as a legal entity. For this kind of workflow, follow these steps to select the specific organization that the documents in the workflow are associated with.

To view a list of organization-specific workflows, see [Workflow types](workflow-types.md).

2.  Click **Setup** \> **\[Module name\] workflows**. A list page is displayed.

3.  Select the workflow to associate with a specific organization.

4.  On the Action Pane, click **Associate**. The **Workflow association** form is displayed.

5.  Select the organization to use the selected workflow with.

6.  Click **Associate**.
