# Settle a promissory note 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can settle a remitted promissory note when it is due.

## Settle a promissory note in a journal

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Journals** \> **Promissory notes** \> **Settle promissory note journal**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a journal, or select a journal.

3.  On the **Promissory note** tab, select the bank account that was used when the promissory note was remitted.

4.  Click **Lines**.

5.  In the **Journal voucher** form, select the vendor account for the invoice, and then click **Functions** \> **Settlement**.

6.  In the **Settle open transactions** form, select the check box in the **Mark** field for the remitted transaction from the invoice. Close the form to transfer the transaction to the journal line.

7.  In the **Journal voucher** form, click **Post** \> **Post**.

A new line with a status of **Honored** and a sequence number of 1 or higher is created for the remitted promissory note and is shown in the **Promissory note journal** form. In the **Promissory note statistics** form, the number in the **Honored documents** row is increased, and the number in the **Remitted and remitted-confirmed documents** row is decreased.

When you settle a remitted promissory note, the remitted promissory notes summary account is debited and the bank summary account is credited. When you settle an invoice-remitted invoice, the invoice-remitted summary account is debited and the vendor summary account is credited.

(ESP) Conditional sales tax is posted when you settle a promissory note that is drawn for a customer invoice on which conditional sales tax is applied. You can view the conditional sales tax that is posted for the payment in the **Voucher transactions** form.

2.  Select a bank account. On the Action Pane, click the **Manage payments** tab, and then click **Vendor remittances**.
