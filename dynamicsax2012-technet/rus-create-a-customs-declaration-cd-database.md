# (RUS) Create a customs declaration (CD) database 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can track customs declarations (CDs) from the time that goods arrive at the customs terminal to the time that the goods are shipped to the end customer.

You must activate the corresponding inventory dimension in the item's inventory dimension group to perform CD accounting using the **Inventory dimensions** form. When goods are received, their custom declaration numbers are entered manually. When goods are sold, the custom declaration ID is determined automatically, depending on the item lot. The custom declaration ID that was used when the goods were purchased is displayed on documents when the goods are sold.

You must enter CD numbers into a corresponding database and enter item names and their country or region of origin before registering custom declaration numbers for the newly received goods.
