# Create service accounts 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

An implementation of Microsoft Dynamics AX requires many services to run. Set up accounts to run the services. Each account that you set up must have the following characteristics:

  - Unless otherwise noted, it must be a dedicated account. A dedicated account is used only for a specific service.

  - It must have a password that does not expire.

  - It must have minimal access to network resources.

  - It must be able to log on as a service.

If you are using Windows Server 2008 R2 or a later version of Windows Server, you can use managed service accounts. For more information, see the [Service Accounts Step-by-Step Guide](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=214033) on TechNet.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If an account must be a Microsoft Dynamics AX user, it cannot be a managed service account.</P>



The accounts in this topic must be configured in order to install the components of Microsoft Dynamics AX. For information about additional service accounts that are used when you configure Microsoft Dynamics AX, see [Configure system accounts](configure-system-accounts.md).

## Create accounts for Microsoft Dynamics AX services

Create the accounts in the following table to run Microsoft Dynamics AX services.

<td><p>Application Object Server (AOS) service account</p></td>
<td><p>The account that the <strong>Microsoft Dynamics AX Object Server</strong>Â Windows service runs as. This account is used to communicate with the database server.</p>
<p>Consider the following points when you select an account:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We strongly recommend that you use a domain account or a managed service account in a production environment. Use the Network Service account only in development and testing environments.</p></li>
<li><p>If you plan to use a managed service account, you must first create that account as described in the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=254376">Service Accounts Step-by-Step guide</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>If Microsoft SQL Server and the AOS are on different computers, you must use a domain account or a managed service account.</p></li>
<li><p>If you plan to install any Microsoft Dynamics AX components on a domain controller, you must use a domain account.</p></li>
<li><p>If you plan to use Message Queuing, which is also known as MSMQ, for document exchange with web services on Internet Information Services (IIS), and you want to send signed messages, you must use a domain account. However, if you want to send unsigned messages by using web services on IIS, the AOS can run under the Network Service account.</p></li>
