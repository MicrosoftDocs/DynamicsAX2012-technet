# (RUS) Set up an intermediate bank account for a foreign vendor 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can use the **Vendor bank accounts** form to set up a foreign bank account for a vendor, so that you can make payments by using payment orders or payment requests. This bank account is registered with the foreign bank that is linked to the vendor account. For more information, see [(RUS) Set up a foreign bank](rus-set-up-a-foreign-bank.md).

You can also set up an intermediate Russian bank account to link to the vendor payments that are made to the foreign bank. You can specify a bank code, an account number, and a Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) code for the foreign bank that the payments are made to.

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Common** \> **Vendors** \> **All vendors**.

2.  Select the vendor account that is linked to the foreign bank, and then click **Set up** \> **Bank accounts** to open the **Vendor bank accounts** form.

3.  Create a bank account for the vendor.

4.  On the **General** FastTab, in the **Foreign bank** field group, in the **Bank groups** field, select the code of the foreign bank with which the vendor bank account is registered.

5.  In the **Bank account number** field, enter the bank account number of the vendor.

6.  In the **SWIFT** field, enter the SWIFT code of the bank.
