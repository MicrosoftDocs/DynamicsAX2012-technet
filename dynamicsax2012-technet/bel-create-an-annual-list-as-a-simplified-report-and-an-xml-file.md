# (BEL) Create an annual list as a simplified report and an .xml file 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Customers who are obligated to pay value-added tax (VAT) must submit the Invoice turnover report.

Use the **Invoice turnover report** report to print a simplified report and an optional XML report that lists the sales transactions in a year. This information is retrieved from sales invoices and can, if necessary, be corrected before reporting.

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Periodic** \> **Sales tax payments** \> **Belgium** \> **Invoice turnover**.

2.  In the **From date** and **To date** fields, select a starting date and an ending date for the report.

3.  In the **Minimum amount** field, enter the minimum amount to report.

4.  Select the **Official declaration** check box to print an official declaration.

5.  Select the **Create XML file** check box to generate the report as an XML file and a simplified annual list report.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If you do not select this check box, only a simplified annual list report is printed.</P>



6.  In the **File name** field, select or enter the location and file name for the XML file.

7.  To replace a previously submitted declaration, in the **Replaced Invoice turnover declaration** field, enter the invoice number of the previous invoice turnover declaration that is to be replaced.

8.  Click **OK** to print the annual report.
