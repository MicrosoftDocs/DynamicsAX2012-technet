## How to filter the data on this report

When you generate this report, the following default parameters are displayed. You can use these parameters to filter the data that will be displayed on the report. For more information, see [Filter the data on a report](filter-the-data-on-a-report.md).

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Field</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>From transaction date</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Enter the starting date of the interval for which to print the report. Because a fiscal journal is always printed for the calendar year, the fiscal year and the page numbering of the report start on January 1 of the year entered in the <strong>From date</strong> field. However, the <strong>From date</strong> to <strong>To date</strong> range applies, which means that only pages with transactions dated in the selected range are printed.</p>
<p>For example, if the <strong>From date</strong> is February 1, 2011, and 15 pages are printed during the period of January 1 to 31, 2011, the number of the first page of the report printed for a period beginning February 1 will be 16. If the <strong>From date</strong> is January 1, the first page of the report will be page 1.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>To transaction date</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Enter the ending date of the interval for which to print the report.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>All year</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Select this check box to use automatic page numbering within the current fiscal year. Clear the check box to use the user-defined field setup in the <strong>Follow previous</strong> section.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Include current</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Select this check box to include transactions with a <strong>Current</strong> posting layer.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">

<td><p>Select this check box to include transactions with an <strong>Operations</strong> posting layer.</p></td>

<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Include tax</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Select this check box to include transactions with a <strong>Tax</strong> posting layer.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">

<td><p>Select the relevant check boxes to modify the <strong>Change to</strong> fields.</p>
