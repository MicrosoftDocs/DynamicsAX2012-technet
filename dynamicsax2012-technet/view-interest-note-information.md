_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

If a customer does not pay an invoice amount even after they receive a collection letter, your organization might want to charge interest on the late payment. In addition, you can charge a fee for each calculation of the interest amount, and add this fee to the interest amount.

You can use the **Interest notes** page to view a list of interest notes, and then use the **View interest note** page to view the details and transactions for a specific interest note. You can also export interest note data to Microsoft Excel.

1.  Click **Sales** on the top link bar, and then click **Customers** on the Quick Launch. The **All customers** page is displayed.

2.  Select a customer account for which interest notes have been created.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Sell** tab, click **Interest notes**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If the <STRONG>Block</STRONG> check box is selected on the <STRONG>Interest notes</STRONG> page, no additional invoices can be issued for this customer account until the account is no longer blocked. You can change this field in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client.</P>



4.  To view the details of an interest note, select a note. On the **Action Pane**, on the **Interest note** tab, click **Interest note**. On the **View interest note** page, you can view more information about the interest note. This includes the transaction details.
