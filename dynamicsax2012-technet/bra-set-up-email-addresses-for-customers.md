For more information, see [Create, update, or delete location addresses and contact information purposes](create-update-or-delete-location-addresses-and-contact-information-purposes.md).

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Customers** \> **All customers**.

2.  Create or select a customer account, and then click **Edit**. For more information, see [Create a customer record](create-a-customer-record.md).

3.  On the **Contact information** FastTab, click **Add**.

4.  In the **Description** field, enter a description for the email address of the customer.

5.  In the **Type** field, select **E-mail address**.

6.  In the **Contact number/address** field, enter the email address of the customer to send the electronic invoice to.

7.  Click **More options**, and then click **Advanced** to open the **Edit contact information** form.

8.  In the left pane, select the email contact record that you created for the customer.
