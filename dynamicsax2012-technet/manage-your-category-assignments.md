A customer can use procurement categories to classify the items and services that the customer purchases from you. When you are approved as a vendor for a customer, you are also approved to provide items and services only in specific procurement categories.

You can view procurement categories that are assigned to you in the Vendor portal. You can also submit a request to be assigned to additional procurement categories on the Vendor portal. You might need to complete a questionnaire about your ability to meet procurement category requirements.

## View your category assignments

1.  On the **Home** page, on the Quick Launch, click **Profile**.

2.  On the **Edit profile** page, expand the **Category information** FastTab.

3.  On the **Category information** FastTab, you can view procurement categories assigned to you, your status in a category, and the period in which you are authorized to provide products in a category.
