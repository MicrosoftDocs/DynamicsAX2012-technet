# (RUS) Set up a matching priority and a number sequence to calculate a storage service amount 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use the **Accounts receivable parameters** form to set up a matching priority to calculate the storage service amount. You also use this form to assign a number sequence to the storage calculation operations journal.

Matching priorities are search criteria that are established for the combinations of items, warehouses, or customer relations. Based on these combinations, the calculation item is searched, and the storage service amount is calculated. For more information, see [(RUS) Calculation of the storage service amount for items](rus-calculation-of-the-storage-service-amount-for-items.md).

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Accounts receivable parameters**.

2.  In the **Matching priority of calculation item** field, select a matching priority for the calculation item that is used to calculate the storage service amount.

3.  Click the **Number sequences** link.

4.  In the **Number sequence code** field, select a number sequence for the **Storage calculation** reference type.
