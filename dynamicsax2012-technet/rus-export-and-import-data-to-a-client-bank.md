_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can use the electronic exchange format to make client bank payments in Microsoft Dynamics AX. The electronic exchange format lets you interface with multiple bank templates to transfer electronic payments.

Complete the following tasks before you create a client bank payment transaction:

  - Set up a bank account for a company. For more information, see [(RUS) Set up bank accounts](rus-set-up-bank-accounts.md) and [Bank accounts (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa587660\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Set up currency and exchange rates. For more information, see [Currency exchange rates (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh209477\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Set up the terms of payment for a payment transaction. For more information, see [Terms of payment (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa588427\(v=ax.60\)).
