# (HUN) Create and post a free text invoice with a specific VAT register date 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

When you post an outgoing invoice, you can select a date for reporting value-added tax (VAT) that differs from the transaction date on invoice lines. Use this procedure to create and post a free text invoice that has a specific VAT register date.

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Free text invoices** \> **All free text invoices**. On the **Action Pane**, in the **New** group, click **Free text invoice**.

2.  In the **Free text invoice** form, in the **Date of VAT register** field, select the date on which to report the invoice VAT.

3.  Enter the required invoice details. For more information, see [(HUN) Free text invoice (modified form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj664332\(v=ax.60\)) and [Create free text invoices](create-free-text-invoices.md).

4.  After you enter the invoice lines to post, on the **Action Pane**, click **Post**.

5.  In the **Post free text invoice** form, select posting options, and then click **OK** to post the invoice.

When you post an invoice that includes outgoing tax that will be posted on a future date, the amount of VAT is posted to a temporary account. Later, on the VAT register date that you selected, it is posted to the VAT account.
