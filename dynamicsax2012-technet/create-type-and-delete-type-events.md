## Example: Record has been created

Every time that a new item is added to your company's inventory, you want to enter specific customer data about the item, so that the invoices that are printed for some of your customers use the customersâ€™ own item numbers. You want to be alerted when a new item is created. Therefore, you create a rule that triggers an alert when a record is created in the **Released products** form.

1.  Click **Product information management** \> **Common** \> **Released products**.

2.  In the **Released products** form, right-click any item, and then select **Create alert rule**.

3.  In the **Create alert rule** form, follow these steps to create the rule:
    
      - Under **Send email alerts for job status changes**, in the **Field** list, select **All fields**.
    
      - Under **Send email alerts for job status changes**, in the **Event** list, select **Record has been created**.
    
      - Under **Alert me for**, select **All records in %1**. An alert is triggered for any item that is created in the **Released products** form.
    
      - Under **Alert me until**, select **No end date**. Alerts continue to be triggered indefinitely. The rule never becomes inactive.
    
      - Under **Alert me with**, verify or adjust the title of the alert. Optionally, you can write a message that is sent when the alert is triggered.

4.  Click **OK** to activate the rule.

## Example: Record has been deleted

You want to make sure that no customers are deleted in the **Customers** form without your knowledge. Therefore, you create a rule that triggers an alert when a record is deleted in the **Customers** form.

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Customers** \> **All customers**.

2.  Double-click any customer record. In the **Customers** form, right-click any field, and then select **Create alert rule**.

3.  In the **Create alert rule** form, follow these steps to create the rule:
    
      - Under **Send email alerts for job status changes**, in the **Field** list, select **All fields**.
    
      - Under **Send email alerts for job status changes**, in the **Event** list, select **Record has been deleted**.
    
      - Under **Alert me for**, select **All records in %1**. An alert is triggered for any record that is deleted.
    
      - Under **Alert me until**, select **No end date**. Alerts continue to be triggered indefinitely. The rule never becomes inactive.
    
      - Under **Alert me with**, verify or adjust the title of the alert. Optionally, you can write a message that is sent when the alert is triggered.

4.  Click **OK** to activate the rule.
