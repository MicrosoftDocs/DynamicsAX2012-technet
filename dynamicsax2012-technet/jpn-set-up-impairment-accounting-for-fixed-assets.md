## 1\. Set up a posting profile for impairment accounting

4.  In the **Value model** field, select a value model to apply to impairment transactions.

5.  In the **Groupings** field, select the grouping level to set up a main account to post impairment transactions to.
    
    Select from the following options:
    
      - **Table** – Select a main account for each fixed asset.
    
      - **Group** – Select a main account for each fixed asset group.
    
      - **All** – Select a main account for all of the fixed assets.

6.  In the **Fixed asset number** field, select a fixed asset or a fixed asset group for the impairment transactions. The values in this field are determined by the selection in the **Groupings** field.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>This field is available only if you select <STRONG>Table</STRONG> or <STRONG>Group</STRONG> in the <STRONG>Groupings</STRONG> field.</P>



7.  In the **Main account** and **Offset account** fields, select the default main account and the default offset account that are used to post the impairment transactions.

## 2\. Update impairment indicators for a fixed asset

Use the **Update impairment indicators** form to update the impairment indicators, such as undiscounted cash flow for a fixed asset.

To perform this task, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Common** \> **Fixed assets** \> **Fixed assets**. Select or create a fixed asset, and then click **Value models**. In the **Value models** form, select or create a value model record, and then click **Functions** \> **Update impairment indicators**.

4.  In the **Undiscounted cash flow** field, enter the undiscounted cash flow, or in the **Recoverable amount** field, enter the recoverable amount. The **Line number** field is automatically updated with the next line number in the sequence. You can only modify or delete the line that has the highest line number.

You can click **Attachments** in the **Update impairment indicators** form to open the **Fixed asset number** form, where you can attach a document to the impairment indicator. For more information, see [Document handling (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa616432\(v=ax.60\)).

## 3\. Update impairment indicators for multiple fixed assets

2.  Click **New** or press CTRL+N to create an impairment indicator record.

3.  In the **Modify date** field, select the date from which to apply the impairment indicator to the fixed asset.

4.  In the **Fixed asset number** field, select the identification code of the fixed asset number.

5.  In the **Book** field, select the identification code of a value model or a depreciation book. The **Book type** field is updated depending on your selection in the **Book** field.

6.  In the **Undiscounted cash flow** field, enter the undiscounted cash flow, or in the **Recoverable amount** fields, enter the recoverable amount. The **Line number** field is automatically updated with the next line number in the sequence. You can only modify or delete the line that has the highest line number.
