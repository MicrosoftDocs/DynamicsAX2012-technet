You can transfer inventory items between warehouses that are located at different fiscal establishments by using transfer orders. You can transfer inventory items to another fiscal establishment that is in the same state or in another state.

When you transfer the items between different fiscal establishments, the following transfer fiscal documents are issued or received:

  - Outbound fiscal document – Issued when you ship items to a warehouse that is located at a different fiscal establishment.
