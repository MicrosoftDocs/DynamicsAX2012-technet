# Post and print a journal or journal lines 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can post journals and journal lines to the general ledger. You can print journal lines as you prepare them or after they are posted.

## Post in the Journal voucher form

After you create and validate journal lines in one of the **Journal voucher** forms, you can post the vouchers.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>To find the <STRONG>Journal voucher</STRONG> form, open the appropriate journal form, select the appropriate journal, and then click <STRONG>Lines</STRONG>.</P>



1.  Click **Post**.

2.  To post the lines that do not have errors and transfer lines that do have errors to a new journal of the same type, click **Post and transfer**. This new journal is created automatically.
    
    –or–
    
    Click **Post**. If an error exists, no lines are posted, and you receive a message. If the message mentions posting restrictions, you might be set up to post only journals that you create.

If several journals are created and validated, perhaps by several different employees, a manager can inspect the journals and then post the journals in the **Journal** form.

1.  Select the validated journal that you want to post in the **Journal** form.

2.  Click **Post**.

3.  To post the lines that do not have errors and transfer lines that have errors to a new journal of the same type, click **Post and transfer**. This new journal is created automatically.
    
    –or–
    
    Click **Post**. If an error exists, no lines are posted, and you receive a message. If the message mentions posting restrictions, you might be set up to post only journals that you create. For more information, see [Posting restrictions (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh227598\(v=ax.60\)).
