# (BRA) Assess, pay, declare, and adjust ISS taxes 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to determine the amount of Brazilian service tax or Imposto sobre Serviços (ISS) to be paid to São Paulo for each fiscal establishment, and for each service code and tax rate.

The ISS tax assessment includes ISS tax from issuing fiscal documents (NFS\_e) and incoming acquired services. There are two types of ISS tax payments:

  - Payments that are based on outgoing service fiscal documents.

  - Payments that are based on incoming service fiscal documents when the ISS tax is retained by the vendor.

1.  Click **Fiscal books** \> **Common** \> **Tax assessment** \> **ISS**.

2.  On the **ISS** list page, on the **Action Pane**, click **ISS tax assessment** \> **New**.
