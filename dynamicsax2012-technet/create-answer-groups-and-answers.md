# Create answer groups and answers 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You must create answer groups and answers in order to complete a finished questionnaire. For more information, see [Using answers and questions for questionnaire](using-answers-and-questions-for-questionnaire.md).

See [Using questionnaires](using-questionnaires.md) and [Designing questionnaires](designing-questionnaires.md) for an overview of designing questionnaires.

## Answer groups

Use the **Answer groups** form to control the order in which the answers in an answer group appear on a questionnaire. This can be done two different ways:

  - Click **Answer**, and then enter a sequence number to define the location for each answer in the order.

  - Select the **Randomly** check box to display the answers in a random order. The sequence number of the answers becomes irrelevant.

<!-- end list -->

1.  Click **Home** \> **Common** \> **Questionnaires** \> **Design** \> **Answer groups**.

2.  Create a new line.

3.  Under **Answer group**, enter a unique identifier for the group.

4.  In the **Description** field, enter a brief description of the group.
    
    This usually indicates the type of question that the answers are best suited to.

5.  Enter information in the remaining fields, as needed.

6.  To create or view answers for each group, click **Answer**.

7.  To view questions that currently use the answer group, click **Questions**.

For more information about the **Answer groups** form, see [Answer groups (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa598051\(v=ax.60\)).
