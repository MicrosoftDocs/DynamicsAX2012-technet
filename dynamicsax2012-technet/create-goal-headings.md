# Create goal headings 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Before you can set goals for workers, you must set up one or more goal headings. Use goal headings to categorize goals. For example, if you set yearly goals, the goal heading for a goal might be the year in which the person is to achieve the goal.

## Create a goal heading

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Setup** \> **Performance** \> **Goal headings**.

2.  Enter a unique name for the heading.

3.  Enter a description that will help a user to assign a goal to an appropriate heading.

4.  To enable workers to assign goals to the heading, select the **Active** check box.
