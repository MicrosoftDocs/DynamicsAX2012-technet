# (CZE) Customer advance invoices journal report (CustAdvanceInvoiceJour) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX, a customer can make a payment to your organization in advance of receiving items and services. To track this prepayment, you can create an advance invoice for the customer. When the items and services are delivered, you can apply the prepayment to the amount due from the customer for the sale.

The **Advance invoices journal** report displays customer advance invoice transactions. The transactions are sorted in the order of customer account numbers, and then by invoice date. You can filter the report to display a specific customer account, invoice date, invoice number, and invoice currency, or any combination of these criteria.

## How to filter the data on this report

When you generate this report, the following default parameters are displayed. You can use these parameters to filter the data that will be displayed on the report. For more information, see [Filter the data on a report](filter-the-data-on-a-report.md).
