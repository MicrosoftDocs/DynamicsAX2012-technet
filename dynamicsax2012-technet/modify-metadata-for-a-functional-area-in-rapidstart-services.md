# Modify metadata for a functional area in RapidStart Services 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Beginning October 1, 2015, RapidStart services will no longer be supported. For more information, see the announcement on CustomerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/northamerica/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued or PartnerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/news-events/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued.

In Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services, functional areas are used to aggregate groups of related questions that business experts answer to provide information about an implementation of Microsoft Dynamics ERP. For example, the functional area “Process customer payments” is a default functional area that is provided by Microsoft in RapidStart Services. This functional area contains groups of questions that relate to customer payments, customer payment sales taxes, and credit card payments. The functional area “Manage fixed assets” consists of question groups that address depreciation, acquisition, and fixed assets.

You can modify the metadata for a functional area in RapidStart Services. Functional area metadata includes information such as the name and description of the functional area, the industry, the locale, and the version of the Microsoft Dynamics ERP application to which the functional area is assigned. This metadata was specified when the functional area was created.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You cannot change the metadata values for a published functional area. To change those values, you must first unpublish the functional area. For information about how to unpublish a functional area, see <A href="unpublish-a-functional-area-in-rapidstart-services.md">Unpublish a functional area in RapidStart Services</A>.</P>



1.  In the RapidStart Services header, click **Design**, and then click **Functional area**.

2.  In the **Functional area** list, select the functional area for which you want to modify metadata.

3.  Click the **Functional area** button, and then click **Edit functional area**.

4.  Change the data as required, and then click **OK**.
