# Deprecated: (CHN) Accounting period name 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

In the Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009 SP1 GLSCON release, the Accounting period table provides an **Accounting period name** field. This field is a country-specific feature that is provided for Chinese installations, and the field values are not required to be unique in a fiscal year. In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, the **Accounting period name** field is included in the Accounting table. Therefore, the country-specific modification is not required.
