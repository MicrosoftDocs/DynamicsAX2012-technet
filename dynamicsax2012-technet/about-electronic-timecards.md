# About electronic timecards 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use the electronic timecard to make time and attendance registrations in Enterprise Portal. For example, you can register work hours spent on various projects, create absence registrations, and register breaks taken during the work day.

You can create timecard registrations at any time. The following are examples of when to create timecard registrations:

  - Start registrations on the electronic timecard when you arrive at work. At the end of the work day, you can insert the number of hours spent on each job or task.

  - Create timecard registrations on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. You must then create a line for each task you worked on during each day in the period.

When you have created all the registration lines on your electronic timecard for the period, you must transfer the registrations to the **Calculate** form in Microsoft Dynamics AX. Your supervisor or team leader will use the form to calculate your work time, pay time, overtime, flex time, absence time, and so on.
