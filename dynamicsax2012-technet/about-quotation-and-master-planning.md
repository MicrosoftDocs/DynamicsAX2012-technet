# About quotation and master planning [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Click **Master planning** \> **Setup** \> **Plans** \> **Master plans**. We recommend that you obtain a full Microsoft Dynamics CRM license. If you do not have a CRM license, all quotations are included in the master plan, regardless of the probability that they will be converted to actual orders. Including all quotations in the master plan could lead to an unnecessary increase of inventory if the quotations are not confirmed.

If you have a CRM license, you can include only quotations that have a high probability of being converted to orders. For example, if you enter a probability percentage of 85, all quotations that have a probability of 85 percent and more are included.

You may find it useful to include only quotations that have a high probability of conversion to orders if you want to have items in stock so that you can deliver them at the time that is promised in the quotation.
