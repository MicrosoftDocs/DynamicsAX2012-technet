  - Required receipts are attached to the expense report and the original receipts have been received.

  - Transactions that are eligible for Value Added Tax (VAT) recovery include all of the necessary information.

  - Detailed transaction information is included where appropriate on itemized transactions.

When these requirements are met, you can transfer the expense report.

1.  Click **Travel and expense** \> **Common** \> **Expense reports** \> **All expense reports**.

2.  Double-click the expense report that you want to verify.

3.  On the **Header** tab and the **Lines** tab, verify that all required receipts have been attached to the expense report for regular transactions and for itemized transactions.
