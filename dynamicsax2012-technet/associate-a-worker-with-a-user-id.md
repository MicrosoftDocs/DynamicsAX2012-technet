# Associate a worker with a user ID [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

1.  Click **System administration** \> **Common** \> **Users** \> **User relations**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a new user relation.

3.  In the **Person** field, select the worker that you want to associate with a specific user ID.

4.  In the list, select the user ID.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Associate each user ID with only one worker. If multiple workers share the same user ID, many of the forms in <STRONG>Sales and marketing</STRONG> will not open, because the automatic filtering function in the forms cannot uniquely identify the worker.</P>



5.  Close the form to save your changes.
