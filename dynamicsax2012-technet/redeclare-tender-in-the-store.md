# Redeclare tender in the store 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

Occasionally, you may want to change a tender declaration after you have performed the tender declaration on a register. For example, the original tender declaration may contain an error.

## Redeclare tender

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Journals** \> **Open statements**.

2.  On the **Open statements** list page, open the statement to redeclare.

3.  In the **Statements** form, on the **Lines** FastTab, select the register to change the tender declaration for, and then click **Cash declaration**.

4.  In the **Cash declaration** form, enter the new tender declaration for the statement lines for the appropriate coins and notes. For each combination of a coin or note and a default amount, select the quantity of coins or notes in the **Quantity** field.
    
    The results of the redeclaration appear in the **Total** field.

5.  After the tender is redeclared, click **OK**.

## View transactions

You can view transactions for tender declarations. You can also view banked tender transactions, which are also referred to as bank drop transactions.

  - To move a statement to a payment line or sales line, in the **Statements** form, on the **Lines** FastTab, click **Transactions**.
