# About multisite activation - dimension group changes 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When the multisite functionality is activated, the settings for all dimension groups are updated to ensure that all inventory-related transactions can be associated with a site.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Multisite is activated during the upgrade process from Microsoft Dynamics AX 4.0 to Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, or before the upgrade process from Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009 to Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. Multisite cannot be activated as a separate activity.</P>



The following table summarizes the changes that are made to the settings of the dimension groups during the activation.
