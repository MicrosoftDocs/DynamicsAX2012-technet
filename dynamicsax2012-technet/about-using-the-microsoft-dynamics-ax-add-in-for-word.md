# About using the Microsoft Dynamics AX Add-in for Word 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

If your system administrator has installed the Office Add-ins for Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can use the Office Add-in for Microsoft Word to create Word documents and Word templates that contain data from tables that you select in Microsoft Dynamics AX.

For example, you can create a Word template for a collection letter for customers, and then pull the overdue invoices for a specific customer from an open invoice table into the template. You must create a new instance of the template for each customer.

The information that you insert into a template cannot be refreshed. If you want to send another collection letter to the same customer, and the information for the selected customer has been updated, you must use another instance of the Word template to create a document that contains the updated information.

The data that you can export to a document is limited by the permissions that are associated with your assigned user role. Generally, if you can view and modify specific data in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client, you can add, view, and modify the same data in a Word document or template.
