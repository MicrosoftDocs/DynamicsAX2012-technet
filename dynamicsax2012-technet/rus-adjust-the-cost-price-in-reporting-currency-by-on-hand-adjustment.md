# (RUS) Adjust the cost price in reporting currency by on-hand adjustment 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

After you run the inventory closing process, you can adjust the inventory cost price for the remaining inventory items. The adjustment amount is assigned to all open receipts. You can perform adjustments of on-hand inventory only after the inventory closing process is run. You can view the adjusted amounts in the **Adjustment (cur.)** field in the **Transactions** form. For more information, see [(RUS) Inventory transactions (modified form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj733410\(v=ax.60\)).

1.  Click **Inventory management** \> **Periodic** \> **Close and adjustment in currency**.

2.  Select a line that has a transaction type of **Closing accounts**, and then click **Adjustment** \> **On-hand**.

3.  Click **Select**, and then select the inventory dimensions to copy to adjust on-hand inventory. For more information, see [Select on-hand inventory (class form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa585980\(v=ax.60\)).

4.  Click **OK**. The inventory lines that are selected for adjustment are displayed in the **On-hand** form, together with the specified inventory dimensions.

      - **Charges code** – Specify a charges code for all the adjustments that are selected. The adjustments are posted based on the setup of the charges code. The charges code is saved in the settlement records that are created for the adjustment.
    
      - **Item cost price** − After adjustment, the item cost price is equal to the standard price that is specified in the **Price** field on the **Manage costs** FastTab in the **Released product details** form.
    
      - **Fixed cost price** − Open the **Adjustment to fixed cost price** form, and then in the **Price** field, enter the fixed cost price for the inventory item. After adjustment, the item cost price is adjusted to so that it matches the unit price.

        > <P>The value of the adjustment is displayed in the <STRONG>Edit now</STRONG> field in the <STRONG>On-hand</STRONG> form, based on the selected adjustment method. The adjustment value is the difference between the current cost value and the target cost value. You can modify the adjustment value in the <STRONG>Edit now</STRONG> field.</P>
