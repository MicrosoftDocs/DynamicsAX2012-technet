## 1\. Register vacations and calculate vacation compensations

Use the **Vacations** form to register vacations manually. You can also register vacation details by using posted vacation resolutions from the **Vacation resolution** form. You can enter the vacation time in the timesheet manually, or the timesheet is updated automatically if **Timesheet update - Yes** is selected in the **Vacations** form.

Vacation compensation is calculated based on the average earnings of an employee. When the vacation compensation is calculated, the vacation payment is divided across payment periods. After you add the vacation line to the payroll, it is processed at the start of the vacation payment calculation.

Vacation compensation details about the dismissed employee are updated automatically when you post a dismissal resolution in the **Dismissal resolutions** form. After you modify the vacation details for an employee, you can recalculate their vacation compensation in the **Recent transactions** form.

## Register vacations for an employee

To register vacations for an employee, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Calculation procedures** \> **Vacations** \> **Vacation registration**.

2.  In the **Type of vacation** field, select the code for the type of vacation.

3.  In the **Calculation method code** field, select the average earnings method identification code (ID) for the vacation calculation. If necessary, you can modify this value.

4.  Use the information in the following table to select the type of vacation.

    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Vacation</strong> – The payment amount for the granted vacation is calculated.</p>
    <p>To extend a vacation, create a new line, and then in the <strong>Associated vacation</strong> field, select the starting date of the original vacation.

## 2\. Register business trips and calculate business trip compensation

You can use the **Business trips** form to register a business trip and calculate compensation for the business trip. Depending on the business trip type, the timesheets can be generated in the following ways:

  - **Business trip** – The timesheets are generated in the same manner as vacations and sick lists.

  - **Business trip breaking** – The timesheets are updated if you are using the daily assessment principle and the employee returns to work before the granted business trip is over. If you are using the summary assessment principle, the days or hours that are worked during the business trip break period are subtracted from the total number of days or hours that are planned for business trips of the same type. If vacations or sick lists fall within the break period, their days or hours are added to the timesheet.

Employees’ timesheets are updated with a time code that is specified in the **Time code** field for the selected **Business trip** option in the **Timesheet general settings** form. For more information, see [(RUS) Configure parameters for time management](rus-configure-parameters-for-time-management.md).

Average earnings for a business trip are calculated according to the calculation method that is configured for business trip payments. Business trip payments are calculated and registered as payroll transactions according to the counter setup rules for business trip payments.
