# Set up worker attributes 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can set up many different types of attributes for a worker to assist in the optimal scheduling of the worker. In addition to entering information about a worker’s education, skills, certifications, and project experience, you can also enter information about any additional skills that a worker has, such as public speaking ability or media knowledge.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In AX 2012 R3 and cumulative update 7 or later for AX 2012 R2: Other worker attributes are no longer used as part of a worker’s profile.</P>
> <P>Don’t know what version you’re using? See <A href="find-out-which-version-of-microsoft-dynamics-ax-you-are-using.md">Find out which version of Microsoft Dynamics AX you are using</A>.</P>



## Set up additional worker attributes

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Common** \> **Workers** \> **Workers**. Select a worker. On the **Workers** list page, on the **Action Pane**, on the **Competencies** tab, click **Other worker attributes**.

2.  In the **Other worker attributes** form, click **New**.

3.  In the **Attribute group** field, select the attribute group that contains the attribute to assign to the worker.

4.  In the **Attribute ID** field, select the attribute to assign to the worker.

The additional attribute for the worker is displayed in the **Resource competencies** form and the **Schedule resources** form. It can be used as a search criterion in the **Assign resources** form. Worker attributes can also be viewed or assigned from the **Competencies and development** area in the **Worker** form.
