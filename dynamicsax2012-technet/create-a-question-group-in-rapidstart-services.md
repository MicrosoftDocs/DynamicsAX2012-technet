[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Beginning October 1, 2015, RapidStart services will no longer be supported. For more information, see the announcement on CustomerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/northamerica/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued or PartnerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/news-events/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued.

In Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services, a question group is a group of related questions that business experts answer to provide information that is used to configure one aspect of an implementation of Microsoft Dynamics ERP. Each functional area can be assigned one or more question groups. For example, a functional area that is named “Manage collections” might have question groups that are named “Collections” and “Credit rating.” A “Fixed assets” functional area might have question groups that are named “Depreciation,” “Acquisitions,” and “Fixed assets.”

After you create a question group, you can add questions to it. For information about how to add questions to a question group, see [Create questions and question actions in RapidStart Services](create-questions-and-question-actions-in-rapidstart-services.md).

1.  In the RapidStart Services header, click **Design**, and then click **Functional area**.

2.  Click the **Question group** button, and then click **New question group**.

3.  In the **Question group** form, in the **Question group name** field, enter a name to identify this question group.

4.  In the **Functional area** list, select the functional area to which to assign the question group.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Only functional areas that are not currently published are available. If you want to add a question group to a functional area that has been published, you must first unpublish the functional area. For information about how to unpublish a functional area, see <A href="unpublish-a-functional-area-in-rapidstart-services.md">Unpublish a functional area in RapidStart Services</A>.</P>



5.  Optional: In the **Description** field, describe the purpose of the question group and how it will be used.

6.  Click **OK**.

7.  On the **Release version** tab, select the check box for each version of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 that this question group can be used to configure.

8.  On the **Industry** tab, select the industries to which this question group applies.

9.  On the **Country/region** tab, select the countries/regions to which this question group applies.
