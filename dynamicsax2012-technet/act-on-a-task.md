# Act on a task 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A task is a unit of work that is associated with a specific business document. For example, the workflow for a purchase requisition may have a task that requires you to:

  - Add a vendor to each line item on the purchase requisition.

  - Call the vendors that are listed on the purchase requisition.

Follow these steps to act on a task that is assigned to you.

1.  Open the document that the task is associated with.

2.  Review the message bar for information about the workflow process. To view detailed instructions, click the icon in the message bar. The following figure shows the location of the message bar and the icon that you click to view instructions.

3.  A task can be assigned to multiple people, however, only one person can complete the task. If this task is assigned to multiple people, but you want to complete it, click **Actions** \> **Accept**. This indicates that you will complete the task.

4.  Click **Actions** and then click one of the options listed in the following table. The options that you see may vary, depending on how the task was configured.
