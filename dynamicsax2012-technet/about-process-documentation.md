When you click **Process documentation** on the Quick Launch, the contents of the **Process documentation** folder are displayed. You can use this folder to store and share business process documents and evidence.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This is a SharePoint library. Therefore, you can control access to this document library. For more information, see the Microsoft&nbsp;SharePoint documentation.</P>



## Create and share business process documentation

To help you create documentation for processes that involve working with Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can use the Task recorder. For more information, search for "task recorder" in the Microsoft Dynamics AX Help.

1.  In the Microsoft Dynamics AX client, use the **Task recorder** form to record tasks.

2.  Based on the recorded tasks, generate documents that include step-by-step instructions and illustrations.

3.  Revise the documents, if you have to, to include additional information about your organization's policies, and additional steps that are performed outside Microsoft Dynamics AX.

4.  In Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX, click **Compliance** on the top link bar, and then click **Process documentation** on the Quick Launch. The contents of the **Process documentation** folder are displayed.

5.  Click **Add document**.

6.  Select the file or files to upload and then click **OK**.

## Upload evidence

In the context of compliance, evidence provides proof that a control exists and is working correctly. For more information, see [About evidence](about-evidence.md).
