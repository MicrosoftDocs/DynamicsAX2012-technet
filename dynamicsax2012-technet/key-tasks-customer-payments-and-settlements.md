Use this procedure if you want to enter payment and settlement information in the same form, **Enter customer payments**. For example, you might do this if your customer sends a check for the amount of an invoice.

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Journals** \> **Payments** \> **Payment journal**.

4.  In the **Enter customer payment information** field group, enter information about the payment.

5.  If the **Mark by priority** button is available, you can click this button to mark all debit transactions for settlement. The transactions are marked according to the settlement priority that is specified in the **Accounts receivable parameters** form. For more information about this button, see [Enter customer payments (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh209561\(v=ax.60\)).

6.  If the **Mark invoice lines** button is available when you select an invoice, you can click this button to open the **Mark invoice lines** form. Use this form to mark individual transaction lines for settlement and modify the amounts to settle for those lines.

## Enter and settle a payment for multiple invoices in a payment journal

Use this procedure if you know which customer account the payment is for, or if the payment is intended to settle multiple invoices.

5.  In the **Settle open transactions** form, select the **Mark** check box on the line for the customer invoice that corresponds to the received payment.
    
    If the customer has sent a payment that applies to several invoices, select the **Mark** check box on each relevant invoice line.

6.  To see whether the payment causes a discount for the customer for a specific invoice, select the invoice line, and then click the **Cash discount** tab. If a discount applies, it will be automatically subtracted from the original invoice amount when the payment line is created in step 9.

7.  If the **Mark by priority** button is available, you can click this button to mark all debit transactions for settlement, according to the settlement priority that is specified in the **Accounts receivable parameters** form. For more information about this button, see [Settle open transactions - customer (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa558602\(v=ax.60\))

## Mark invoice lines for settlement

When you process a customer payment using the **Enter customer payments**, payment **Journal voucher**, or **Settle open transactions** forms, you might have to mark specific invoice lines for settlement and modify the amounts to settle for those lines.

Use this procedure to mark and modify invoice lines for settlement using the **Mark invoice lines** form. To open this form, click **Mark invoice lines** in the settlement forms. The button is available if all of the following circumstances apply:

  - The **Mark lines on free text invoices and interest notes** check box is selected in the **Accounts receivable parameters** form.

  - The total amount of the selected customer transaction must be greater than zero; it is not a credit memo or a credit interest note.

  - The selected transaction contains more than one transaction that is available to be marked.
