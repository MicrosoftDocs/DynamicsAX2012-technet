# How to: Prevent Display of Print Setup for Reports (MorphX Reporting Tools) 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A report can contain sensitive data that requires that it be printed to only a secure printer.

## Preventing Users from Changing the Destination Printer

If a report contains sensitive data, you can prevent users who run the report from changing the destination printer.

### To prevent users from changing the printer

  - Set the Interactive property for the report to **No**.
    
    –or–

  - Override the ReportRun.prompt method on the report and set the value of the \_enableDevice parameter to false.

## Example

    public boolean prompt(boolean _enableCopy = true,
                          boolean _enablePages = true,
                          boolean _enableDevice = true,
                          boolean _enableProperties = true,
                          boolean _enablePrintTo = true)
    {
        boolean ret;
        ;
        ret = super(_enableCopy,
                    _enablePages,
                    false,   // _enableDevice
                    _enableProperties,
                    _enablePrintTo);
        return ret;
    }
