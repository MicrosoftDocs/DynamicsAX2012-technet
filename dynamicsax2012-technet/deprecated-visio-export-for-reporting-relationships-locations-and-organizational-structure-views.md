<td><p>Reason for deprecation</p></td>
<td><p>Architectural changes and a new control were added to all three views. The new control enables more nodes to be displayed in the hierarchical structure. You can also create and modify nodes directly from the new control. The architectural changes would have required extensive changes to the Visio Export feature.</p></td>
