# Deprecated: Visio Export for reporting relationships, locations, and organizational structure views 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, you can export the reporting relationships view, locations view, and organizational structure view to Visio.

## Overview

<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Reason for deprecation</p></td>
<td><p>Architectural changes and a new control were added to all three views. The new control enables more nodes to be displayed in the hierarchical structure. You can also create and modify nodes directly from the new control. The architectural changes would have required extensive changes to the Visio Export feature.</p></td>
