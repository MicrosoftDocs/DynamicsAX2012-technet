# About shopping for items 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use Enterprise Portal to shop for and order items online.

You can view the available items using the **Product catalog** and **Campaign items** pages, and then add any items to your shopping cart. For more information, see [View catalog and campaign items](view-catalog-and-campaign-items.md).

You can use the **Shopping cart** page to view the item order lines that are added to the shopping cart but which are not ordered yet. If you know the product numbers, you can use this page to create order lines for the items that are listed on the **Product catalog** and **Campaign items** pages. Then you can add the lines directly to the cart. Finally, you can update item quantities and remove items from your shopping cart. For more information, see [View the shopping cart](view-the-shopping-cart.md) and [Add items to the shopping cart](add-items-to-the-shopping-cart.md).

To place your order, click the **Checkout** button on the **Shopping cart** page to confirm or edit your delivery address, and place the order. When the order has been confirmed, a sales order is created, and the order number is displayed for your reference. If you do not place an order for the items in your cart, you can view them at any time using the **Shopping cart** page. For more information, see [Place your order](place-your-order.md).
