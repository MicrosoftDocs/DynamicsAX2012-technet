# Configure partition accounts 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Workflow execution accounts are configured separately for each partition. Use the **System service accounts** form to configure the Workflow execution account for a partition.

## Configure the Workflow execution account

The Workflow execution account is used to run application business logic and access Microsoft Dynamics AX data. You can use one of the following accounts:

  - Enter a domain account in the **Alias** and **Network domain** fields to use a domain user for the Workflow execution account.

  - Enter a new or existing Microsoft Dynamics AX user to access the database.

For more information about the requirements for this account, see [Specify the workflow execution account](specify-the-workflow-execution-account.md).
