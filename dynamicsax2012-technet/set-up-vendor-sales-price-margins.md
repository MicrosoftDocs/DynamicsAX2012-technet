# Set up vendor sales price margins 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

The vendor sales price margin contains a formula that converts the vendor's suggested retail price or the vendor's purchase price for a product to a sales price in local currency. The sales price margin is used only if there is no entry for the product in the vendor's sales price points.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If no suggested retail price is imported for a retail vendor's product, the sales price can be calculated based on the purchase price. Retail uses the <STRONG>Vendor sales price margin setup</STRONG> form to calculate the sales price.</P>



1.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Product/order creation** \> **Vendor sales price margin setup**.

2.  In the **Vendor sales price margin setup** form, select the vendor to set up a sales price margin for.

3.  If the vendor suggested that a specific factor be used to calculate the sales price of a product, enter the suggested factor in the **Suggested contribution ratio** field. Otherwise, enter a factor in the **Contribution ratio** field.
