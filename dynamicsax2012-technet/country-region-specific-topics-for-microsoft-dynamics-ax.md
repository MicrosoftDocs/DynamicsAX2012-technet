# Country/region-specific topics for Microsoft Dynamics AX 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Microsoft Dynamics AX provides local and global functionality to meet requirements for many countries/regions around the world. For Help topics that support that functionality, titles begin with the three-letter International Organization for Standardization (ISO) abbreviation for that country. For example, topics that support functionality that is specific to Brazil have titles that begin with the prefix (BRA).

Help topics that support country/region-specific features delivered with Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 are grouped by country/region and are located in the [Additional country/region-specific information](additional-country-region-specific-information.md) folder. Expand this folder to find sub-folders containing topics that support functionality specific to Brazil, China, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, India, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Russia.

Microsoft Dynamics AX is updated as country/region-specific requirements change. For information about country/region-specific functionality that is periodically added to Microsoft Dynamics AX, together with other updated country/region information, look for updated Microsoft Dynamics AX documentation on [TechNet](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=214391) and in the [Microsoft Dynamics Localization Portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=268638).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Country/region-specific features are available based on the country/region that is associated with the primary address of the legal entity. For example, if the primary address of the legal entity (in the <A href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh242860(v=ax.60)">Legal entities (form)</A>) is in Spain, users have access to features specific to Spain.</P>
