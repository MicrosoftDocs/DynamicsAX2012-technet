3.  On the **Overview** tab, select the item number, the quantity, and the offset account.

4.  Click the **Tax information** tab.

5.  View or modify the excise registration number that is attached to the company in the **ECC number** field.

6.  View or modify the excise tariff code that is attached to the item in the **Excise tariff code** field.

7.  Select the excise register that must be updated with the quantity in the **Excise record type** field.
    
      - **RG23A** - RG register for non capital purchases.
    
      - **RG23C** - RG register for capital purchases.

8.  Select the **DSA** check box to update the DSA register with the quantity details. The **DSA** check box is activated for the following two conditions:
    
      - When you select an item that has a **Bill of Material (BOM)** item type in the journal line.
    
      - When you select the **None** option in the **Excise record type** field.

9.  Validate and post the journal. The Part I register of the RG23A, the RG23C, or the RG23D register is updated with the transaction details of the quantity.
    
    For example, a line in the movement journal is created for an item with the following details:
    
      - Cost price – INR 100.00
    
      - Quantity – 10
    
      - Amount – INR 1,000.00
    
      - Excise record type – RG23A
    
    When the movement journal is posted, the RG23A Part I register is updated with the inward quantity 10.00.
