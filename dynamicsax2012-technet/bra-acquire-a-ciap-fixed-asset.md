# (BRA) Acquire a CIAP fixed asset 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

When a legal entity purchases a fixed asset, the ICMS tax on the transaction, which is included in the fixed asset price, can be refunded in 48 installments. The legal entity must present a specific fiscal book or report the information within the SPED fiscal file to the government. Create a Controle de Crédito de ICMS do Ativo Permanente (CIAP) fixed asset to track these installments.

To generate fixed asset tax credit, the legal entity must retain acquisition information for the fixed asset and the incoming invoices for a time period. This information is used for the fixed asset tax credit assessment in a future booking period.
