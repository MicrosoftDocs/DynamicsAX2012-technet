# (POL) Set up credit note parameters 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

In Poland, you must print credit notes in a specified format. A credit note must contain a reference to the original invoice, all corrected and corrective lines, and the reason that the correction was made. A corrected line is the original invoice line with a negative sign, and cannot be modified. A corrective line is the original invoice line with a positive sign, which can be modified.

A corrective invoice with a positive amount is treated as a credit note.
