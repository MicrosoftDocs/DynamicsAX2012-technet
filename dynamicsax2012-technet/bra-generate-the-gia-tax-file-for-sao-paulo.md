# (BRA) Generate the GIA tax file for São Paulo 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to generate a Guia de Informação e Apuração (GIA) tax file for São Paulo by using the **Booking period** list page. The GIA text file provides information about all fiscal documents that have been received and issued each month for fiscal establishments that are located in São Paulo. This information is used by tax authorities. The GIA text file also includes information about tax amounts.

## Generate the GIA text file for São Paulo

To generate the GIA text file for São Paulo, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Fiscal books** \> **Common** \> **Booking period**. On the **Action Pane**, click the **Tax statements** tab.

2.  Select a booking period, and then click **GIA**.

3.  Specify the location and name of the file. The default location is specified in the **GIA setup parameters** form, and the default file name is automatically generated. In most cases, you should accept the default entry.

4.  Select either **Normal** or **Substitute** for the file type.

5.  Select either **RPA** or **RPA-Exempt** for the tributary regime.

6.  Select the version. The default entry is specified in the **GIA setup parameters** form.

7.  Optional: Click the **Batch** tab and specify options for batch processing. You might use batch processing if the file should be generated later or on a server instead of on your computer.

8.  Click **OK**.
