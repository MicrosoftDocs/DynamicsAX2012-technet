# (USA) Comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Microsoft Dynamics AX provides tools to manage information that can help you comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

  - You can enter requirements for physical activity, visual acuity, and working conditions that are related to positions.

  - You can request and grant special accommodations that a person needs in order to perform tasks that are required by positions.

The U.S. government offers financial incentives, such as tax credits and deductions, to companies that provide special accommodations to workers who have disabilities or hire individuals who have disabilities and were referred by qualified governmental agencies.

To help you track information about the accommodations that you extend, reporting features make the processes of collecting, maintaining, and retrieving this information from the system easier.

## Recording physical requirements for position groups and positions

You can enter physical requirements that are related to position groups and positions, such as:

  - The level of physical activity that is required.

  - Specific physical requirements.

  - Requirements for visual acuity. This includes color, depth perception, and field of vision.

  - One or more work conditions that a worker will be subjected to. You can select one or more conditions in several categories.

If you enter information about a position group, you can then copy the information to positions that are assigned to the position group. This saves time when you set up new positions.

To print a checklist that contains the physical requirements information, select the position, click **ADA**, and then click **Print requirements**.

To reset all physical retirements to their default settings, select the position, and then click **ADA** \> **Setup requirements**. In the **ADA requirements** form, click **Reset requirement**.

## About work environment accommodations

Accommodations represent changes to work environments or business operations that achieve equal employment opportunity for a person who has a disability. You can enter requests for special work environment accommodations that are made by employees and applicants with regard to one or more specific tasks that are required by a position. You can then evaluate whether the accommodation is reasonable or if it will impose unnecessary cost, and then either grant or deny the accommodation request.

If you hire an applicant for whom you granted an accommodation, the person keeps the accommodation information after he or she is hired.

Before you can start working with accommodations, you must first create one or more accommodation types. This lets you sort accommodations by type to find a particular accommodation quickly.
