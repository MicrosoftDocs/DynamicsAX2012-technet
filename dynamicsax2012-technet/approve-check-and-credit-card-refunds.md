# Approve check and credit card refunds 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic describes how to approve and process refunds for call center customers.

In the **Call center parameters** form, you can set thresholds above which refunds that are issued via check and credit card must be manually approved. For more information, see [Configuring parameters and initial settings (Call center)](configuring-parameters-and-initial-settings-call-center.md). Any refund that exceeds the threshold amount is added to the approval queue. After you approve the refund, the return sales order can be invoiced.

## Prerequisites

The following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you start.
