# Create production groups 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Creating production groups is helpful when you create production orders. Production groups establish a relation between production orders and the ledger accounts. Attach each production group to a default posting profile. The default posting profile determines how the transactions for the production orders in the group are posted to the ledger.

1.  Click **Production control** \> **Setup** \> **Production** \> **Production groups**.

2.  On the **Overview** tab, in the **Production group** field, enter an identifier for the production group.

3.  In the **Name** field, enter the name of the production group.

4.  Click the **Ledger - items** tab. In the **Items in process** and **Costing** field groups, select the ledger accounts to use for posting material consumption.

5.  Click the **Ledger - resources** tab. In the **Work in process** and **Costing** field groups, select the ledger accounts to use for posting material consumption.
