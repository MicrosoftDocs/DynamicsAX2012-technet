# Set up advanced ledger entries (Public sector) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

If your organization is in the public sector, you can use advanced ledger entries to create, adjust, and reverse ledger entries. For example, you could use advanced ledger entries to reclassify expenditures if invoices had been mistakenly posted to the wrong account or project.

When you use advanced ledger entries, you must use General ledger posting definitions. Posting definitions can be set up to reclassify expenditures from one fund to another. On the **Advanced ledger entry** form, you can identify project information, use workflow approvals, perform budget checks, and preview the ledger entries before they are posted to the ledger.

## Set up advanced ledger entries

2.  Required: In the **Number sequences** area of the **General ledger parameters** form, set up the **Advanced ledger entry** and **Advanced ledger entry voucher** number sequences. For more information, see [Number sequence overview](number-sequence-overview.md).

3.  Required: Set up posting definitions for the General ledger module on the **Posting definitions** form. For more information, see [About posting definitions](about-posting-definitions.md) and [Set up posting definitions](set-up-posting-definitions.md).
