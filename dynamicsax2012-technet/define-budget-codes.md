# Define budget codes 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use the **Budget codes** form to set up budget codes for budget register entries. You can use budget codes to categorize budget types. For more information, see [Budget codes (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh209638\(v=ax.60\)).

1.  Click **Budgeting** \> **Setup** \> **Basic budgeting** \> **Budget codes**.

2.  Click **New** and enter a code and a description, such as ExpenseTransfer and Expense to Expense.

3.  Select a budget type, such as **Transfer**.

4.  If this code should be the default code when documents of the selected budget type are automatically created, select the **Set as default code** check box.

5.  Optional: Select a reason code.

6.  Optional: Select a workflow. If a workflow is selected, every budget register entry that uses this code is submitted to workflow. For more information, see [Set up Budgeting workflows](set-up-budgeting-workflows.md).
