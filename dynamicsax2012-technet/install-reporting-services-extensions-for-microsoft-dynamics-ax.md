Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services is the primary reporting platform for Microsoft Dynamics AX. The reports that are included with Microsoft Dynamics AX run on the Reporting Services platform.

To integrate Microsoft Dynamics AX and Reporting Services, you must complete several procedures. You must first install the Reporting Services extensions by running the Microsoft Dynamics AX Setup Wizard and selecting the **Reporting Services extensions** option. This option installs the extensions and enables you to deploy the reports that are included with Microsoft Dynamics AX.
