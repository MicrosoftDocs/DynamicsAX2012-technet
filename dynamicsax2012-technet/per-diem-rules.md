# Per diem rules [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A per diem is an allowance that is paid to a worker who is traveling for work. In **Travel and expense**, you can create per diem rules for different traveling situations. Per diem rates can be based on the time of year, the travel location, or both. When you create a per diem rule, you can specify that a percentage of the per diem rate will be withheld if a worker receives complimentary meals or services. You can also set a minimum and maximum number of hours that the per diem rate can apply to a worker's travel.

The calculation of a total per diem amount is based on the start dates and end dates that you can set in the **Per diems** form.
