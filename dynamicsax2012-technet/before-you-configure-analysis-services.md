Before you configure Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services for use with Microsoft Dynamics AX, you must complete the following procedures.

## Verify that you have the required permissions to configure Analysis Services

To configure Analysis Services, you must have the required permissions. For more information, see [Verify that you have the required permissions for installation](verify-that-you-have-the-required-permissions-for-installation.md).

## Create a domain account to run the Analysis Services service

Create a domain account that can run the Analysis Services service. For more information, see [Create service accounts](create-service-accounts.md).

The proxy account for Business Connector must be assigned to the server administrator role in Analysis Services. To complete that task, follow these steps.

1.  Open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and connect to your Analysis Services instance.

2.  In the tree view, right-click the Analysis Services instance, and then click **Properties**. The **Analysis Services Properties** window is displayed.

5.  Enter the Business Connector proxy account in the following format: \[DomainName\]\\\[UserName\]. Click **OK**.

## Install prerequisites

On the computer where Analysis Services is installed, or where you plan to install Analysis Services, run the prerequisite validation utility to verify that system requirements have been met. For information about how to run the prerequisite validation utility, see [Check prerequisites](check-prerequisites.md).
