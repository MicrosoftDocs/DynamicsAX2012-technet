You can view inventory adjustments or settlements that are split by miscellaneous charge codes. You can view the receipt cost, all types of miscellaneous charges that are adjusted to the purchase invoice, and cost adjustments in inventory transactions separately. When you select the **Misc. charges structure** check box, all the cost adjustments or settlements that are made for an item are split by the miscellaneous charge codes and saved during inventory closing.

Use this procedure to activate the miscellaneous charges structure for inventory settlements by using the **Inventory and warehouse management parameters** form.

1.  Click **Inventory management** \> **Setup** \> **Inventory and warehouse management parameters**.

2.  On the **General** link, select the **Misc. charges structure** check box to enable inventory settlements to be split by miscellaneous charge codes.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can also view the structure of the accrued charges that are added to the item cost by using the <STRONG>Cost explorer</STRONG> form.</P>
