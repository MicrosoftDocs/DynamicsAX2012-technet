# (RUS) Create and post a storno transfer journal 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can post transfer journals according to the storno option that is used for other inventory journal types. You can mark a journal and its lines with the storno option. Inventory transactions that are created for the lines are also marked as storno, which differentiates the lines on inventory reports. The general ledger transactions for the storno journal are also posted as storno. To simplify the process of creating the storno transfer journal, the extended Copy inventory journal function is available for transfer journals.

You can use storno to reverse a journal transaction that is posted incorrectly.

1.  Click **Inventory management** \> **Journals** \> **Item transactions** \> **Transfer**.

2.  Create a new line, select the name of the journal to correct, and then click the **General** tab. For more information about inventory journals, see [Inventory journal (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa558607\(v=ax.60\)).

3.  Select the **Storno** check box to reverse the journal transaction.

4.  Click **Lines** to open the **Journal lines, inventory** form.

5.  Create a new journal line, and enter the required details. For more information about inventory journals, see [Journal lines, Inventory transfer (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa587291\(v=ax.60\)).
