# About WIP invoice on-account accounts 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can create an on-account invoice for work in process (WIP) on a project. The amount that you select for the WIP invoice can be related to specific costs or to a specified percentage of the total contract amount. You can select an estimated amount on the invoice, and then reverse the estimate when you calculate the actual invoice amount earned on a project. For more information about how to create an on-account invoice, see [Create on-account invoices for all projects](create-on-account-invoices-for-all-projects.md).

## Postings for an on-account invoice

Before you can create a WIP on-account invoice, you must select ledger accounts in the **Project groups** form to use for posting the invoice. The postings by project transaction type for an on-account invoice are shown in the following table.
