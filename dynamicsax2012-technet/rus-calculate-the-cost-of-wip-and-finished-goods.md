Use the **End** form to calculate the cost of work in progress (WIP) and finished goods. The calculation of the production order cost is distributed between WIP, finished goods, defective products, and by-products. For more information, see [(RUS) Calculating costs for WIP and finished goods](rus-calculating-costs-for-wip-and-finished-goods.md).

1.  Click **Production control** \> **Periodic** \> **Production orders** \> **End**.

2.  Create a line for a production.

3.  In the **Production** field, select a production order.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If you select the <STRONG>End job</STRONG> check box, you cannot recalculate the production order cost. The cost of the production order is calculated only at the end of the production cycle.</P>



4.  Click **OK** to calculate the production order cost and close the form. The cost of the production order is calculated, and the calculation is distributed between WIP, finished goods, defective products, and by-products.
