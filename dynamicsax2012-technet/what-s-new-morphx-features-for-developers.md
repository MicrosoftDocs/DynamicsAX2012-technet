## Models and the Model Store

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>In earlier versions, application model data for Microsoft Dynamics AX was stored in a proprietary database that was named the Application Object Database (AOD). Each layer of the application had a corresponding .aod file. AX 2012 introduces the model store, which is based on Microsoft SQL Server. Use the model store to work with business data or customer data.</p></td>
<td><p>The model store did not exist. Application model data was stored in .aod files. You can load .aod files during version upgrade. You can also load .aod files by using the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</p></td>
<td><p>The following model features are new:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A model is a set of model elements in a specific layer.</p></li>
<li><p>Each layer consists of one or more models. One of the models is generated by the system. For example, VAR Model is the model that is generated for the VAR layer.</p></li>
<li><p>Each element in a layer must belong to only one model.</p></li>
<li><p>Models can be exported to a file artifact that is known as a model file. Model files have an .axmodel extension. A model file is like an .aod file from earlier versions, but the names and numbers are not limited. Models in the model store can be exported to model files and imported from model files. Model files can be signed, and the signature is verified when the model files are installed.</p></li>
<li><p>Model files replace .aod files as installation artifacts.</p></li>
<li><p>Models in the model store replace .aod files that were used at run time.</p></li>
<li><p>Development is performed in the current model in a given layer. All development work, such as creating a new class, becomes part of the current model in the current layer. You can change the current model by clicking the name of the current model on the status bar. (This method resembles the method that is used to change the current company.)</p></li>
<li><p>Any element that is created in the current layer can easily be moved to another model in the same layer.</p></li>
<li><p>The Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Object Tree (AOT) shows the model that a particular element belongs to and also the layer tags.</p></li>
<li><p>The additional folder capabilities for version control have been renamed models, and the capabilities have been extended. When you add an element to version control, the element is added to the version-controlled model.</p></li>
<li><p>You can generate a MorphX project that contains all the application objects in the model. A new <strong>Model management</strong> submenu on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu contains many tools that you can use to work with models and the model store.</p></li>
<li><p>The new SysModel* system tables provide a view of the metadata that is associated with models. These tables let you use model metadata in select statements in your X++ code. For example, you can use the SysModelElementLabel table to retrieve the string value for the label that is associated with a particular model element.</p></li>

Therefore, you no longer have to worry that you might run out of object IDs.</p></td>

<td><p>AxUtil is a command-line utility that you can use to import and export .axmodel files into the model store. You can also use AxUtil to delete one or more models, create new empty models, and list all the models in a layer.</p>
<p>All the capabilities of AxUtil are also exposed as Windows PowerShell cmdlets.</p></td>
<td><p>Users can use these tools to work with models from outside the development environment. Therefore, there are more options for scripting deployment processes.</p></td>

<td><p>In AX 2012, the development experience is separated from the application experience as a new workspace. You now use the development environment when you write code in Microsoft Dynamics AX.</p></td>
<td><p>Development occurred directly in the Application Workspace.</p></td>
<td><p>The Developer Workspace contains all the tools and features that a developer requires to create and customize a Microsoft Dynamics AX application. Changes that you save in the Development Workspace are always synchronized with the Application Workspace. You can still open application elements in the AOT. You can also open an Application Workspace from the Development Workspace to view your customizations.</p>
<p>You can open Microsoft Dynamics AX directly from a Development Workspace by using the Ax32.exe command-line flag /development.</p></td>
<td><p>The new Development Workspace provides a more streamlined environment for writing code. The menus have also been customized, so that you can more easily find the tools and commands that you use when you write code.</p></td>

## Installation-Specific IDs

<th><p>Why is this important?</p></th>
<th><p>Where can I find more information?</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Object IDs, such as table IDs, field IDs, and class IDs, are now installation specific. Therefore, you no longer have to worry about conflicting object IDs in different installations.</p></td>
<td><p>Objects IDs were assigned when a model element was created.</p></td>
<td><p>When a new model element is saved, imported, or installed, a unique ID is assigned to the model element at that installation site.</p>
<p>For example, when a new class is added by a developer and saved to the model store, the class is assigned a class ID. However, when the same class is imported into another installation at a customer site, the class ID might differ from the ID that was assigned in the first installation site.</p>
<p>The new object IDs that are assigned for AX 2012 installations have a larger range than the previous object IDs and will not conflict with any of the earlier versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX.</p>
<p>In an upgrade scenario, object IDs are preserved, because they are automatically assigned to the new <strong>LegacyId</strong> property on the application objects.</p></td>
<td><p>Because IDs are installation specific, an ID is not assigned until installation time. Therefore, conflicts are avoided.</p>
<p>Because the assignment of object IDs is handled at the installation site, Team Server no longer has to manage IDs. Team Server is no longer installed, and the setup of version control no longer depends on Team Server.</p></td>

<ul>
<li><p>The method list displays all methods in the class. You can scroll through the list by using the mouse, and the list is automatically resized.</p></li>
<li><p>Basic editing functionality has been improved. For example, you can comment or uncomment code, move code by using a drag-and-drop operation, swap characters, delete a whole line, and change text in many other basic ways.</p></li>
<li><p>Code navigation is more like code navigation in Visual Studio. For example, you can use the Home key, navigate line ends, and go to the next or previous word as you do in Visual Studio.</p></li>
<li><p>It is easier to select code by using the margin or by using block selection, and word selection is improved.</p></li>
<li><p>Code rendering is improved. For example, the value of a label is displayed when you rest the mouse pointer on the label, and an indicator in the margin tracks your changes. Additionally, line numbers are displayed, the font is improved, there is more syntax coloring, and you can view whitespace.</p></li>
<li><p>You can search for code incrementally. Search uses .NET regular expressions.</p></li>
<li><p>IntelliSense has been improved. IntelliSense now includes word completion, tooltips that display the XML documentation comments for a method or class, and help for multiline parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>Errors in code are underlined by using a wavy line. When you rest the mouse pointer on the wavy line, the error message for the compiler is displayed. Code breakpoints can be toggled in the margin.</p></li>
