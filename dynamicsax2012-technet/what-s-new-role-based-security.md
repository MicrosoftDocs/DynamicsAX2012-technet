# What's new: Role-based security 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In earlier versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX, the management of application security was complex and time-consuming. Administrators had to determine which tables and fields were required for a task, and then grant a user permissions for those tables and fields. In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, security management is more intuitive and less time-consuming. Administrators manage security by defining roles and then assigning users to those roles. Developers assign permissions to program artifacts such as tables, forms, and form controls. Permissions are grouped into privileges and duties that are assigned to roles.

## New functionality

The system administrator and the developer each manage parts of the new security system. The administrator defines the roles that are used in the organization and assigns users to those roles. The developer defines the duties that are used to grant permission to the tasks that each role performs.

To grant a user group permission to perform a particular operation, the administrator had to identify the application objects, such as tables, fields, and menu items, that were required for the operation.

<td><p>Many security roles are predefined to make security setup easier. The administrator grants access to the duties that users in a role perform.</p>
<p>The administrator no longer has to identify the application objects that are required for an operation. Instead, the developer now associates the necessary permissions in the Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Object Tree (AOT) on each relevant item.</p>
<p>Because rules can be set up for automatic role assignment, the administrator does not have to be involved every time that a user's responsibilities change. After security roles and rules have been set up, role assignments can be updated based on changes in business data.</p>

## What’s new in security for developers

## What’s new in AX 2012

Many elements in the AOT have properties that are related to role-based security. However, for the developer, the central location of role-based security is under the **Security** node.

Role-based security has mechanisms that help secure both columns and rows in tables. You can help secure the following elements:

  - Tables and table fields – You can often help secure these elements by limiting access through menu items and forms that interact with the tables.

  - Table records – You can help secure these elements based on the data values in the records.

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Create security permissions on individual AOT elements.</p></td>
<td><p>The feature was not supported.</p></td>
<td><p>The system automatically generates sets of permission specifications on forms and other AOT elements. The permission specifications are inferred by the system to match the details of each form. The developer can modify the permission specifications on any given form.</p>
<p>The developer selects the set of permission specifications that applies to each menu item that refers to the form. The developer uses the AOT to activate the selected permission specifications. The developer can combine many active permissions into one privilege. Active permissions are created in the AOT, under the <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Permissions</strong> node. One privilege can correspond to the various actions that are required to perform one particular business task.</p>
<p>Either the system administrator or the developer can assign a privilege to a user role. All users who are assigned to the role gain that privilege.</p></td>
<td><p>The new security system takes less work to maintain as your business evolves. Security constructs can be reused more easily.</p>
<p>Data that the user does not have permissions to see is never sent from Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Object Server (AOS) to the client. Appropriate security does not rely on forms for enforcement.</p></td>

<td><p>The <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa879172(v=ax.60)">record level security (RLS)</a> feature was used to filter access to table records. RLS security constructs applied only in individual tables.</p>
<p>RLS was applied only if the developer explicitly called RLS to enforce security. Therefore, security enforcement could be accidentally omitted.</p></td>
<td><p>Security policies for table rows behave like a where clause in SQL. A security policy is based on a query under the <strong>Queries</strong> node in the AOT. The details of the policy are specified under the <strong>Data Sources</strong> &gt; <strong>Ranges</strong> node. Therefore, foreign key relations between tables can be part of a security policy.</p>
<p>Security policies are assigned to user roles.</p></td>
<td><p>Security policies can restrict access to table rows, based on foreign key relationships between tables. One security policy can replace several RLS specifications.</p>
<p>After a security policy is created in the AOT and assigned to a user role, the system automatically enforces the policy. Therefore, developers do not have to add calls to a security system in their code.</p>
<p>The RLS feature will be removed from a future version of the product.</p></td>

## Special considerations

If you are using an earlier version of Microsoft Dynamics AX, your existing security setup cannot be directly upgraded to role-based security. You must evaluate your current user groups and determine the best way to implement them in AX 2012. For more information, see [Best practices for upgrading to role-based security](best-practices-for-upgrading-to-role-based-security.md).

To effectively use role-based security, you must plan and set up the roles that are required for your business. Work with the managers who oversee the different groups in the business to determine the appropriate permission levels for roles. For example, work with a manager in the Finance department to determine permission levels for Finance roles.
