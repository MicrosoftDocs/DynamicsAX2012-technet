# Create a one-time vendor and invoice (Public sector) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

You might have a situation where you have to create an invoice for a new vendor with whom you have no regular relationship. When approval or a contract in the form of a purchase order is not required, you can quickly create an invoice at the same time as creating a record for the vendor. For example, you might have to pay referees or refunds, where a master vendor record does not exist.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This feature is available only if Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 Cumulative Update 8 is installed, and if the <STRONG>Public Sector</STRONG> configuration key is selected.</P>



## Create a single one-time vendor and invoice

Use this procedure to quickly create an invoice for a one-time-only vendor and a record for the vendor at the same time.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you want to create multiple one-time vendors and invoices, see <A href="import-and-create-one-time-vendors-and-invoices-public-sector.md">Import and create one-time vendors and invoices (Public sector)</A>.</P>



1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Common** \> **Vendor invoices** \> **Open vendor invoices**.

2.  On the **Action Pane**, in the **New** group, click **Invoice**, and then click **One-time vendor and invoice**.

3.  In the **Create a one-time vendor and invoice** form, in the **Record type** field, specify whether the vendor is a person or an organization.

4.  Fill out the other fields as necessary, and then click **Create**. The **Vendor invoice** form opens, displaying the vendor information.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>For fields in the <STRONG>Create a one-time vendor and invoice</STRONG> form that you donâ€™t enter new values into, the vendor record you are creating uses values from the default one-time vendor account. That account is specified on the <STRONG>General</STRONG> tab in the <STRONG>Accounts payable parameters</STRONG>. To view the account details, go to the <STRONG>All vendors</STRONG> list page and double-click the vendor account number of the default one-time vendor.</P>
