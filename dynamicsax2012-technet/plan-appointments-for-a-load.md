# Plan appointments for a load 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_


> [!NOTE]

Warehouse appointments represent events that occur at a dock for receiving a purchase order, shipping a sales order, or processing an inbound or outbound load at a specific date and time. Appointments are created to reduce the manual work for warehouse personnel. This helps make sure that there is availability of docks for the loading and unloading of goods, and avoids a situation in which multiple carriers arrive at a location at the same time.

## This task is part of a bigger process

Planning appointments for a load can be part of the inbound or outbound processes in a warehouse.

## Prerequisites

The following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you start.

## Schedule appointments for a specific load

You can use the **Appointment scheduling** form to schedule, track, and cancel appointments for a specific load. The appointment type determines the type of location for which the appointments are created. For example, you can specify whether a particular appointment is created for an inbound or outbound dock.

When you cancel an existing appointment, you must select a reason code to specify the reason for cancellation.

1.  Click **Transportation management** \> **Inquiries** \> **Load planning workbench**.

2.  On the **Loads** FastTab, select a load transaction line.

3.  On the **Transportation** menu, click **Appointment scheduling**.

4.  Create a new appointment.

5.  In the **Appointment type** field, select the identifier (ID) for the appointment type.

7.  In the **Appointment status** field, select the status of the appointment.
