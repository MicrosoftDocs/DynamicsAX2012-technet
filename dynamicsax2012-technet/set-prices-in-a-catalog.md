# Set prices in a catalog 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to manage the prices of retail products in catalogs by using price groups. The price group links the catalog and its products with the trade agreements that specify prices. This is especially useful if your company publishes many catalogs and uses many price changes.

To set prices in a catalog, complete the following tasks in this order:

1.  Create a price group

2.  Link the price group to a catalog

3.  Create trade agreements

4.  Send the changes to the stores
