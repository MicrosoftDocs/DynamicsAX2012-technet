# Reporting in Microsoft Dynamics AX 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) is the primary reporting platform for Microsoft Dynamics AX. The default, predefined reports that are provided with Microsoft Dynamics AX run on the Reporting Services platform.

This topic guides you through the process of installing, deploying, and using these reports. This topic also provides information about how to create custom reports.
