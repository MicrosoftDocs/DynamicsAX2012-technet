# Using answers and questions for questionnaire 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Answers and questions are the key components to building a questionnaire.

Answers represent predefined response options that are available to a person who is completing a question on a questionnaire. Answers are always created in an answer group. In the answer group, you can type the answer text and also assign points and correct answer settings for each answer. When you create a question, you can select the appropriate answer group.

Questions can be either open-ended or closed-ended.

Open-ended answers are not controlled in any way and respondents are free to type their answers. Closed-ended questions require a list of predefined response options, and that a respondent can select one or more responses.

Closed-ended questions must be linked to an answer group.
