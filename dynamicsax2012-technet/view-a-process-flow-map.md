After you create a query for a process, substance, or substance category, you can view the query in a process flow map. You can filter the map that you view to highlight substances by name or category. You can also create a new process, process reference, or substance flow from the process flow map.

1.  Click **Compliance and internal controls** \> **Common** \> **Environmental sustainability** \> **Environmental processes** \> **Environmental process maps**.

2.  Select the process flow map to view, and then click **Map**.
