[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use the **Service tasks** page to view a list of service task relations that were created for service agreements or service orders, or to view the details of a specific service task relation. A service task is a generic task that can be assigned to more than one service agreement or service order. The service task relation connects a service task with a service agreement or order.

After a service task relation is set up between a service task and a service agreement or order, you can specify this service task when you create service agreement or order lines.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Service tasks and service task relations are set up in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client.</P>



1.  Click **Service management** on the top link bar, and then click either **Service agreements** or **Service orders** on the Quick Launch. The **Service agreements** or **Service orders** page is displayed.

2.  Select a service agreement or service order, and on the Action Pane click **Service tasks**. The **Service tasks** page is displayed, and shows the service task relations.

3.  To view details about a specific service task relation, click the **Details** icon. The **Service task** page is displayed, where you can view more information about the specific service task relation, such as the external and internal notes for the task.
    
      - Internal notes are notes for the service technician, such as detailed technical requests.
    
      - External notes can be viewed by the customer. They might provide a more generic description of the task that is being completed according to the agreement between the customer and your organization.
