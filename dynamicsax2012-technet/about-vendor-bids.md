# About vendor bids 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how a vendor replies to your request for quotation (RFQ) for goods or services by submitting a bid.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic has been updated to include information about features that were added or changed for <STRONG>Public sector</STRONG> in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3.</P>



Vendors who are registered in the Vendor portal section of Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX can view both open and closed RFQs. These vendors can also bid on an RFQ that you have sent to them or (for Public sector only) published in the portal.

If you have published an RFQ in the Vendor portal, an unregistered Public sector vendor can view RFQs on the public Enterprise Portal site. The vendor can then request to be added to an RFQ. The vendor must sign up, be approved as a vendor, be approved as a vendor user, and provide contact information. The vendor then becomes a registered vendor, and can log on and submit bids.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If vendor has the <STRONG>Public Sector</STRONG> configuration key enabled, additional functionality is available. For example, the vendor can view scoring and award notes for bids that were accepted, regardless of which vendor won the bid.</P>



## Viewing RFQ details

To view your RFQ, vendors follow these steps.

1.  The vendor logs on to Enterprise Portal and then clicks the **Vendor portal** tab at the top of the page to view a list of RFQs.

2.  The vendor can sort and filter the list of RFQs. To see the RFQ details, the vendor clicks the link for the RFQ number.

3.  If you have attached a document, the vendor clicks the icon in the document field to open the attachment.

4.  In AX 2012 R3, if you change or update an RFQ at any time before the vendor submits the bid, the vendor can view those changes on the **Amendments** FastTab.

## Creating a bid on an RFQ

To reply to your RFQ and create a bid, vendors follow these steps in the Vendor portal.

1.  In the RFQ, on the **Action Pane**, the vendor clicks **Bid**.

2.  The vendor transfers the header information and information on the lines, such as quantity, from the RFQ to the bid. The vendor then verifies the dates and other information in the header, and makes any changes that are required.

3.  The vendor updates the information for each line in the bid.

4.  The vendor can attach a document to the bid and answer any questionnaire that you have attached to the RFQ.

5.  In AX 2012 R3, the vendor can add alternate lines and optional comments if you have allowed alternates in the RFQ.

## Submitting the bid

To submit the bid to you, vendors follow this step in the Vendor portal.

  - In the RFQ reply form, on the **Action Pane**, the vendor clicks **Submit**.

## Next step

Your next step, after the RFQ expiration date and time pass, is to select which replies (bids) to accept and which to reject. In AX 2012 R3, you can score and rank bids to help determine which one to accept. You can also resubmit an RFQ reply to a vendor if you require additional information.
