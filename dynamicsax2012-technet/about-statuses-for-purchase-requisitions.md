# About statuses for purchase requisitions 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When you create a purchase requisition, it is assigned a status. Each line that you add to a purchase requisition is also assigned a status. When you submit a purchase requisition to workflow for review, the status of the purchase requisition and the status of each line are updated as the lines move through the purchase requisition process.

You can configure the purchase requisition workflow process to route a purchase requisition through the review process as a single document. Alternatively, the lines on a purchase requisition can be routed individually to the appropriate reviewers. If the purchase requisition lines are reviewed individually, the purchase requisition line status can be updated as the line moves through the review process. When all lines have completed the review process and there are no review steps remaining for the purchase requisition, the status for the whole purchase requisition is updated.

## Purchase requisition status process flow

The following diagram illustrates the statuses that are assigned to a purchase requisition and purchase requisition line as it moves through the workflow process.

## Purchase requisition header and line status relationships

The overall status of a purchase requisition is controlled by the status of the purchase requisition lines. Therefore, the review process must be completed for all purchase requisition lines before the review process for the purchase requisition can be completed.

The following table describes the statuses that are assigned to a purchase requisition header and lines as the purchase requisition moves through the process.

## New or changed for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, requisition demand can now be fulfilled by a purchase order, a transfer order, a production order, or kanban depending on the needs of your organization and how it is set up. The requisition purpose and the corresponding policy rules that have been defined for a specific legal entity determine the fulfillment method. For more information, see [About purchase requisitions](about-purchase-requisitions.md).
