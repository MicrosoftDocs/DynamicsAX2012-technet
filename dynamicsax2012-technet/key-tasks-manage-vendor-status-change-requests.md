# Key tasks: Manage vendor status change requests 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When an employee wants to work with a vendor that is on hold, the employee can request to have the vendor's hold status changed. As a reviewer, you are responsible for reviewing new vendor status change requests, and for approving or rejecting them. Employees submit vendor status change requests by using the Employee services site in Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX.

**Prerequisites**

  - A system administrator must set up the workflow tasks for the vendor request process. For more information about the workflow tasks, see [Setting up and maintaining procurement and sourcing workflows](setting-up-and-maintaining-procurement-and-sourcing-workflows.md).

  - A system administrator must set up the **Vendor status change request** page for the Employee services site in Enterprise Portal. For more information about how to configure the **Vendor status change request** page, see [Set up vendor status change requests](set-up-vendor-status-change-requests.md).
