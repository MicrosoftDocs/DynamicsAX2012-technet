Question types are required. When you create a new question, you must assign a question type to it. For more information, see [Prerequisites for questionnaire](prerequisites-for-questionnaire.md).

Use question types to categorize questions for reporting. Question types also make it easier to find questions to use by filtering in the **Questions** form.

Examples of question types include the following:

  - Human resource

  - Managing business

  - Course evaluation
