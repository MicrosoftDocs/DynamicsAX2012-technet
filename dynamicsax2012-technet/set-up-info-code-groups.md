# Set up info code groups 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic describes how to set up info code groups. Info code groups enable you to group predefined info codes together so that you can easily re-use them. You can also specify the order in which info codes are displayed to the user without manually creating dependencies between them.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Before you can set up info code groups, you must define info codes. For more information about how to set up info codes, see <A href="set-up-info-codes.md">Set up info codes</A>.</P>



To set up info code groups, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Info code groups**.

2.  In the **Info code groups** form, enter a name for the info code group.

3.  Click **Add** to select info codes to add to the info code group.

4.  For each info code that you add, in the **Priority** field, enter a number to signify the order in which you want the info code to be displayed. The highest priority is signified by 0 (zero). Enter **0** (zero) for the info code that you want to be displayed first, enter **1** for the info code that you want to be displayed second, and so on.
