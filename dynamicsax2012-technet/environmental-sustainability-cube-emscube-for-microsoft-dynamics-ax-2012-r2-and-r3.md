# Environmental sustainability cube (EMSCube) for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 and R3 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

The Environmental sustainability cube for Microsoft Dynamics AX provides data that can help you track your organization’s energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, your organization can take a more proactive approach to environmental issues. This article provides details about the cube.

## Deployment

The Environmental sustainability cube is included in the Dynamics AX project. For information about how deploy the Dynamics AX project—and the cubes that it contains—see [Deploy the default cubes](deploy-the-default-cubes.md).

## Configuration keys

The following configuration keys are required to use all features of the Environmental sustainability cube:

  - Environmental sustainability (EMS)

## Tables and views

The Environmental sustainability cube uses data from the following tables and views:

  - EMSProcess table

  - EMSSubstance table

  - EMSSubstanceCategory table

  - EMSDailyFlowView view

## Measures

The Environmental sustainability cube includes the following measure groups.

## Substance flow details

This measure group is based on the EMSDailyFlowView view and includes the following measures.
