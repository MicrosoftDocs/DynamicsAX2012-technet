# Copy a functional area from another tenant [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can copy a functional area from another tenant and use the copied information as the basis for a new functional area in Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services. You can then modify the new functional area to meet your configuration goals.

1.  In the RapidStart Services header, click **Design**, and then click **Functional area**.

2.  Click the arrow on the **Functional area** button, and then click **Copy functional area from**.

3.  In the **Copy functional area from** form, select the check box next to the name of the functional area that you want to copy.

4.  In the **NewName** field, enter the name that you want to give this functional area in the tenant that you are currently working in.

5.  Click **Copy**.

You can now modify the new functional area by adding or removing question groups.
