# Set up environmental parameters 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In the **Parameters** form, you determine the point at which the environmental impact of a purchase order transaction is calculated. You can also use this form to set the number sequences for environmental sustainability records. You define number sequence codes in the **Number sequences** form. For more information, see [Number sequences (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh209531\(v=ax.60\)). You must define number sequences for substance flows to allow substance flow information to appear on invoices created in the **Invoice register** or in **Purchase order** forms. When you define a number sequence code for a substance flow, you cannot set the code to manual.

1.  Click **Compliance and internal controls** \> **Setup** \> **Environmental sustainability** \> **Environmental parameters**.

2.  On the **Conversion time** tab, select whether the environmental impact for a purchase order is calculated when the purchase order is received or when it is invoiced.

3.  On the **Number sequences** tab, select a number sequence code to identify processes, meters, substance flows, and environmental conversions.
