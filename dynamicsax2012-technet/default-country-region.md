# Default country/region 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, all postal addresses must have a corresponding country/region. Use this form to validate and update the default country/region code for each company in your organization. When you upgrade from Microsoft Dynamics AX 4.0 or Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, the country/region that you select here for a company becomes the country/region for address records in that company that do not have a specified country/region. After you have completed the **Prepare application data for preprocessing section** of the **Preprocessing upgrade checklist**, you can use the **Addresses with no country/region** form to change the country/region for an address record.

1.  In the **Preprocessing upgrade checklist**, click **Default country/region** to open the **Default country/region for addresses** form.

2.  Review the country/region that is assigned to the companies in the list. This is the country/region code that will be assigned to any address that does not already have a country/region code assigned.

3.  To change the country/region for a company, select a country/region in the **Default country/region code** field.

4.  After you have verified the country/region defaults for each company, click the **Set to ready for upgrade** button.
