<td><p>Replaced by another feature</p></td>
<td><p>Yes. The feature was deprecated, and a replacement feature is available. The X++ Workflow API was replaced by the managed Workflow API, because the following features were planned for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Additional workflow features, such as advanced flow controls</p></li>
<li><p>A new managed workflow editor, which requires a managed programmatic interface</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the Workflow API was refactored as a managed API, and support for the new workflow features and workflow editor was added.</p>
