## What’s new in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 Cumulative Update 9

For the straight-line-life remaining depreciation method, a new parameter is added to allow you to apply rules for additional acquisition and acquisition adjustment transactions. After you enable the parameter, the depreciation of additional acquisitions and acquisition adjustments is calculated according to the following rules:

  - The amounts of additional acquisitions that are posted during the year of initial acquisition are depreciated starting from the depreciation run date.

  - The amounts of additional acquisitions posted in the year later than year of initial acquisition are depreciated starting from the first day of the year.

  - The amount of additional depreciation is added to the periodic depreciation amount in the respective period.

If you create depreciation adjustments with basis adjustments marked on the Fixed asset value model, the depreciation adjustment transaction will be created according to the following rules:

  - For additional acquisitions posted in the year of initial acquisition, the depreciation amount is adjusted starting from the depreciation run date.

  - For additional acquisitions posted in the year later than year of initial acquisition, the depreciation amounts are adjusted starting from the first date of the year.
