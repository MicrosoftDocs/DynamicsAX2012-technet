# Analytics in Microsoft Dynamics AX 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Microsoft Dynamics AX provides online analytical processing (OLAP) functionality through the use of cubes. These cubes, built on the Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services platform, enable you to analyze large amounts of data and identify trends that you might not otherwise discover when viewing data on traditional reports.

Microsoft Dynamics AX includes default cubes that you can use in your Microsoft Dynamics AX implementation. This article guides you through the process of installing, deploying, and using these cubes. This article also provides information about how to customize the default cubes and create new ones.

A cube is a multidimensional structure that contains dimensions and measures. Dimensions define the structure of the cube, while measures provide the numerical values of interest to the end user. Cell positions in the cube are defined by the intersection of dimension members, and the measure values are aggregated to provide the values in the cells.

The following table lists tasks you can complete to learn more about cubes and how you can use them in your Microsoft Dynamics AX implementation.

The Business Intelligence infrastructure enables you to generate Unified Dimensional Models (UDMs) by using metadata from the Microsoft Dynamics AX relational data model. You can specify measures and dimensions in the AOT to define an analysis cube. You can create, update, deploy, and configure Analysis Services projects by using the Analysis Services project wizard. You can browse cubes, dimensions, and data source views in SQL Server Business Intelligence Development Studio (BIDS). You can also create or modify dimension usage, key performance indicators (KPIs), and organization hierarchies in BIDS.
