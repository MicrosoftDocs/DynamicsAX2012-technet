## Goal activities

A goal might be divided up into several activities that must be completed before you can complete the goal. After you create a goal, you can specify the activities to associate with the goal and then track the status of those activities. For more information, see [Add, modify, and remove goal activities](add-modify-and-remove-goal-activities.md).

## Goal comments

You can add a comment to a goal to provide additional information about the goal. After a goal is created, you cannot modify the goal or the goal type, which helps to ensure that the information in the goal remains consistent. However, you can add a comment to a goal to indicate that the goal has changed. For more information, see [Add and remove goal comments](add-and-remove-goal-comments.md).
