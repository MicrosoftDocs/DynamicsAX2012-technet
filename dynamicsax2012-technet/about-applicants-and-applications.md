# About applicants and applications 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

An applicant is a person who applies for a job within your legal entity. You can maintain information about applicants and about their application for employment in Human resources.

You can maintain interview dates and times, references, competencies, accommodation requests, and personal information for applicants, as well as update the status of applicants’ applications for employment and create letters or emails in order to communicate with applicants. When you create an applicant record, a person record for that applicant is created in the global address book.

You can use the **Applicant** form to update the following global address book information for people who are applicants:

  - Address information

  - Contact information

  - Identification information

  - Name details

  - Personal information

## Hiring applicants

Use the **Applications** list page or the **Application** form to hire an applicant. When you hire an applicant, the applicant’s record will have a status of **Employed** and the applicant’s global address book person record is associated with the new worker record. Modifications to the global address book information for the new worker record are also displayed in the applicant record. This can help reduce data entry if the new worker ever applies for a different job within your legal entity.

## Employment applications

You can record information from employment applications that you receive in the **Application** form. Applications are typically submitted as hard copy documents that are delivered by mail or in person, or from the web in response to an online job advertisement.

Employment applications submitted by applicants on the web are either solicited applications that were entered in response to a job ad, or are unsolicited applications. Solicited applications are automatically associated to the recruitment project that the job ad was created from. Unsolicited applications are associated with the recruitment project that is specified in the **Set up recruiting** area of the **Human resources parameters** form.

## Correspondence actions

An application’s correspondence action determines the document or email template that you use to communicate with the applicant who submitted the application. For more information, see [Key tasks: Applicants](key-tasks-applicants.md).

## Application status

The application status indicates where an application is in the recruitment process. The following table lists the possible application statuses and their description.

## Application routing

If an application must be reviewed by several workers, you can use the **Application routing** form to create a worker circulation list in order to manage the process. For more information, see [Application routing (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa598738\(v=ax.60\)).
