# Setting up and maintaining Cash and bank management 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can create and manage legal entity bank accounts and the financial instruments that are associated with bank accounts, such as deposit slips, checks, bills of exchange, and promissory notes.

You also create bank groups, bank transaction types, the bank accounts that the legal entity has in each bank group, and check layouts for the bank accounts.

You can view bank data by using standard inquiries, reconcile bank statements, and print bank data in standard reports. This data includes balances, payment lists, summaries, deposit slips, payment advice, and bank transactions that are not reconciled.

The topics in this section provide information about setting up and maintaining Cash and bank management.
