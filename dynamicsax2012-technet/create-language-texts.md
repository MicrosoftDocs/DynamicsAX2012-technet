Important information, such as terms of payment and terms of delivery, can be printed in other languages on documents. This is helpful when you are trading with companies from other countries or regions. Before you can print the information in another language, you must create the text for that language. The language text option is available only on selected forms.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Creating language texts for additional languages requires a license.</P>



## Create a new language text

1.  In the appropriate form, press CTRL+N to create a new line, and then enter the text in your own language.

2.  Click **Translations**.

3.  In the **Language** list, select the language for the text that you are creating.

4.  In the **Text** window, enter the text in the selected language.

## Example

Your company is located in an English-speaking country, and you want to create German text for "reason for delivery" on the packing slip.

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Setup** \> **Distribution** \> **Reasons for delivery**.

2.  Click **Translations**.

3.  Press CTRL+N to create a new language text.
