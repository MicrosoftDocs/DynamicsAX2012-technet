# Create allocation rule source and destination information 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use the **Ledger allocation rule source** form to define the source information for the allocation rule.

Use the **Ledger allocation rule destination** form to define the destination information for the allocation rule.

## Create allocation rule source information

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **Posting** \> **Ledger allocation rule**.

2.  Click **Source** to open the **Ledger allocation rule source** form.
    

    > [!TIP]
    > <P>If you are creating a new allocation rule, you must select an allocation method on the <STRONG>General</STRONG> tab before you can click <STRONG>Source</STRONG>.</P>



3.  Click **New** to create a source line.

4.  Select to allocate from an account or from an account and dimension combination.

5.  If you selected **Financial dimension** in the **Field setting** field, select a financial dimension.

6.  Enter the account or dimension source criteria information to allocate from. You can use wildcard characters.
    
    For example, suppose that you want to allocate a utility expense, such as telephone and fax costs. The chart of accounts is set up so that a ledger account that starts with 61 indicates the account where utilities expenses are posted. You could define the source criteria as one of the following.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 33%" />
    <col style="width: 33%" />
    <col style="width: 33%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><p>Wildcard characters</p></th>
    <th><p>Example entry</p></th>
    <th><p>What is displayed</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>ALL</p></td>
    <td><p>61*</p></td>
    <td><p>All accounts or financial dimensions that begin with 61</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p>RANGE</p></td>
    <td><p>6100..6110</p></td>
    <td><p>All accounts or financial dimensions that include, or are between, 6100 and 6110</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>LIST</p></td>
    <td><p>6100, 6110</p></td>
    <td><p>The accounts or financial dimensions that are numbered 6100 and 6110</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p>BLANK</p></td>
    <td><p></p></td>
    <td><p>All accounts and financial dimensions</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
