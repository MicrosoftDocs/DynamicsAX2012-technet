# (BRA) About check payments and Bordero payments 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can use a check or Bordero method of payment to make vendor payments. When you use a check, you can generate one check for a combination of a specific payment date, a vendor, and a bank, or you can generate one check for a specific payment date for each bank. The check that is issued has the vendor or the bank as the nominee. When you use the Bordero payment, you can generate one Bordero for a specific payment date for each bank. You can also generate the Bordero report.

You can reverse a check or Bordero payment. When you reverse a payment, the transaction is canceled, and the related vendor invoices are available for settlement. If taxes were withheld from the check or Bordero payment, the withholding taxes are also reversed.

You can perform the following tasks:

  - Set up a custom check layout to print checks for a bank. For more information, see [(BRA) Set up a custom check layout for a bank](bra-set-up-a-custom-check-layout-for-a-bank.md).

  - Set up a continuous number sequence for Bordero payments. For more information, see [(BRA) Set up a number sequence for Bordero payments](bra-set-up-a-number-sequence-for-bordero-payments.md).

  - Set up a vendor method of payment for checks or Bordero payments. For more information, see [(BRA) Set up a check or Bordero method of payment for a vendor](bra-set-up-a-check-or-bordero-method-of-payment-for-a-vendor.md).

  - Post a vendor payment with the check or Bordero method of payment. For more information, see [(BRA) Post a payment with the check method of payment](bra-post-a-payment-with-the-check-method-of-payment.md) and [(BRA) Post a payment with the Bordero method of payment and generate the Bordero report](bra-post-a-payment-with-the-bordero-method-of-payment-and-generate-the-bordero-report.md).
