# Set up depreciation profiles 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The purpose of a depreciation profile is to allocate, or accrue, the depreciable value of a fixed asset into multiple fiscal periods.

You can create an unlimited number of depreciation profiles. You also can create various depreciation profiles with the same depreciation method for different calculations. For example, you can create several profiles for reducing balance, such as 10 percent, 15 percent, and 30 percent, and you can create several manual methods and several consumption methods.

1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Setup** \> **Depreciation** \> **Depreciation profiles**.

2.  Click **New** to create a depreciation profile.

3.  Enter a unique identifier in the **Depreciation profile** field.

4.  Select a depreciation method in the **Method** field. The following depreciation methods can be used:
