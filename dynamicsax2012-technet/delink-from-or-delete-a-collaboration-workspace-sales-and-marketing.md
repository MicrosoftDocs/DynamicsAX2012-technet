# Delink from or delete a collaboration workspace (Sales and marketing) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When an opportunity or campaign no longer requires a collaboration workspace, you can either remove its association with the workspace or delete the collaboration workspace entirely.

If you attempt to delete a collaboration workspace that is associated with other campaigns, opportunities, or projects, Microsoft Dynamics AX delinks the workspace from the business area that you are working on, but the workspace is not deleted.

2.  Select or open the opportunity that you want to delink from its collaboration workspace.
