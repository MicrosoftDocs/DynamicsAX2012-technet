# Key tasks: Work with vendor search and search results 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You may want to select a group of vendors or locate a specific vendor in your organization's list of approved vendors. For example, you are creating a request for quotations (RFQ), and you want to contact all of the approved vendors who are in a specific geographical area. Because your organization has many vendors, locating all of the vendors that you want can be time-consuming. However, you can search for a vendor or a group of vendors by defining criteria, such as geographical area, in the **Vendor search** form.

In the search results, you can view the profile for current, prospective, and unsolicited vendors. You can request to add an unsolicited vendor as an approved vendor for your organization. If your assigned role has the required permissions, you can create an RFQ, a purchase requisition, or a purchase order for a current vendor. You can also add a current vendor to another legal entity and create a new vendor from an unsolicited vendor who is listed in the search results.

You can create an RFQ for a current vendor if the vendor has a hold status of **No**, **Invoice**, **Payment**, or **Never**. You cannot create an RFQ if the vendor has a hold status of **All** or **Requisition**. A vendor can have the following hold statuses:

  - **No** – No transaction types are on hold for the vendor.

  - **Invoice** – No invoices can be created or posted for the vendor.

  - **All** – All transactions with this vendor are on hold.

  - **Payment** – No payments can be generated for the vendor.

  - **Requisition** – No requisitions can be created for the vendor.

  - **Never** – No transaction types are on hold for the vendor, and the vendor cannot automatically be put on hold because of inactivity. This status is used for vendors who are used regularly but infrequently. For example, you can use the **Never** hold status for a vendor who does some kind of annual maintenance.
