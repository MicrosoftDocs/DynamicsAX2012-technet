This topic describes how to set up info code groups. Info code groups let you group predefined info codes together so that you can easily reuse them. You can also specify the order in which info codes are displayed to the user, without manually creating dependencies between them.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Before you can set up info code groups, you must define info codes. For more information about how to set up info codes, see <A href="set-up-info-codes-retail-essentials.md">Set up info codes (Retail essentials)</A>.</P>



To set up info code groups, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Retail essentials** \> **Channels** \> **Setup** \> **POS** \> **Info code groups**.

2.  In the **Info code groups** form, enter a name for the info code group.

3.  Click **Add** to select info codes to add to the info code group.

4.  For each info code that you add, in the **Priority** field, enter a number to signify the order in which you want the info code to be displayed. The highest priority is signified by **0** (zero). Enter **0** (zero) for the info code that you want to be displayed first, enter **1** for the info code that you want to be displayed second, and so on.
