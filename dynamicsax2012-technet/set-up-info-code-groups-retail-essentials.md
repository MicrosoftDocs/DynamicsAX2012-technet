2.  In the **Info code groups** form, enter a name for the info code group.

3.  Click **Add** to select info codes to add to the info code group.

4.  For each info code that you add, in the **Priority** field, enter a number to signify the order in which you want the info code to be displayed. The highest priority is signified by **0** (zero). Enter **0** (zero) for the info code that you want to be displayed first, enter **1** for the info code that you want to be displayed second, and so on.
