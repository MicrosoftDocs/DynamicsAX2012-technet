# (USA) Organize and edit products in Commerce Services 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

After you synchronize products between Commerce Services and Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can organize the products in Commerce Services into catalogs, departments, and categories, and then list them in marketplaces and online stores. Organizing your items into departments and categories helps customers locate related items when they are shopping in your marketplaces or online stores. Departments are at the top-level, and you can have multiple categories within a department.

You can map categories to marketplace categories, so that you don’t have to add them individually. For example, you can map eBay’s categories and subcategories to the Commerce Services departments or categories.

After you create departments and categories, you can assign the departments (along with their items and any categories) to the catalogs that you create.

You can also edit the properties of your products and add images of them to make your products more appealing to customers.
