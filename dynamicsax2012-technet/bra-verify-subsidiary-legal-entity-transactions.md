# (BRA) Verify subsidiary legal entity transactions [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use the **Account number %1** form to view the original transactions of a subsidiary legal entity after the transactions are transferred to a consolidated legal entity. You can also view the original voucher and posted sales tax transactions of a subsidiary legal entity by using the **Voucher number %1, %2** and **Posted sales tax** forms.

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Common** \> **Main accounts**.

2.  Select a main account, and then click **Posted**.

3.  Select a subsidiary legal entity transaction, and then click **Subsidiary account transactions**. The default legal entity—that is, the consolidated legal entity—is changed to the subsidiary legal entity, and the transactions of the selected ledger account are displayed in the form.

4.  Click **Original document** to view the original document for the journal entry.

5.  Close the form.

6.  Click **Voucher** to view the original voucher transactions.

7.  Click **Posted sales tax** to view the original sales tax transactions.

8.  Close the forms. The default legal entity is changed to the consolidated legal entity.
