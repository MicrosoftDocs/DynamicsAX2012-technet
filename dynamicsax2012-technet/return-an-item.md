# Return an item 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

If you have ordered an item that you want to return, you can use the **Create return order** page to create a return order for the items. For example, you might want to return an item when it is defective or when you received an incorrect quantity. A return order must be created before the returned items can be received into the warehouse.

1.  Click **Invoices** on the Quick Launch.

2.  On the **Customer invoices** page, select the invoice that includes the item to return.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Customer invoice** tab, in the **New** group, click **Return order**.

4.  On the **Create return order** page, in the **Return reason code** field, select the reason why you are returning the item.

5.  On the **Lines** FastTab, select the check box for the item that you are returning. You can include multiple items on the same return order.

6.  In the **Return quantity** field for the item, enter the quantity of items that you are returning, as a negative value. For example, if you are returning 11 items, you would enter **-11.00**.

7.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Edit** tab, in the **Commit** group, click **Create** to create the return order.
    
    The return order now appears on the **All return orders** page. For more information, see [View return orders](view-return-orders.md) and [View your return orders](view-your-return-orders.md).
