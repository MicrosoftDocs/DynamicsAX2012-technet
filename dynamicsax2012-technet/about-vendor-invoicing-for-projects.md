# About vendor invoicing for projects 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When you order an item from a vendor and assign the item to a project, the line property that you select for a purchase order line for an item determines whether the purchased item is invoiced to a customer. If you set up default line properties in the **Line properties** form, the default line properties are displayed for the item on the purchase order line. You can modify the line property in one of the following ways:

  - To invoice the project's customer for the item, set the line property for the item to a chargeable value on the purchase order.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>When you use this method, you must invoice the customer by using the project invoice features in <STRONG>Project management and accounting</STRONG>.</P>



  - If you do not want to invoice the project's customer for the item, do not select the **Chargeable** line property on the purchase order line for the item. You can invoice the purchase order and no further action needs to be taken.
