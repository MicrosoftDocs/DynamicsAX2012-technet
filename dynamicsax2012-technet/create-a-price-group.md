# Create a price group 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to create price groups in Retail. A price group is the key link in managing prices and discounts for retail products in specific channels, catalogs, affiliations, and loyalty programs. For example, you could create a price group called “Student” and use it to link several different discounts to specific stores and to an affiliation.

To create a price group, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Pricing and discounts** \> **Price groups**.

2.  In the **Price groups** form, click **New** to create a new price group.

3.  In the **Price groups** field, enter a unique ID number for the price group, and then, in the **Name** field, enter a descriptive name for the price group.

4.  If the price group is exclusively a retail price group, select the **Retail** check box. Only these price groups are available for retail-specific discounts.
