# (RUS) About transportation invoices and job tickets that are based on bills of lading [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

In the Russian Federation, all cargo that is transported by using an automobile carrier must be accompanied by one of the following documents:

  - Transportation invoice – The documented proof of a transportation agreement.

  - Job ticket – The documented proof of a vehicle chartering agreement.

You can generate and print a transportation invoice and a job ticket for a sales order or transfer order. You can also print a transportation invoice and a job ticket from a bill of lading, which you can access from multiple forms. These forms include the packing slip journal, invoice journal, transfer order, and shipment.

You must complete the following setup procedures before you can generate and print a transportation invoice and a job ticket:

  - [(RUS) Set up accounts receivable parameters to generate a transportation invoice and a job ticket that are based on a bill of lading](rus-set-up-accounts-receivable-parameters-to-generate-a-transportation-invoice-and-a-job-ticket-that-are-based-on-a-bill-of-lading.md)
