In the Russian Federation, all cargo that is transported by using an automobile carrier must be accompanied by one of the following documents:

  - Transportation invoice – The documented proof of a transportation agreement.

  - Job ticket – The documented proof of a vehicle chartering agreement.

You can generate and print a transportation invoice and a job ticket for a sales order or transfer order. You can also print a transportation invoice and a job ticket from a bill of lading, which you can access from multiple forms. These forms include the packing slip journal, invoice journal, transfer order, and shipment.
