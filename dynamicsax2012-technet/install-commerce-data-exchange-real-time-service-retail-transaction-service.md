# Install Commerce Data Exchange: Real-time Service (Retail Transaction Service) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

This topic explains how to install Commerce Data Exchange: Real-time Service. Real-time Service is an integrated service that provides real-time communication between Microsoft Dynamics AX and retail channels. Real-time Service enables individual point of sale (POS) computers and online stores to retrieve specific data from Microsoft Dynamics AX in real time.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Components of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 for Retail are available with Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, and Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack.</P>



At the head office, install Real-time Service on the communications server. Deployment steps vary, depending on the version that you are installing:

  - In AX 2012 R3 and AX 2012 R2, Real-time Service is a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service that must be installed on a website in Internet Information Services (IIS).

  - In AX 2012 Feature Pack, Real-time Service is a Windows service that is called Retail Transaction Service.

When you install this component, the Retail Salt Utility is also installed. The Retail Salt Utility provides extra encryption for the passwords and credentials that are associated with the Retail system.

The following sections are included in this topic:

  - Before you install Real-time Service

  - Install Real-time Service by using Setup (AX 2012 R3)

  - Install Real-time Service by using Windows PowerShell (AX 2012 R3)

  - Install Real-time Service (AX 2012 Feature Pack or AX 2012 R2)

  - Deploy Real-time Service (required for AX 2012 R2 only)

  - After you install and deploy Real-time Service

## Before you install Real-time Service

  - Create the service account that will be used as the application pool identity for the Real-time Service website. In AX 2012 Feature Pack, this account is used as the identity for the Windows service. For more information about the requirements for this account, see [Create service accounts](create-service-accounts.md).

  - 
    
    Because this component uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption, you must install a server certificate that was issued by a trusted certification authority. (For test environments, you can create a self-signed certificate in IIS.) When you run Setup, you will need to enter the thumbprint for the certificate. To view the thumbprint in IIS Manager, double-click the certificate and click the **Details** tab.

  - On the computer where you plan to install this component, run the prerequisite validation utility to verify that system requirements have been met. For information about how to run the prerequisite validation utility, see [Check prerequisites](check-prerequisites.md).
    
    For more information about the hardware and software requirements for Microsoft Dynamics AX, see the [system requirements](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=165377).

  - Real-time Service requires .NET Business Connector. The .NET Business Connector enables Real-time Service to interact with instances of Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Object Server (AOS). If .NET Business Connector is not already installed, it is selected automatically when you select to install Real-time Service.

## Option 1: Install Real-time Service by using Setup (AX 2012 R3)

Use this procedure to install Real-time Service for AX 2012 R3. If you install other Microsoft Dynamics AX components at the same time, the installation pages vary, depending on the components that you are installing.

To deploy Real-time Service on multiple computers in a cluster, you can run Setup on each computer. Alternatively, you can use the Retail mass deployment toolkit to deploy Real-time Service from a central location. For information about how to set up an IIS cluster, see the [Network Load Balancing Deployment Guide](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754833\(v=ws.10\).aspx). For more information about mass deployment, see [Mass deploy Retail components by using System Center Configuration Manager](mass-deploy-retail-components-by-using-system-center-configuration-manager.md).

1.  Start Microsoft Dynamics AX Setup. Under **Install**, select **Microsoft Dynamics AX components**.

2.  Advance through the first wizard pages.

3.  If the Setup Support files have not yet been installed on this computer, the **Select a file location** page is displayed. The Setup Support files are required for installation. Provide a file location or accept the default location, and then click **Next**. On the **Ready to install** page, click **Install**.

4.  On the **Select an installation option** page, click **Microsoft Dynamics AX**, and then click **Next**.

5.  On the **Select installation type** page, click **Custom installation**, and then click **Next**.

6.  On the **Select components** page, select **Real-time Service**, and then click **Next**.

7.  On the **Prerequisite validation results** page, resolve any errors. For more information about how to resolve prerequisite errors, see [Check prerequisites](check-prerequisites.md). When no errors remain, click **Next**.

8.  If you are installing on a 64-bit operating system, the **Select a file location** page is displayed. Select the location in which to install 32-bit versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX files, and then click **Next**.

9.  On the **Select a display language** page, select the language in which to run Microsoft Dynamics AX for the first time.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>.NET Business Connector is a kind of Microsoft Dynamics AX client. Therefore, if .NET Business Connector is the first client that you install on a computer, Setup requires that you set the display language.</P>



10. On the **Specify a location for configuration settings** page, specify whether you want .NET Business Connector to access configuration information from the registry on the local computer or from a shared configuration file. If you want to use a shared configuration file, you must enter the network location of the file. Click **Next**.

11. On the **Connect to AOS instance** page, enter the name of the computer that runs the instance of AOS to connect to. You can optionally specify the name of the AOS instance and the TCP/IP port number. Click **Next**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If you entered information about the AOS connection for other Microsoft Dynamics AX components that are installed on this computer, this page is not displayed. Subsequent installations on the same computer reuse the existing AOS connection.</P>



12. On the **Specify Business Connector proxy account information** page, enter the password for the proxy account that is used by .NET Business Connector. Click **Next**.

13. On the **Configure Real-time Service** page, select the check box to configure Real-time Service by using Setup. If you clear this check box, the application files are installed, but Real-time Service is not configured.
    
    If you’re configuring Real-time Service, enter the following information:
    
      - **Application name** – The name of the web application that hosts Real-time Service.
    
      - **Website name** – The name of the website that hosts Real-time Service.
    
      - **App pool name** – The name of the application pool that Real-time Service runs in.
        
        We recommend that you specify separate application pools if multiple Retail components are installed on the same computer. Multiple web applications can share an application pool if resources on the computer are limited. However, if the shared application pool fails, all of the applications that use it will stop responding. In addition, if one application is heavily used, it can negatively affect the performance of the other applications in the pool.
    
      - **User name** and **Password** – The credentials for the application pool identity.
    
      - **HTTPS port** – The port on which Real-time Service receives secure HTTP requests. You can specify any available port. Verify that the port is open in Windows Firewall.
        

        > [!WARNING]
        > <P>To avoid conflicts with the Default Web Site on the computer, we recommend that you do not use the default HTTPS port (443).&nbsp;A nonstandard port number also helps make the website more secure.</P>

    
      - **TCP port** – The port on which Real-time Service receives TCP requests. You can specify any available port. Verify that the port is open in Windows Firewall.
    
      - **SSL certificate thumbprint** – The thumbprint for your Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption certificate. You must obtain a valid, registered certificate from a provider.

14. On the **Prerequisite validation results** page, resolve any errors. For more information about how to resolve prerequisite errors, see [Check prerequisites](check-prerequisites.md). When no errors remain, click **Next**.

15. On the **Ready to install** page, click **Install**.

16. After the installation is completed, click **Finish** to close the wizard.

## Option 2: Install Real-time Service by using Windows PowerShell (AX 2012 R3)

Use this procedure to manually install Real-time Service for AX 2012 R3 by using Windows PowerShell. To install multiple instances of Real-time Service on the same computer, you must use a manual installation. Manual installations are often performed by businesses and organizations that automate deployments by using scripts.

### ![Hh575229.collapse\_all(en-us,AX.60).gif](images/Gg841655.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif "Hh575229.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif")Run Windows PowerShell scripts to configure Real-time Service

After you configure the parameters in the rts-settings.xml file, you can run the Windows PowerShell scripts that configure Real-time Service.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Windows PowerShell includes a security setting called the execution policy that determines how scripts are run. By default, the execution policy is set to <STRONG>Restricted</STRONG>, which prevents any scripts from running. To run the installation scripts for Microsoft Dynamics AX components, we recommend that you set the execution policy to <STRONG>RemoteSigned</STRONG> by using Set-ExecutionPolicy cmdlet. This setting allows you to run scripts that you’ve written and scripts that have been signed by a trusted publisher.</P>



1.  On the server where you want to run the script, open Windows PowerShell to the folder where the scripts are installed. By default, the files are located at C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Dynamics AX\\60\\CDX\\Real-time Services\\Tools.
    
      - If you’re using Windows Server 2012 or a later operating system, use Windows Explorer to open the folder where the scripts are installed. Then click **File** \> **Open Windows PowerShell** \> **Open Windows PowerShell as administrator**.
    
      - If you’re using Windows Server 2008 R2 or an earlier operating system, start Windows PowerShell as the administrator. Then, change the directory by using the following command: CD "\<Path to directory\>".

2.  In the Windows PowerShell console, run the following command to create a credential object for the application pool identity.
    
    ``` powershell
    $Cred = @((New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('domain\user',(ConvertTo-SecureString 'password' -AsPlainText -Force))))
    ```

3.  Run the following command to configure Real-time Service.
    
    ``` powershell
    .\DeployRealtimeService.ps1 -SettingsXmlFilePath .\rts-settings.xml -TopologyXmlFilePath .\rts-topology.xml -Credentials $Cred –Verbose $true
    ```
    
    Example:
    
    .\\DeployRealtimeService.ps1 -SettingsXmlFilePath “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Dynamics AX\\60\\CDX\\Real-time Services\\Tools\\rts-settings.xml” -TopologyXmlFilePath “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Dynamics AX\\60\\CDX\\Real-time Services\\Tools\\rts-topology.xml” -Credentials $Cred -Verbose $true

> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you are not using AX 2012 R2, you can skip this procedure. In AX 2012 Feature Pack, Real-time Service is not a web service. In AX 2012 R3, Setup performs these steps for you.</P>



When you install Real-time Service for AX 2012 R2 by using the Setup wizard, the following resources are installed:

  - A folder that contains the binaries and configuration files for the WCF service

  - A folder that contains sample Windows PowerShell scripts

Use these resources to manually deploy and configure the WCF service that is used by Real-time Service.

### ![Hh575229.collapse\_all(en-us,AX.60).gif](images/Gg841655.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif "Hh575229.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif")Request and install a server certificate for the website

Because this component uses SSL encryption, you must install a server certificate that was issued by a trusted certification authority. (For test environments, you can create a self-signed certificate in IIS.) When you run the script to install Real-time Service, you have to enter the thumbprint for the certificate. To view the thumbprint in IIS Manager, double-click the certificate, and then click the **Details** tab. We recommend that you first copy the thumbprint, paste it into a text file, and remove all spaces. Then copy the reformatted thumbprint, and paste it into Windows PowerShell.
