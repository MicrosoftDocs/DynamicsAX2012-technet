# Setting up info codes (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

You can use info codes to prompt the cashier to take some action or to capture data at the point-of-sale (POS) register during a transaction. For example, an info code can prompt the cashier to ask the customer for identification, to suggest upsell products, or to choose the reason for a return.

Additionally, you can link subcodes to info codes. Subcodes provide the possible responses to questions that a cashier asks a customer. Cashiers can select the appropriate response, or subcode, on the POS register. For example, when a customer purchases a particular product, an info code can prompt the cashier to ask whether the customer wants to purchase a related product. Subcodes can provide the “Yes” and “No” responses. If the cashier selects “Yes,” the related product is added to the transaction.

The topics in this section provide information about how to set up info codes and subcodes.
