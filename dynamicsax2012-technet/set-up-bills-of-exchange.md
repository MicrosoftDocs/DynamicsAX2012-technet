# Set up bills of exchange 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A bill of exchange is a written or electronic order from a customer specifying that another party, usually a bank, should pay a stated amount to the company.

When you use a bill of exchange as payment for a sales order invoice or free text invoice, you credit the customer account. That credit is secured by the bill of exchange until the customer pays the bill of exchange to the bank. You will typically settle the invoice with the bill of exchange on the due date. When you receive notification from your bank that the bill of exchange has been honored, you can close the bill of exchange. In Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can use journals to manage bills of exchange.

You can draw the bill of exchange through your bank at either of the following times:

  - On the due date. This is known as *remit for collection*.

  - Before the due date, typically on the discount date specified by the terms of payment that are set up for the customer. When you post the transaction, the discount amount is posted to an expense account. The remaining amount is a liability to you until the bank receives payment from the customer. This is known as *remit for discount*.

## Set up posting profiles for bills of exchange

Use the **Customer posting profiles** form to set up posting profiles to use with bills of exchange, protest bills of exchange, remittances for collection, and remittances for discount:

  - **Bill of exchange** – Use when posting bills of exchange automatically when invoices are settled or when manually posting bills of exchange that are entered in the **Journals** form. To open the **Journals** form, click the **Draw bill of exchange journal** or **Redraw bill of exchange journal** menu item.

  - **Protest bill of exchange** – Use when posting protested bills of exchange automatically or when posting protested bills of exchange that are entered in the **Journals** form. To open the **Journals** form, click the **Protest bill of exchange journal** menu item.

## Set up payment fees for bills of exchange

A payment fee is a charge that is associated with the process of collecting payments from customers. Each payment fee can have multiple payment fee setup lines associated with it. Use setup lines to control how default amounts for payment fees are calculated. For example, you can create setup lines for methods of payment, payment specifications, currencies, and time periods. You can also create setup lines for a percentage or amount based on day intervals, such as an interest percentage based on the length of time a payment is overdue. If the bank charges different fees for different remittance types, such as **Collection** or **Discount**, set up a separate payment fee line for each remittance type.

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Payment** \> **Payment fee**.

2.  Create a new payment fee. For more information, see [Customer payment fee (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa616532\(v=ax.60\)).

9.  Repeat steps 2 through 8 to set up additional payment fees, if necessary.

## Set up remittance fees for bank remittance files

1.  Click **Cash and bank management** \> **Common** \> **Bank accounts**.
