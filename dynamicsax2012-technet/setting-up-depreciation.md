# Setting up depreciation 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Depreciation books are used for reporting asset information for tax and other non-financial reporting. For example, you can create a book for corporate reporting, earnings and profits, federal taxes, alternative minimum tax, state tax, or for any other of your legal entityâ€™s accounting needs. You can set up an unlimited number of books for each legal entity.

You can select default entries for information, such as the depreciation method and the switchover method. You can change any of the information in the **Fixed asset group/depreciation book** form or the **Fixed assets/depreciation books** form.

These tax books, or depreciation books, do not affect the general ledger because information that is tracked in the depreciation books is used only for tax or other non-financial purposes. You can continue to associate a value model with the current posting layer and consider this book the corporate book.
