## Apply CU6 to CHN environments

This section provides China-specific information needed to install CU6 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 as a part of upgrade from the following Microsoft Dynamics AX versions and configurations:

  - Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009 GLS with Chinese tax integration

  - Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 with Chinese tax integration

  - Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 with CU1 and Chinese tax integration

On systems with tax integration for China, you must export external invoices before you upgrade from Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009 GLS or install updates to Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2. Unless you do this, jobs related to the updateExternalInvoice\_CN class will fail during data upgrade postsynchronization and block other jobs from continuing.

Two solutions are available:

**Solution 1:** Export the external invoices manually before installing CU6.

1.  In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, click **Accounts receivable** \> **Periodic** \> **Export to file**.

2.  In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2: Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Periodic** \> **Tax integration** \> **Export to file**.

**Solution 2:** If you upgraded without exporting the external invoices and encountered an error stating that all invoices are not exported, you can manually run the TaxExportInvoiceTaxIntegration\_CN class to export all the remaining external invoices. Then rerun the data upgrade.

For additional troubleshooting information, see [(CHN) Chinese tax integration for VAT customer invoices](chn-chinese-tax-integration-for-vat-customer-invoices.md) and [(CHN) Configure tax integration](chn-configure-tax-integration.md).
