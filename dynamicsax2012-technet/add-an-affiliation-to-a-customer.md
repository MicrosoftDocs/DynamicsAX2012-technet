# Add an affiliation to a customer 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to add an affiliation to a retail customer record so that when a cashier adds the customer to a transaction, the affiliation and its discount are automatically added to the transaction. An affiliation identifies customers who are members of a group, or are associated with one, for example, seniors or students.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Before you can add affiliations to customer records, you must set up affiliations and their discounts. For more information, see <A href="set-up-an-affiliation-and-its-discounts.md">Set up an affiliation and its discounts</A>.</P>



To add an affiliation to a customer account, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Customers** \> **All customers**.

2.  On the **All customers** list page, double-click a customer.

3.  In the **Customers** form, on the **Action Pane**, on the **Retail** tab, in the **Related information** group, click **Affiliations**.

4.  In the **Affiliations** form, in the **Name** column, select an affiliation.

5.  If the customer has more than one affiliation, click **New**, and then, in the **Name** column, select another affiliation.
