# Install Commerce Data Exchange: Async Client 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

Commerce Data Exchange: Async Client is part of the asynchronous system that shares data between the Microsoft Dynamics AX database and channel databases. Async Client is installed at the channel and communicates with the channel database. In addition to Async Client, Commerce Data Exchange includes Commerce Data Exchange: Async Server. Async Server is installed at headquarters and communicates with the Microsoft Dynamics AX database.

When you install Async Client, the Retail Salt Utility is also installed. The Retail Salt Utility provides extra encryption for the passwords and credentials that are associated with the Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 for Retail system.

The Async Client Configuration Tool is also installed together with Async Client. This tool lets you test connections and specify whether to use streaming. The streaming option is ideal for initial high-speed data synchronization. However, for ongoing synchronization, the non-streaming option is more reliable. For more information, see [Configure settings for Async Client](configure-settings-for-async-client.md).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Async Client is available only with Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3.</P>



To deploy Async Client on multiple computers in an environment, you can use the Retail mass deployment toolkit to deploy Async Client from a central location. For more information, see [Mass deploy Retail components by using System Center Configuration Manager](mass-deploy-retail-components-by-using-system-center-configuration-manager.md).

## Before you install Async Client

  - Determine how many instances of Async Client you want to install, and on which computers.
    
    In a basic deployment of Retail, one instance of Async Client is installed for each channel database. If you want to install more than one instance of Async Client on a single computer, you must run the Windows PowerShell installation scripts manually for subsequent installations. For more information, see Install Async Client by using Windows PowerShell.

  - Select a service account for Async Client. For information about the requirements for service accounts, see [Create service accounts](create-service-accounts.md).

  - Create the channel database that will be used with this instance of Async Client. When you install a channel database, the groups that have permissions on the database are created. During the Async Client installation, the service user is added to this group. For more information, see [Install a Retail channel database](install-a-retail-channel-database.md).

  - On the computer where you plan to install this component, run the prerequisite validation utility to verify that system requirements have been met. For information about how to run the prerequisite validation utility, see [Check prerequisites](check-prerequisites.md).
    
    For more information about the hardware and software requirements for Microsoft Dynamics AX, see the [system requirements](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=165377).

  - The SQLCMD utility is required to install Async Client. This utility is typically installed with Microsoft SQL Server. If a version of SQL Server is not installed on the computer where you install Async Client, you can download and install [Microsoft Command Line Utilities 11 for SQL Server](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36433) to meet this requirement.

## Option 1: Install Async Client by using Setup

Use this procedure to install Async Client by using the Setup wizard. If you install other Microsoft Dynamics AX components at the same time, the installation pages vary, depending on the components that you are installing.

1.  Start Microsoft Dynamics AX Setup. Under **Install**, select **Microsoft Dynamics AX components**.

2.  Advance through the first wizard pages.

3.  If the Setup Support files have not yet been installed on this computer, the **Select a file location** page is displayed. The Setup Support files are required for installation. Provide a file location or accept the default location, and then click **Next**. On the **Ready to install** page, click **Install**.

4.  On the **Select an installation option** page, click **Microsoft Dynamics AX**.

5.  On the **Select installation type** page, click **Custom installation**, and then click **Next**.

6.  On the **Select components** page, select **Async Client**, and then click **Next**.

7.  On the **Prerequisite validation results** page, resolve any errors. For more information about how to resolve prerequisite errors, see [Check prerequisites](check-prerequisites.md). When no errors remain, click **Next**.

8.  On the **Configure Async Client** page, select the check box to configure Async Client by using Setup. If you clear this check box, the application files are installed, but Async Client is not configured.
    
    If you’re configuring Async Client, enter the following information:
    
      - **Async Server URL** – The URL for the instance of Async Server. Typically, the URL is in the format https://\<server name\>:port/\<web application name\>.
        
        If Async Server is installed in a cluster that has a load balancer, enter the URL to the service on the load balancer.
    
      - **Channel database ID** – The identifier in Microsoft Dynamics AX for the channel database that is used by the selected instance of Async Client.
    
      - **User name** and **Password** (Async Server connection) – The credentials for the user that connects to Async Server. These credentials must match the credentials that are specified in the channel database profile. Credentials are case sensitive. The credentials are used to identify and authenticate Async Client.
    
      - **User name** and **Password** (Async Client) – The credentials for the user that runs the Windows service for Async Client. The user does not have to be a domain account. The user can be a member of a workgroup on the local computer. Credentials are case sensitive.
    
    Optionally, click **Test connection** to verify that Async Client is configured correctly. For information about how to troubleshoot errors that you might encounter, see [Troubleshoot issues in Async Server or Async Client](troubleshoot-issues-in-async-server-or-async-client.md).
    
    Click **Next**.

9.  On the **Select or specify a database to use with Async Client** page, enter server and database information for the message database and the channel database that will be used by Async Client. Then click **Next**.
    
    You can connect to an existing channel database only. Setup does not create a new channel database if you enter a channel database name that doesn’t exist. If you specify a message database name that doesn’t exist, Setup creates a new message database.

10. On the **Prerequisite validation results** page, resolve any errors. For more information about how to resolve prerequisite errors, see [Check prerequisites](check-prerequisites.md). When no errors remain, click **Next**.

11. On the **Ready to install** page, click **Install**.

12. After the installation is completed, click **Finish** to close the wizard.

## Option 2: Install Async Client by using Windows PowerShell

Use this procedure to install Async Client manually by using Windows PowerShell. To install multiple instances of Async Client on the same computer, you must use a manual installation. Manual installations are often performed by businesses and organizations that automate deployments by using scripts.

After you extract the installation files by using Setup, you must configure settings in the sc-settings.xml file.

1.  Open the folder where the Windows PowerShell scripts are installed. By default, the files are located at C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Dynamics AX\\60\\CDX\\Async Client\\Tools.

2.  Create a copy of the sc-settings.xml file for each instance of Async Client that you plan to deploy. We recommend that you not change the original file.

3.  Open your copy of the sc-settings.xml file in Microsoft Visual Studio or a text editor, such as Notepad.

4.  Enter a value for the following parameters.

### ![Dn741220.collapse\_all(en-us,AX.60).gif](images/Gg841655.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif "Dn741220.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif")Run Windows PowerShell scripts to configure Async Client

After you configure the parameters in the sc-settings.xml file, you can run the Windows PowerShell scripts that configure Async Client.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Windows PowerShell includes a security setting called the execution policy that determines how scripts are run. By default, the execution policy is set to <STRONG>Restricted</STRONG>, which prevents any scripts from running. To run the installation scripts for Microsoft Dynamics AX components, we recommend that you set the execution policy to <STRONG>RemoteSigned</STRONG> by using Set-ExecutionPolicy cmdlet. This setting allows you to run scripts that you’ve written and scripts that have been signed by a trusted publisher.</P>



1.  On the server where you want to run the script, open Windows PowerShell to the folder where the scripts are installed. By default, the files are located at C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Dynamics AX\\60\\CDX\\Async Client\\Tools.
    
      - If you’re using Windows Server 2012 or a later operating system, use Windows Explorer to open the folder where the scripts are installed. Then click **File** \> **Open Windows PowerShell** \> **Open Windows PowerShell as administrator**.
    
      - If you’re using Windows Server 2008 R2 or an earlier operating system, start Windows PowerShell as the administrator. Then, change the directory by using the following command: CD "\<Path to directory\>".

2.  In the Windows PowerShell console, run the following command to create a Windows PowerShell credential object on the local computer for the application pool identity.
    
    ``` powershell
    $Cred = @((New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('domain\username',(ConvertTo-SecureString 'password' -AsPlainText -Force))))
    ```
    
    For more information about how to create credential objects, see [Create Windows PowerShell Scripts that Accept Credentials](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=394381).

3.  Run the following command to create a credential object for the account that is used to connect to Async Server.
    
    ``` powershell
    $Cred += @((New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('domain\username',(ConvertTo-SecureString 'password' -AsPlainText -Force))))
    ```

4.  Run the following command to deploy Async Client.
    
    ``` powershell
    .\DeployAsyncClient.ps1 -SettingsXmlFilePath <path> -TopologyXmlFilePath <path> -Credentials $Cred –Verbose $true
    ```
    
    Example:
    
    .\\DeployAsyncClient.ps1 -SettingsXmlFilePath “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Dynamics AX\\60\\CDX\\Async Client\\Tools\\sc-settings.xm” -TopologyXmlFilePath “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Dynamics AX\\60\\CDX\\Async Client\\Tools\\sc-topology.xml” -Credentials $Cred –Verbose $true

## After you install Async Client

1.  Use the Async Client Configuration Tool to test the connections to Async Server, the channel database, and the channel message database. You can also use the utility to set advanced options. For more information, see [Configure settings for Async Client](configure-settings-for-async-client.md).

2.  After you have determined that all connections are working, run the distribution schedule that sends data to each channel database. Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Retail scheduler** \> **Channel integration** \> **Channel database**. Click **Full data sync**, and then select the **Full sync** distribution schedule.
