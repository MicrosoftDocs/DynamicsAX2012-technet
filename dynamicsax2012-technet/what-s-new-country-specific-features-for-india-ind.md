# What's new: Country-specific features for India (IND) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, we changed and added country-specific functionality for India. This topic is divided into two sections. The first section outlines the key features that have a broad impact on Indian installations, such as features that affect export/import (EXIM) incentive schemes, taxation, invoicing, general ledger, and fixed assets. The second section describes additional changes to country-specific functionality for India. For more information about specific features for India, see [TechNet Library for Application Users - India](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=299913).

## New functionality

The Government of India offers many special incentive schemes to Indian importers. These schemes are mostly available for imported products that are used to manufacture export goods. You have more flexibility when you post and report import and export activity and the related customs duty taxes.

You can set up tax numbers and other details to track and report transactions that contain Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) and Tax Collected at Source (TCS) by financial dimension and by legal entity.

Create free text invoices to record purchases that are not related to a purchase order. Add free text lines to an invoice that was created from a purchase order. You can add direct and indirect taxes to free text lines. You can also make corrections to import and export transaction documents, such as sales orders, instead of canceling the transaction and then recreating the document for the transaction.

By using the subledger journal in AX 2012 R2, you can review transactions before you post them. You can also create additional financial dimensions to allocate costs more effectively.

Transfer fixed assets to multiple legal entities and financial dimensions. You can track fixed asset transfers and report them to your local authority.

## Comparison with Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009

These features have changed considerably since AX 2009. AX 2012 R2 includes changes to the following areas:

  - EXIM incentive schemes

  - Taxation

  - Invoicing

  - General ledger

  - Fixed assets

<td><p>Depreciation calculation for India</p></td>
<td><p>In accordance with the Indian companies act, depreciation of assets is calculated based on the number of days in a period, the type of industry, and the type of shift. You can calculate depreciation of assets based on the number of days that the asset is used by using the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>Straight line percentage</strong> method</p></li>
<li><p>The written down value method (or the <strong>Reducing balance</strong> method)</p></li>
<li><p>The monthly depreciation that is calculated based on the actual number of days in a month</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For India, a straight line percentage method has been added. The <strong>Straight line percentage</strong> depreciation method. Depreciation is calculated by using the number of days, and is displayed in the <strong>Depreciation profiles</strong> form for a value model for the selected depreciation method and calendar type. If you select the reducing balance method as a value model for the current layer, you can use both the standard depreciation calculation process and the day-based depreciation calculation process. You can attach either a standard calendar or a day-based calendar when the depreciation profile uses the reducing balance method.</p>
<p>Depreciation for seasonal and non-seasonal industries is calculated by using the <strong>Min. working days for seasonal industries</strong> parameter. The following factors are considered when shift depreciation is calculated:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The type of shift and industry.</p></li>
<li><p>The rate of shift depreciation.</p></li>
<li><p>The posting layer for the value model record must be <strong>Current</strong>, and the calendar type must be <strong>Day based</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The calculated shift depreciation for the value model is displayed separately for each type of shift. For single-shift depreciation, the calendar type should be <strong>Day based</strong> for a value model for the current layer, and the depreciation method is <strong>Straight line percentage</strong> or <strong>Reducing balance</strong> method.</p>

The validity period for the import of capital goods under a 0 (zero) percent EPCG scheme is nine months. You can extend the export obligation period for two years one time, and this extension is subject to specific conditions. The export obligation is equivalent to six times the duty that is saved on the capital goods that are imported under the EPCG scheme, and the export obligation must be fulfilled in six years from the issue date of the authorization.</p>
<p>A concessional 3-percent duty EPCG scheme allows for an export obligation that is equivalent to eight times the duty that is saved on capital goods that are imported under the EPCG scheme, and the export obligation must be fulfilled in eight years. For EPCG authorizations that have a duty saved amount of INR 100 crores or more, the export obligation can be fulfilled over a period of 12 years.</p>
<p>Companies that operate under the Board for Industrial &amp; Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) and units in Agricultural Export zones are also granted 12 years to fulfill their export obligations. Merchant exporters can import capital goods under the EPCG scheme if the capital goods are installed in the factory of the supporting manufacturer who is endorsed on the license. An EPCG authorization holder can also obtain machinery and equipment from India, and the Indian manufacturer can import components for the machinery at a concessional rate of either 0 percent or 3 percent. However, the license holder, not the manufacturer, is responsible for meeting the export obligation.</p>

When an individual asset is associated with a block of assets, which is identified as a fixed asset group in Microsoft Dynamics AX, the individual asset loses its identity and is merged with the asset group value. Depreciation is applied on the value of the whole fixed asset group and is not calculated on individual asset values.</p>
<p>The system cannot identify the depreciation value and net book value for an individual fixed asset that is being transferred, if that asset is associated with a fixed asset group value model for which asset group depreciation applies.

These inputs must be used to manufacture standardized exportable products. Licenses that are issued under the Duty Exemption Scheme are based on SION. For example, licenses for some incentive schemes, such as the Advance Authorization (AA) and Duty Free Import Authorization (DFIA), are issued only for products that are contained in the SION table.</p>

<td><p>Tax thresholds and tax concession certificates for India</p></td>
<td><p>You can set up and apply threshold limits on customer and vendor transactions. You can set up threshold limits for direct taxes in India and then specify the tax rates for each threshold limit. You can also set up a tax concession certificate for a customer or a vendor. Microsoft Dynamics AX calculates direct taxes on transactions, based on the threshold segments that you specify. You can apply the following types of threshold limits on transactions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cumulative threshold</strong> – The maximum limit of a cumulative transaction value, beyond which direct tax on the transaction value is applied.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transaction threshold</strong> – The maximum limit of an individual transaction value, beyond which direct tax on the transaction value is applied.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transaction line threshold</strong> – The maximum limit of a transaction line value, beyond which direct tax on the transaction line value is applied.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Follow these steps to set up and use threshold limits:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Set up threshold limits by setting up a threshold definition and designing a threshold hierarchy.</p></li>
<li><p>Assign thresholds to a withholding tax code, and set up tax values to apply to the final level of each threshold segment in the threshold hierarchy.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up a tax concession certificate for a customer or a vendor, if a certificate is required.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up a withholding tax group that contains the withholding tax code to which you assigned the threshold and the threshold values.</p></li>
<li><p>Create and post transactions that use the withholding tax group for the withholding tax code to which you assigned the threshold and threshold values.</p></li>

<td><p>Use the sales tax hierarchy to process sales tax settlements, sales tax payments, and sales tax returns.</p></td>
<td><p>You can use the sales tax hierarchy to set off taxes, and you can then generate reports. A sales tax hierarchy is a hierarchical structure that can contain multiple levels of various components, such as service codes, tax codes, and tax components. You can set up a sales tax hierarchy based on your business requirements, and then use this sales tax hierarchy to process sales tax settlements, sales tax payments, and sales tax returns.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to set up and use the sales tax hierarchy:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Set up the parameter to use the sales tax hierarchy.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up a sales tax hierarchy, based on the structure of the hierarchy. You can maintain multiple versions of the sales tax hierarchy. The levels of the hierarchy are determined by the structure. For example, a sales tax hierarchy that is used to set off excise duty has three levels: tax type, tax component, and tax record type. To modify the structure based on your business requirements, you can use the sales tax hierarchy framework.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up and maintain a sales tax hierarchy profile. You can create multiple hierarchy profiles and versions that are set off based on your business requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a tax setoff rule that is used to set off the output tax by using the input tax.</p></li>
<li><p>Settle a sales tax transaction by using the sales tax hierarchy, and then generate a sales tax payment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You can view the details of the settled taxes for each tax component in the <strong>Payment journal</strong> form.</p>
