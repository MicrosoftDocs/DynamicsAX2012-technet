# (BRA) Post an NF-e from a project invoice 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can create and post a project invoice to generate a nota fiscal eletrônica (NF-e). When you post a project invoice, an NF-e XML file is generated and submitted to the Secretaria da Fazenda (SEFAZ).

Before you can generate the NF-e, you must assign a fiscal document type for the NF-e to the fiscal establishment that is related to the primary address of the legal entity. For more information, see [(BRA) Assign fiscal document types for customers or vendors](bra-assign-fiscal-document-types-for-customers-or-vendors.md).

After the status of the NF-e is received from SEFAZ, you can perform the following tasks:

  - If the NF-e is approved, you can print the Documento Auxiliar da Nota Fiscal Eletrônica (DANFE), or the DANFE is printed automatically if you select the **Print DANFE when NF-e is approved** check box on the **NF-e federal** FastTab in the **Fiscal establishments** form. For more information, see [(BRA) Set up NF-e parameters for a fiscal establishment](bra-set-up-nf-e-parameters-for-a-fiscal-establishment.md).

  - If the NF-e is denied, then you must cancel the NF-e. For more information, see [(BRA) Cancel a project invoice NF-e](bra-cancel-a-project-invoice-nf-e.md).

  - If the NF-e is rejected and can be fixed, you can correct the incorrect information, and then you can click **Resend** on the **NF-e federal** tab on the **Action Pane** in the **Fiscal document** form to resend the NF-e to SEFAZ.

  - If the NF-e is rejected and not fixable, you must cancel the NF-e.
