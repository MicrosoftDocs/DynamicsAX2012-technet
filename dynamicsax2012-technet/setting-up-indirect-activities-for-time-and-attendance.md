The following topics provide information about how to set up indirect activities. Indirect activities are used for various types of registrations in **Time and attendance**.

The main purpose of indirect activities is to set up specific tasks for registering costs on activities that are not directly related to production orders or projects. Indirect activities include, for example, staff meetings, participation in courses or seminars, and machine repair.
