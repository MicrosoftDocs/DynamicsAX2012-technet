# What's new: Code Upgrade Service for Microsoft Dynamics AX 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The Code Upgrade Tool for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 (Beta) is designed to help Microsoft Dynamics AX developers upgrade their X++ code to AX 2012. The tool analyzes X++ code patterns. The tool then automatically fixes some patterns, provides suggestions for how to fix other patterns, and categorizes upgrade tasks. Developers can also add their own patterns for analysis.

As of November, 2014, the Code Upgrade Tool has been moved. It is now available from the Downloadable tools section of Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services.
