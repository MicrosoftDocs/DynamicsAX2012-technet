# (CZE) About intra-community VAT 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can calculate and post information about intra-community value-added tax (VAT) automatically. When you post a European Union (EU) vendor invoice, two VAT transactions of the same amount are created. One VAT transaction is created for payable sales tax, and one is created for receivable sales tax.

To enable intra-community VAT, do the following:

  - In the **Accounts payable parameters** form, in the left pane, click **Ledger and sales tax**, and then, on the **Sales tax** FastTab, select the **Intra-community VAT** check box.
