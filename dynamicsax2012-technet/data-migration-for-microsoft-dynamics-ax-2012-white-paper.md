# Data Migration for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 (White paper) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 includes various ways to import data into the system. Because the Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 data model was normalized, choosing an import method can be challenging.

This white paper has been retired. Instead, please refer to [Plan data import, export, and migration](plan-data-import-export-and-migration.md).
