# Create locations 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use this wizard to set up locations for a warehouse. You can select a warehouse and define the locations. You can use the wizard to set up as many locations, as needed.

Microsoft Dynamics AX verifies that setup is complete for the selected warehouse, and marks any areas that are not set up. You can also select or clear a check box to mark any areas where additional setup is needed. The wizard skips over any unmarked areas.

1.  Click **Inventory management** \> **Setup** \> **Inventory breakdown** \> **Warehouses**.

2.  Click **Functions**, and then select **Location Wizard**.

3.  Click **Next \>** to move forward in the wizard, and enter the appropriate information on each page.
    
    To return to a previous page, click **\< Back**.
    
    To exit the wizard at any time, click **Cancel**. The ESC key also cancels the wizard.

4.  To complete the update, click **Cancel**.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you exit the wizard by canceling, it will not return to the same page when you start it again.</P>
