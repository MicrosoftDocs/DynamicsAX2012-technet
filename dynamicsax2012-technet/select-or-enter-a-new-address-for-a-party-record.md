# Select or enter a new address for a party record 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The party records that are stored in the Microsoft Dynamics AX global address book can contain one or more address records. These addresses are used for different purposes, such as billing or delivery. In a source or business document, you might have to select a different address from the default address – for example, when you are shipping an item to a customer at an alternate address. Or, you might have to add a new address for a party – for example, when an employee moves or a contact changes organizations.

These procedures explain how to select a different address for a party record and how to enter a new address.

## Update an address for a party record

1.  Open the party record for which you want to select an address.

2.  On the **Addresses** FastTab, select the address to update, and then click **Edit**.

3.  In the **Edit address** form, make the necessary changes to the address or address parameters.
    
    For example, if you are selecting a new delivery address, after you have selected the address in the list, in the **Purpose** field, select **Delivery**. This address is now categorized as an address to be used for delivery.
    
    Or, you might have to set a new primary address. After you select the address to update, on the **Address** FastTab, select the **Primary** check box.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>To update more than one address in the party record, on the <STRONG>Addresses</STRONG> FastTab, click <STRONG>More options</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Advanced</STRONG>, and then make changes in the <STRONG>Advanced</STRONG> form.</P>



## Enter a new address for a party record

1.  Open the party record to which you want to add an address.

2.  On the **Addresses** FastTab, click **Add**.

3.  In the **New address** form, enter a name and a description of the address and select the address purpose.
    
    The name that you enter for the address should be the name of a person or an organization. This name is used as the default name for the address in source documents and business documents.

4.  Enter the address components and any other necessary information.

The new address will be available when you are working with the party record.
