_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

If unsettled payment documents remain at the end of reporting period, the payment documents must be converted to prepayments and included in the sales book. You can also convert a payment into a prepayment by using the **Customer transactions** form.
