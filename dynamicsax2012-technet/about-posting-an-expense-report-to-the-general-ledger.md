# About posting an expense report to the general ledger 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

After an expense report has been approved and transferred to the general journal, the report can be posted to the general ledger. When you post an expense report, expenses that are eligible for Value Added Tax (VAT) recovery are identified. The task of verifying and recovering VAT payments is assigned to the employee who is responsible for verifying the expense report.

If an expense report contains expenses that are charged to a company other than the company that employs the employee, you must verify which company the expense is owed to and which company the expense is owed from. For example, if the employee who submitted the expense report works for company DAT but charged an expense to company DIR, DAT is the owed-to company and DIR is the owed-from company. After you verify these journal lines, you can post the expense lines to the general ledger.

To post an expense report:

  - Click **Travel and expense** \> **Common** \> **Expense reports** \> **Approved expense reports**. Select the expense report that you want to post, and on the **Action Pane**, click **Post** \> **Selected**.
    
    You can approve all of the expense reports in the list by clicking **Post** \> **All**.
