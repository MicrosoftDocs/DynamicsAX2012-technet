1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Sales orders** \> **All sales orders**.

2.  Select a sales order and then on the **Action Pane**, on the **Sell** tab, in the **Create** group, click **Credit note** to create a credit note.

3.  Iin the **Create credit note** form, select the **Select all** check box to select all transactions for credit note creation.

4.  Select the **Tax as per original invoice** check box to apply the tax rate for service tax on the date when the original order was invoiced.

5.  Select the **Mark** check box to select individual transactions to include in the credit note.
