# Set up business justification codes 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can define business justification reason codes to classify and track certain types of purchases. For example, you can create codes to signify that a purchase was made for a new hire, a scheduled replacement, equipment failure, a marketing event, or other defined reason. Because business justification codes appear on purchase requisitions, anyone reviewing a purchase requisition can immediately see the reason for a purchase.

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Setup** \> **Policies** \> **Business justifications**.

2.  In the **Business justifications** form, click the **New** button or press CTRL+N to add a new business justification reason code.

3.  In the **Business justification** field, enter the business justification reason code that you want requesters to use when they enter a purchase request. The business justification reason code appears in a drop-down list on the purchase requisition header.

4.  In the **Description** field, enter the description that you want to appear in the **Reason** field on the purchase requisition header.

5.  Repeat steps 2 through 4 to add additional business justification codes.
