# (RUS) Non-linear tax accounting group depreciation method 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Linear and non-linear depreciation methods are used to calculate depreciation for tax accounting. The linear method that is used in tax accounting corresponds to the linear method that is used in standard accounting.

When the non-linear method is used, the accrued monthly depreciation for the asset is calculated as the product of the remaining value of the asset and the depreciation rate. The depreciation rate is defined by the formula K = (2/n) \* 100%, where n = the useful life of the asset in months.
