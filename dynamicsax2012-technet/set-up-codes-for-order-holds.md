# Set up codes for order holds 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

During the sales process, there are times when a sales order must be placed on hold. When a sales order is placed on hold, an order hold code is assigned to the sales order to indicate the reason for the hold. For example, a sales order might be placed on hold because of issues with a customer payment, fraud, or to wait for review by a manager. This topic explains how to set up order hold codes.

To set up codes for order holds, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Setup** \> **Sales orders** \> **Order hold codes**.

2.  In the **Order hold codes** form, click **New**, and in the **Hold code** field, enter the name of the code.

3.  In the **Description** field, enter a description or explanation of the code.

4.  On the **General** FastTab, in the **Role** field, select the security role that can use the hold code.

5.  If this hold code should be automatically placed on all new sales order holds, select the **Default for sales order** check box.

6.  In the **Hold code color** field, select the color that will be applied to the hold code.

7.  If the inventory reservations on a sales order should be removed when the hold code is applied, select the **Remove inventory reservations** check box.
