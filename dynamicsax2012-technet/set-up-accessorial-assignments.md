# Set up accessorial assignments 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

You can associate a shipping carrier with one or more accessorial assignments for surcharges, such as fuel surcharges. When you rate a shipment, you can calculate accessorial charges and assign those charges to freight transportation services.

## Set up an accessorial assignment

You can set up an accessorial assignment with an optional detail level. For example, you can set filtering options that limit the accessorial assignment to apply for a specific warehouse during a specific period.

To set up an accessorial assignment, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Transportation management** \> **Setup** \> **Rating** \> **Accessorial assignments**.

2.  On the **Details** FastTab, in the **Name** field, enter a descriptive name for the accessorial assignment.

3.  In the **Carrier accessorial ID** field, select an ID to associate information such as shipping carrier, carrier service, and billing group. For more information, see “Set up a carrier accessorial” in [Set up accessorial charges for a shipping carrier](set-up-accessorial-charges-for-a-shipping-carrier.md).

4.  On the **Criteria** FastTab, select the **Always apply** check box if you want to always calculate fuel surcharges for the selected accessorial fee type with the current set of filter criteria.

5.  On the **Calculation** FastTab, in the **Accessorial fee type** field, select the type of accessorial fee to use to rate freight. The fields on the **Calculation** FastTab change depending on the selection in this field.
    
    The available options for the accessorial fee type are described in the following table.
