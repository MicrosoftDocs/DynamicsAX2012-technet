# (LTU) Enter details for a fixed asset repair statement 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

When the repair cost for a fixed asset exceeds 50 percent of the fixed assetâ€™s acquisition value, the net balance value of the asset increases by the repair amount. Repair information must be stored for all fixed assets. You can generate and print a report that includes information about the fixed asset repair.

1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Common** \> **Fixed assets** \> **Fixed assets**.

2.  Select the fixed asset, and then, on the **Action Pane**, click **Value models**.

3.  Select the value model for the fixed asset, and then click **Repair fixed assets**.

4.  In the **Repair** form, in the **Date of repair** field, enter the date on which the fixed asset was repaired. In the **Description** field, enter a brief description of the repair.

5.  In the **Amount spent for repair** field, enter the cost of the repair.

6.  In the **Document number** field, enter the number that is assigned to the document that was generated for the repair.

7.  Click **Totals**.

8.  In the **Amount spent for repair** form, in the **Fiscal year** field, select the fiscal year from which to calculate the repair amount. Or, in the **From date** and **To date** fields, select the start date and end date of the period that is used to calculate the repair amount.
