_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

When the repair cost for a fixed asset exceeds 50 percent of the fixed asset’s acquisition value, the net balance value of the asset increases by the repair amount. Repair information must be stored for all fixed assets. You can generate and print a report that includes information about the fixed asset repair.

1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Common** \> **Fixed assets** \> **Fixed assets**.

2.  Select the fixed asset, and then, on the **Action Pane**, click **Value models**.

3.  Select the value model for the fixed asset, and then click **Repair fixed assets**.

4.  In the **Repair** form, in the **Date of repair** field, enter the date on which the fixed asset was repaired. In the **Description** field, enter a brief description of the repair.

5.  In the **Amount spent for repair** field, enter the cost of the repair.

6.  In the **Document number** field, enter the number that is assigned to the document that was generated for the repair.

7.  Click **Totals**.

8.  In the **Amount spent for repair** form, in the **Fiscal year** field, select the fiscal year from which to calculate the repair amount. Or, in the **From date** and **To date** fields, select the start date and end date of the period that is used to calculate the repair amount.
