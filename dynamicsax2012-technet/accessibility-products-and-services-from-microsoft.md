## Accessibility features of Windows

The Windows operating system has many built-in accessibility features that are useful for individuals who have difficulty typing or using a mouse, are blind or have low vision, or are deaf or hard-of-hearing. The features are installed during Setup. For more information about these features, see Help in Windows and the [Microsoft Accessibility Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=86482).

## Free step-by-step tutorials

Microsoft offers a series of step-by-step tutorials that provide detailed procedures for adjusting the accessibility options and settings on the computer. This information is presented in a side-by-side format so that you can learn how to use the mouse, the keyboard, or a combination of both.

To find step-by-step tutorials for Microsoft products, see the [Microsoft Accessibility Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=86482).

## Assistive technology products for Windows

A wide variety of assistive technology products is available to make computers easier to use for people with disabilities. You can search a catalog of assistive technology products that run on Windows at the [Microsoft Accessibility Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=86482).

If you use assistive technology, make sure that you contact your assistive technology vendor before you upgrade your software or hardware to check for possible compatibility issues.
