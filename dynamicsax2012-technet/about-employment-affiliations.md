# About employment affiliations 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

An employment affiliation is a work relationship between a legal entity and a worker. When you hire a person, and subsequently create a worker record for that person, you must specify the legal entity that the person will have an employment affiliation with.

A worker cannot have more than one employment affiliation with the same legal entity at the same time. However, a worker can have employment affiliations with multiple legal entities.
