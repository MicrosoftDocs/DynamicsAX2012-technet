# (CHN) About accounting distributions and subledger journals 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Before you post a purchase order or a free text invoice, you can view the full accounting entry of the invoice, which includes debits and credits, to verify that the invoice is being posted to the correct accounts. This view of the full accounting entry is called a subledger journal. Subledger journal lines are accounting entries that are available from the advanced ledger entries in **General ledger**. You can view the subledger posting type and ledger lines for an accounting event. You can create subledger journals from source documents, such as invoices, packing slips, and picking lists for customers and vendors.

Before you post the voucher transactions for an advanced ledger entry, you can edit subledger journals by using the distribution method. This method allows you to allocate posting amounts among multiple financial dimensions and change the default ledger account number or financial dimension value based on user permissions. For more information, see [About accounting distributions and subledger journal entries for purchase orders](about-accounting-distributions-and-subledger-journal-entries-for-purchase-orders.md), [About accounting distributions and subledger journal entries for free text invoices](about-accounting-distributions-and-subledger-journal-entries-for-free-text-invoices.md), and [About accounting distributions and subledger journal entries for vendor invoices](about-accounting-distributions-and-subledger-journal-entries-for-vendor-invoices.md).

## Voucher types and voucher numbers

Voucher types are generated and validated when ledger transactions are posted. Voucher types and voucher numbers are included in ledger transactions after accounting distributions and subledger journal lines are posted. You can use ledger inquiries to query ledger transactions with voucher types and voucher. You can print ledger vouchers with voucher numbers and print financial reports with voucher types and voucher numbers in the **General ledger**, **Accounts payable**, **Accounts receivable**, and **Inventory and warehouse management**. For more information, see [(CHN) Copy and reverse a voucher](chn-copy-and-reverse-a-voucher.md).
