# (IND) Create tax groups for service tax 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can create and manage sales tax groups that determine the calculation of service tax. For example, for a vendor or a customer, you can create a sales tax group that includes tax codes for service tax, E-cess, or SHE-cess. You can then attach the sales tax groups to service tax codes.

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **Sales tax** \> **Sales tax groups**.

2.  Click **New**, and then, in the **Sales tax group** field, enter a unique identifier for the service tax group.

3.  Enter a description of the sales tax group.

4.  On the **General** FastTab, enter any other required information.

5.  On the **Setup** FastTab, click **New**. Then, in the **Sales tax code** field, select the service tax code to attach to the service tax group.

6.  Select the **Exempt** check box to exclude the sales tax from calculations. Then, in the **Exempt code** field, select the exempt code that justifies the exclusion.

7.  Select the **Use tax** check box to indicate that your organization pays a use tax on items and services that a vendor purchases from it.

8.  In the **Percentage/Amount** field, enter the percentage or amount of tax that is used to calculate the service tax.

9.  Enter or select any other required information in the form.
