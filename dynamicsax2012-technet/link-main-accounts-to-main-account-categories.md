[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use main account categories, which are attributes that provide an additional classification, to classify general ledger main accounts and to define an account range to view information from a group of accounts. For more information, see [Main account categories (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh227632\(v=ax.60\)).

After you set up main account categories in the **Main account categories** form, use the **Link main accounts - account category: %1** form to link main accounts to the categories. A main account can be linked to only one category at a time.

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **Chart of accounts** \> **Main account categories**.

2.  Select the main account category to link to one or more main accounts.

3.  Click **Link main accounts** to open the **Link main accounts - account category: %1** form.

4.  You can link the main accounts to main account categories in these ways:
    
      - Select the **Linked** check box to link the main account to the main account category.
    
      - Click the **Link all** button to link all main accounts to the main account category.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>To unlink a main account from a main account category, clear the <STRONG>Linked</STRONG> check box next to the main account or click <STRONG>Unlink all</STRONG>.</P>



5.  Click **OK**.
