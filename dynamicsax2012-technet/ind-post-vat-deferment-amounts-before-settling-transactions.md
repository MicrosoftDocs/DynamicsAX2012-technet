You must post the VAT deferment amount from the VAT deferred account to the VAT recoverable account before settling amounts to the tax authorities. You can process the VAT deferment amounts only for the same tax ledger posting group, for a Tax Identification Number (TIN), for a particular tax settlement period, and for a given period range.

2.  Select the TIN of the company in the **Tax Identification Number (TIN)** field.

3.  Select the settlement period to run the presettlement for in the **Tax settlement period** field.
