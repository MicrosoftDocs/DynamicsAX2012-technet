# (CAN) Create sales tax entries for tax on rebates and self-assessments 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Companies must submit Goods and Services Tax or Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) returns to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) based on self-assessment of imported goods. If you import taxable supplies, you must assess the value of the goods, calculate the GST/HST amount due, and submit the total self-assessed amount with your tax return. You can claim any rebates to which you may be entitled from the government by filing manually.

Entries for self-assessed taxes and rebates are recorded in the vendor invoice journal and the general journal using the **Journal voucher** form. Use this procedure to record sales tax transactions for rebates or self-assessments.
