# Deprecated: (BRA) Generate the ICMS 1/48 fixed asset credit fiscal document from purchase orders 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

For Brazilian installations, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009 provides country-specific modifications that support the ICMS 1/48 fixed asset credit fiscal document from purchase orders. To have the right to credit ICMS tax on fixed assets, a company must generate this document at the end of the month.

<td><p>The ICMS 1/48 fixed asset credit fiscal document is an entrance fiscal document that is issued to generate the ICMS tax credit. The document does not affect a vendorâ€™s balance. This feature was removed from purchase orders and was replaced by the new tax fiscal document feature.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Replaced by another feature</p></td>
<td><p>Yes. This feature has been replaced by a tax fiscal document that generates fiscal documents that do not affect vendor or customer balances. Instead, the fiscal document generates tax transactions, such as the ICMS 1/48 fixed asset credit fiscal document and ICMS tax transfers between fiscal establishments.</p>
