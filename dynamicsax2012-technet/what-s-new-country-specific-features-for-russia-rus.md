# What's new: Country-specific features for Russia (RUS) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, we changed and added country-specific functionality for Russia. This topic is divided into two sections. The first section outlines the key features that have a broad impact on Russian installations. These features include changes to General ledger, Inventory management, sales and purchase agreements, customer and vendor invoicing, factures, and reporting. The second section describes additional changes to country-specific functionality for Russia. For more information about specific features for Russia, see [TechNet Library for Application Users - Russia](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=299918).

## Key features for Russia in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 and Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3

For installations in Russia, AX 2012 R2 and AX 2012 R3 provides country-specific features that support General ledger updates, fixed asset and depreciation transactions, inventory management, customer and vendor invoicing, factures, and specific requirements for tax and regulatory reporting.

## New functionality

Financial dimensions let you categorize transactions in the general ledger by department, cost center, and other user-defined categories. You can view financial dimensions and other details in the new subledger journal before you post transactions from source documents. You can also set up budget controls for advance reports.

Improved inventory features let you set up a default profile for retail product sales.

Enter details for contracts by using a sales agreement form and a purchase agreement form. You can specify a sales agreement in a customer transaction, such as a customer settlement. You can also specify a purchase agreement for a vendor transaction.

Several changes to customer invoices and vendor invoices, and to the invoice process, let you define the details to post for invoice transactions. You can add lines for categories and expenses that are not associated with purchase orders and sales orders, and allocate order lines to multiple dimensions and ledger accounts. You can also adjust taxes on invoice lines before you post an invoice.

You have more flexibility when you must create, correct, and report factures and any related value-added tax (VAT). You can also set up parameters to automatically update a facture for a retail sales invoice.

By using a new inventory balance turnover report, you can analyze inventory transactions by customer and by vendor.

## Comparison with Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009

These features have changed considerably since AX 2009. AX 2012 R2 and AX 2012 R3 include changes to the following areas:

  - General ledger updates

  - Inventory management

  - Sales and purchase agreements

  - Customer and vendor invoicing

  - Facture updates

  - Reporting

To comply with this requirement, Microsoft Dynamics AX has incorporated additional sections into the layout of the <strong>VAT declaration</strong> report to calculate the VAT amount. For export operations, you can print the <strong>VAT declaration</strong> report for all sections. The information that is available for each section is grouped by operation code. Entries from an operation code list that is controlled by the tax authority are defined for each section, based on column positions.
