    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><p>Settlement period</p></th>
    <th><p>Deadline for reporting</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>January 1 through March 31</p></td>
    <td><p>April 14</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p>April 1 through June 30</p></td>
    <td><p>July 14</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>July 1 through September 30</p></td>
    <td><p>October 14</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p>October 1 through December 31</p></td>

    </tr>
