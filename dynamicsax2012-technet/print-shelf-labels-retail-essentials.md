# Print shelf labels (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to generate and print shelf labels to put on a store rack or shelf where items are displayed or stored. A shelf label can contain information about a product, for example the product name, size, and color. However, a shelf label can’t contain the batch number, serial number, or expiration date.

You can generate shelf labels when the price or comparison price of a product has changed in a store. To do this, you must assign shelf label reports to the relevant retail products, either individually or by category. The shelf label reports provide the information that Retail essentials needs to print the labels. For more information about how to assign shelf label reports to products, see [Set up retail products (Retail essentials)](set-up-retail-products-retail-essentials.md).

You can generate shelf labels for all products or only for released products; for one product at a time or for categories of products. You can also generate shelf labels for the products that are included in a purchase order or a transfer order.

## Prerequisites

The following tasks must be completed before you can generate and print shelf labels:

  - Before you can set up printing for shelf labels, a system administrator must enable menu items for Retail essentials. For more information, see Enable label printing (Retail essentials).

  - Select options in the **Retail shared parameters** form to specify how labels should be generated for brick-and-mortar stores. (On the area page, under **Channels**, click **Setup** \> **Retail shared parameters**.) For more information about the options in this form, see [Retail shared parameters (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh580625\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Select the reports that can be used to generate labels. For more information, see the following section, “Set up shelf label reports.”

## Set up shelf label reports

Before you print shelf labels, you must select the reports that can be used to generate labels. The label reports contain information such as bar codes, prices, and other relevant data, and also specify the size of the labels to print and the orientation of the label page. After label reports are set up in this step, users select which report to use every time they generate labels.

1.  Click **Retail essentials** \> **Inventory management** \> **Setup** \> **Bar codes and labels** \> **Shelf label reports**.

2.  In the **Shelf label report setup** form, in the **Report name** field, select the shelf label report to use. The **Report name** field contains a list of the reports that are available. Add as many shelf label reports as you need for your products.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Based on the requirements of the business, you can also create new reports and add them to the list of reports that are available.</P>
