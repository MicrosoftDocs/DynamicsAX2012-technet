# Deprecated:Task groups 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, task groups are used to specify alternative work centers that can perform similar tasks. In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, task groups are upgraded to resource capabilities.

<td><p>Reason for deprecation</p></td>
<td><p>Architectural changes in AX 2012 introduced a new resource model and capability-based scheduling. Therefore, the concept of task groups became obsolete.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Replaced by another feature</p></td>
<td><p>Yes. Task groups have been replaced by the more versatile concept of capabilities, which can be used to specify resource requirements for operations. Therefore, the scheduling engine can choose between alternative resources that can perform similar tasks.</p>
