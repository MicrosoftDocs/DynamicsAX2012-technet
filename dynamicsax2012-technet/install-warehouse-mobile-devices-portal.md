# Install Warehouse Mobile Devices Portal 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

Warehouse Mobile Devices Portal lets users complete tasks in a warehouse facility by using mobile devices. Warehouse Mobile Devices Portal includes a website that can be accessed by mobile devices, and therefore must be installed on a server that runs Internet Information Services (IIS).

Warehouse Mobile Devices Portal communicates with Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Object Server (AOS) by using Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) services.

If you’re using Warehouse Mobile Devices Portal with multiple companies in Microsoft Dynamics AX, you must install an instance of Warehouse Mobile Devices Portal for each company. Each instance must use a different service account. If the instances are installed on the same computer, they must use different port numbers.

## Before you install Warehouse Mobile Devices Portal

  - Create service accounts. You must create a separate service account for each instance of Warehouse Mobile Devices Portal that you plan to install. Each service account is used as the application pool identity for a Warehouse Mobile Devices Portal website. For more information, see [Create service accounts](create-service-accounts.md).

  - On the computer where you plan to install this component, run the prerequisite validation utility to verify that system requirements have been met. For information about how to run the prerequisite validation utility, see [Check prerequisites](check-prerequisites.md).
    
    For more information about the hardware and software requirements for Microsoft Dynamics AX, see the [system requirements](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=165377).
