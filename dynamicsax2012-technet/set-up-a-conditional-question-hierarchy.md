When you set up a questionnaire, you can select to use conditional question hierarchies. For more information, see [About conditional question hierarchies](about-conditional-question-hierarchies.md).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Before you can set up a conditional question hierarchy, you must attach questions with assigned answer groups to the questionnaire. For more information, see <A href="setting-up-questionnaires.md">Setting up questionnaires</A>, <A href="designing-questionnaires.md">Designing questionnaires</A>, and <A href="using-questionnaires.md">Using questionnaires</A>.</P>

    For more information about the **Questionnaires** form, see [Questionnaires (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa576998\(v=ax.60\)).

2.  Select a questionnaire.
    
    Verify that **Conditional** is selected in the **Sequence** list on the **Setup** tab.

5.  Click **Yes** to move the question.

6.  Select the conditional question, and in the **Answer** field, enter the sequence number for the answer in the answer group that the conditional question should depend on. For example, if one of the answers in the answer group has a sequence number of 1 and an answer of Outstanding, enter **1**.
    
    You can select answers from the answer group that is assigned to the primary question.
