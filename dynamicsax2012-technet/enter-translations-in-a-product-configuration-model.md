# Enter translations in a product configuration model 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can provide translated versions of product configuration models by translating the names and descriptions of elements such as attributes, components, and subcomponents to the languages available in Microsoft Dynamics AX.

1.  Click **Product information management** \> **Common** \> **Product configuration models**. Select the product configuration model to translate, and then, on the **Action Pane**, click **Translation**.

2.  On the **Translation** form, click the **Select language** button next to the **Language** field, and then select the language to translate to.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The <STRONG>Language</STRONG> field suggests the system language that is currently selected. If you do not select the language to translate to, the translated text overwrites the original text.</P>



3.  Select the element of the product configuration model in the list on the left part of the form, and then expand the **Translation** FastTab.

4.  In the **Name** and the **Description** field groups, the **Original text** fields display the source text to translate. Enter the translation in the **Translated text** fields.

5.  Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each element of the product configuration model to translate.
