# About free text invoice workflows 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can set up a workflow for free text invoices to require that free text invoices be submitted for approval. You can require that all free text invoices be submitted, or only those that meet specified conditions.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you do not want any free text invoices to be submitted for review, do not set up a workflow for free text invoices.</P>



Even if your organization submits free text invoices for review, you can create conditional statements in the workflow so that some invoices are automatically approved in certain situations. For example, you might specify a condition where, if the invoice total is less than 500.00, the invoice can be approved without user intervention. Also, the workflow that you set up determines which users, if any, must approve the invoice, and when to route the invoice through the workflow process.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Before you complete the procedures in this topic, you should be familiar with the general workflow functionality. For more information, see <A href="workflow-for-microsoft-dynamics-ax.md">Workflow for Microsoft Dynamics AX</A>.</P>



The configuration of the workflow varies from organization to organization, as do business processes. Therefore, you must configure the workflows to match the business processes for free text invoices in your organization.

The following examples illustrate workflows that are frequently used by organizations for free text invoice approvals.
