# About time registration workers [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

To register time in **Time and attendance**, workers must be set up as time registration workers in the company that they are employed in.

Time registration workers can enter different types of time registrations, for example, clock in, clock out, registration on indirect activities, and absence registration. Payroll data can be generated based on the workers’ registrations.

Workers can make registrations for time and item consumption on production jobs or projects that use the **Job registration** form.

Workers can also enter registrations for the amount of time they use a machine on the shop floor. This requires that the machine is set up as a resource in the **Organization administration** module. For more information about how to create resources, see [Create and maintain operations resources](create-and-maintain-operations-resources.md).


> [!TIP]
> <P>In <STRONG>Time and attendance</STRONG>, a worker can be automatically assigned the time registrations that are made on a particular machine on the shop floor. This happens when a worker opens the <STRONG>Job registration</STRONG> form for a machine, selects to work as an assistant to the machine, and then selects the jobs to be started. For more information about how to register as an assistant, see <A href="key-tasks-work-with-production-jobs-in-manufacturing-execution.md">Key tasks: Work with production jobs in Manufacturing execution</A>.</P>



Time registration workers are associated with groups, such as a profile group, a calculation group, or an approval group. These groups are used with calculation and approval of time registrations, and calculation of workers’ pay based on their registrations.
