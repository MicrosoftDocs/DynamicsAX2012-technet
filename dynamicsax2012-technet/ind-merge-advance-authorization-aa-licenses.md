# (IND) Merge Advance authorization (AA) licenses 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can merge export-import (EXIM) Advance Authorization (AA) incentive schemes and common processes that are related to the incentive schemes under the following conditions:

  - The status of the AA schemes is set to **Approved**.

  - The product group and port ID that are assigned to the selected AA schemes are the same.

  - The license status of the selected transaction lines is **Original**.

  - The import expiration date of the selected transaction lines is still valid.

After you merge the selected AA schemes, you can apply to the customs authority to approve the new merged AA license. After the customs authority approves the merge, you can export and import materials based on the new authorization.

When multiple authorizations are merged, the following actions occur:

  - The import and export expiration dates of the most recent authorization are used as the import and export expiration dates of the merged authorization.

  - The status of the merged AA schemes is updated to **Merged**.

  - In the **EXIM Authorization schemes** form, the **Close** check box is selected for the AA schemes that were merged.

  - A new AA scheme is created for the merged AA schemes. The new AA scheme has a status of **Approved**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can also merge multiple AA schemes into an existing AA scheme that you select, instead of creating a new AA scheme.</P>
