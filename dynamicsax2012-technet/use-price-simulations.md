# Use price simulations 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use the following procedures to work with price simulations.

## Create a header price simulation

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Common** \> **Sales quotations** \> **All quotations**. Open the quotation that you want to create a price simulation for.

2.  In the **Sales quotation** form, on the **Action Pane**, on the **Quotation** tab, click **Price simulation**.

3.  In the **Price simulation** form, press CTRL+N to create a new line, and then on the **Simulated prices** tab, enter a new value in the **New discount percentage** field.

4.  To view the changes, move your pointer to the next field.

## Create a single line-item price simulation

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Common** \> **Sales quotations** \> **All quotations**. Open the quotation that you want to create a price simulation for.

2.  On the **Lines** FastTab, select a line item, and then click **Sales quotation line** \> **Prices**.

3.  In the **Price simulation** form, press CTRL+N to create a new line, and then on the **Simulated prices** tab, enter a new value in the **New sales price per unit** field.

4.  To view the changes, move your pointer to the next field.

## View a price simulation

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Common** \> **Sales quotations** \> **All quotations**.

2.  Open the quotation that includes the price simulation that you want to view.

3.  Do one of the following:
    
      - To view price simulations at the header level, on the **Action Pane**, on the **Quotation** tab, click **Price simulation**.
    
      - To view price simulations for a single line, select the line on the **Lines** FastTab, and then click **Sales quotation line** \> **Prices**.

## Apply a price simulation

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Common** \> **Sales quotations** \> **All quotations**.

2.  Open the quotation that includes the price simulation that you want to apply.

3.  Do one of the following:
    
      - To apply price simulations at the header level, on the **Action Pane**, on the **Quotation** tab, click **Price simulation**.
    
      - To apply price simulations to a single line, select the line on the **Lines** FastTab, and then click **Sales quotation line** \> **Prices**.

4.  In the **Run price simulation** form, select the price simulation that you want to apply, and then click **Apply price simulation**.

## Delete a price simulation

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Common** \> **Sales quotations** \> **All quotations**.

2.  Open the quotation that includes the price simulation that you want to delete.
