# (USA) Download orders from online marketplaces 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When customers purchase the products that you list for sale in online marketplaces, Commerce Services for Microsoft Dynamics ERP creates the sales orders online. Microsoft Dynamics AX downloads the orders automatically according to the synchronization schedule. By default, Microsoft Dynamics AX synchronizes with Commerce Services every 15 minutes. Alternately, you can synchronize orders on demand. Either way, the downloaded orders become part of the regular sales order process in Microsoft Dynamics AX.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This feature is not available if Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 is installed.</P>



## Synchronize orders on demand

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Periodic** \> **Commerce Services** \> **Synchronize orders**.

2.  Select the **Batch processing** check box.

3.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Common** \> **Sales orders** \> **All sales orders**.

4.  View and process the sales orders according to your organization's procedures.
