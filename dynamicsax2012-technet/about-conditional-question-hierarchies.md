# About conditional question hierarchies 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Conditional question hierarchies are optional when you set up a questionnaire.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Before you can set up a conditional question hierarchy, you must attach questions with assigned answer groups to the questionnaire. For more information, see <A href="setting-up-questionnaires.md">Setting up questionnaires</A>, <A href="designing-questionnaires.md">Designing questionnaires</A>, and <A href="using-questionnaires.md">Using questionnaires</A>.</P>



To use conditional questions to create a question hierarchy in a questionnaire, you can make the sequence in which questions are presented dependent on the answers that are selected by a respondent for each question. By basing the question sequence on a respondentâ€™s answer, you can modify the questionnaire to the respondent.

## Example

When a legal entity offers customers both items and services, some customers typically purchase only items or only services, and some purchase both. When the legal entity distributes a satisfaction survey, it can apply a conditional structure to the questionnaire to prevent customers who purchase only services from having to answer questions about items.

For example, you can set up a questionnaire so that if a respondent selects Answer A for Question 1, then Question 2 might be next in the question sequence. If the respondent selects Answer B for Question 1, then Question 5 could be next.

## Possible next steps

The following links provide a logical progression to follow in the sequence. Depending on the questionnaire features that you are using, refer to the following information about the next steps:
