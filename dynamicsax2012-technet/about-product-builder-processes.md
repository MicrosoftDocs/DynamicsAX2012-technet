# About Product Builder processes 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This topic contains an overview of the main processes that are supported by the **Product Builder** module.

The **Product Builder** module’s key processes are as follows:

  - Identification and creation of modeling-enabled items, together with the modeling variables and variable groups that are required to create product models for these items.

  - Creation of user profiles, default routes, and default values that can be used in the product models (optional).

  - Creation of product models (including calculation variables) that determine the properties of the finished products.

  - Creation of validation rules for the product model’s user dialog box.

  - Addition of nodes to the product model’s modeling tree.

  - Quotation creation in **Sales and marketing**, **Accounts receivable**, **Project**, or **Enterprise Portal**; order creation in **Procurement and sourcing**, **Accounts receivable**, **Production**, **Enterprise Portal**, or through **Customer self-service**; item-requirement creation in **Project**. Items are configured directly, because the values that are required by each product model’s modeling variable are entered in the product model’s user dialog box. To simplify this process, the modeling variables can be furnished with customer-dependent default values.

  - Automatic creation of standard bills of materials (BOMs) and standard routes of production for each configured item, in a process that is fully controlled by each product model’s modeling tree.

  - Sales-price calculation by using either the price combinations that are defined in the **Product Builder** module or the standard BOM calculation.

  - Calculation of the delivery date by using the **Master planning** module.
