# About answer groups and answers 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Answer groups and answers are required components that make up the main body of information that questions are created from.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Before you can set up answer groups and answers, you must set up prerequisite steps. For more information, see <A href="prerequisites-for-questionnaire.md">Prerequisites for questionnaire</A>, see <A href="using-questionnaires.md">Using questionnaires</A> and <A href="designing-questionnaires.md">Designing questionnaires</A>.</P>



Answer groups contain a set of answers, or response options, for closed questions on a questionnaire. After you create an answer group, you can associate the answer group with a question in the **Answer group** field in the **Questions** form. (Click **Home** \> **Common** \> **Questionnaires** \> **Design** \> **Questions**.)


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Modifying answer text in answer groups that have been used on completed questionnaires can make the evaluation of data difficult and can invalidate the questionnaire results. Consider creating a new answer group, instead. Also, you cannot delete answer groups that are attached to a question or answer, or that have been answered.</P>



There are two ways that respondents can answer a question, depending on the subject of the question:

  - Type a response as text, a number, a date, or time. These questions typically require the respondents to provide subjective information in their answers, such as an opinion, an evaluation, or an estimate.

  - Select an answer from a list of possible correct answers. The list is typically includes one or more facts or truths and one or more distracters.

To provide a list of possible answers, you can create answers in the **Answer groups** form (Click **Home** \> **Common** \> **Questionnaires** \> **Design** \> **Answer groups**.)

After you create a question for a questionnaire, you can then select the appropriate answer group.

An answer group can be used on more than one question on the same questionnaire, and on more than one questionnaire.
