When a sales quotation does not result in a sale, you can register the winning competitor on the quotation. You can use this information for future reference and for statistics. To register the winning competitor, you must have registered competitors on the quotations in question.

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Common** \> **Opportunities** \> **All opportunities**. Create a new opportunity or double-click an existing opportunity to open it.

2.  In the **Opportunities** form, click the **Competitors** FastTab, and then add a new line or select the competitor that won the order.

3.  Select the **Winner** check box for the winning competitor.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can register more than one winner of a quotation, but the reason the quotation did not result in a sale can be associated only with the first competitor who is defined as the winner.</P>
