# Work with forecast positions 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to add existing positions to a budget planning process and scenario, copy forecast positions that are already in the forecast, or create new positions for the next budget cycle. After you add a position to a forecast, you can add and change specific budget cost elements for the position so that the elements are accurate, or update multiple positions at the same time using the mass-update functionality.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic includes information updated for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 Cumulative Update 8 and the KB3043775 hotfix. If you are using a version of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 earlier than cumulative update 7, see <A href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj729760(v=ax.60)">Key tasks: Forecast positions</A>.</P>



The following illustration shows the steps that are required to create a position forecast. The numbers correspond to the procedures later in this topic.

## 1\. Add the initial positions to the forecast

Forecast positions are independent from Human resources positions so that they don’t affect current operations. To create one or more forecast positions, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Periodic** \> **Budget planning** \> **Forecast positions**.

2.  Create, copy, or add the new position to the forecast. Note that if you use an existing position as the basis for a new position, the two positions are no longer linked after the new position is created.
    
    There are several ways to add positions to a budget forecast.

3.  Optional: To view the forecast positions, click **Refresh** on the **Action Pane** of the **Forecast positions** list page.

4.  Open any position and enter additional information, or make any necessary changes. Note that the **Position generation date** field displays the date that the initial forecast position values were based on.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Any changes that you make to the forecast position do not affect the job or position that the initial creation was based on.</P>



## 2\. Make changes to the forecast positions

To change an existing forecast position, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Periodic** \> **Budget planning** \> **Forecast positions**.

2.  Double-click the position to view the details.
    
    To filter the choices, press Ctrl+G. You can limit the search results to a specific field, such as **Department**.

3.  Click **Edit**.

4.  Complete the following fields on the **Budget planning** tab.

When you recalculate, on the <strong>Budget cost elements</strong> tab, the <strong>Annual amount</strong> and <strong>Budget amount</strong> columns are updated. For example, if you reduce the <strong>Full-time equivalent</strong> value from 1.0 to .5 on a position that has a base pay calculation of 100,000, the new budget amount is 50,000.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">

    <p><strong>Retirement</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>If you change the <strong>Activation</strong> or <strong>Retirement</strong> date and the change affects the starting or ending date of one or more budget cost element lines, you are prompted to recalculate the costs. For example, the start date of the budget cost element is April 1, 2014. If you change the position activation date from January 1, 2014, to July 1, 2014, the budget cost element start date changes to July 1, 2014. This change affects the budgeted amount.</p>
    <div class="alert">

    > [!WARNING]
    > <P>If changing the activation or retirement date causes the starting or ending date of a budget cost element to occur outside of the position date range, the budget cost element line is removed. For example, if a budget cost line isn’t in effect until July 1, 2014, and you change the end date of the position from December 31, 2014, to June 30, 2014, the line is removed.</P>

    </table>


## 3\. If required: Add individual budget cost elements

You can assign individual budget cost elements to multiple forecast positions instead of assigning them to a compensation group or manually adding them individually to each forecast position.

To add a cost element to forecast positions, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Setup** \> **Budget planning** \> **Budget cost elements**.

2.  Select the budget cost element to assign positions to. On the action strip, click **Add to positions**.

3.  In the **Add budget cost elements** form, select the forecast positions to add the budget cost element. You can press Ctrl+G to filter the list of forecast positions.

4.  Click **Add** to move the forecast positions to the lower grid.

5.  Verify that you selected the appropriate positions, and then click **Assign**. A message appears that indicates the number of positions that were updated and the forecast positions that were not updated, if applicable.

## 4\. If required: Periodically update forecast positions with cost element changes

It is often necessary to update a cost element after it is assigned to a position, such as when a cost element is finalized or if a tax rate changes. When this happens, you must update the positions that use the cost element so that they reflect the updated costs. Although you can do this for each individual position, it might be more efficient to use the **Update positions** functionality to make the change for all the positions at the same time.

To update forecast positions, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Setup** \> **Budget planning** \> **Budget cost elements**.

2.  Select the budget cost element and make any necessary changes.

3.  Optional: On the **Cost calculation** tab, click **Change dates**. Change the effective or expiration dates and then click **OK** to automatically update all forecast positions that have the cost element assigned.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>By default in AX 2012 R3 CU8, the Start date for the forecast position cost element becomes the Effective date of the budget plan line when the line is generated.</P>



4.  On the action strip, click **Update positions**.

5.  In the **Update positions with cost element changes** form, the forecast positions that have the cost element assigned are displayed. Select the forecast positions to update, and then click **Add** to move them to the lower grid.
    
    You can press Ctrl+G to filter the list of forecast positions.

6.  Verify that you selected the appropriate positions, and then click **Update**. A message appears that indicates the number of positions that were updated and the forecast positions that were not updated, if applicable.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If the <STRONG>Retain value</STRONG> field is set to <STRONG>Yes</STRONG> for a budget cost line and there is a percentage change, the amount will not be updated, but the <STRONG>Effective</STRONG>, <STRONG>Expiration</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Main account</STRONG> fields will be updated if they were changed.</P>



## 5\. If required: Periodically update forecast positions with compensation increases

It is often necessary to update the compensation for forecast positions after they are added to a forecast, such as when there is a rate increase, or if a worker receives a scheduled raise. Although you can do this for each individual forecast position, it is usually more efficient to use the **Generate increases** functionality so that you can update multiple positions at the same time.


> [!TIP]
> <P>This feature is also helpful for comparing different scenarios that have the same forecast position assigned to them. For example, if you change the values in a compensation grid, you can select the positions in one budget plan scenario to apply them without updating the other budget plan scenarios that the forecast positions are assigned to.</P>



When you generate increases, positions are updated as follows:

  - A new earning line is added to the forecast position. This will be the compensation group's default budget cost element and the start date of the line will be the scheduled increase date.

  - The end date of the current step and level earning budget cost element will be set to the day before the scheduled increase.

  - The earning line will be deleted and replaced with a new line if the increase earnings cost element already exists, unless the **Retain value** field is set to **Yes**.

  - A new earning line will be created with the same step value if the forecast position is at the highest step. This allows you to make manual increases to the line, if applicable.

  - Multiple increase lines are created for each year if the budget cycle contains more than one calendar year.

To update forecast positions, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Periodic** \> **Budget planning** \> **Forecast positions**.

2.  On the **Action Pane**, click **Generate increases**.
