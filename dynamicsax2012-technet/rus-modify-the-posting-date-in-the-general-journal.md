# (RUS) Modify the posting date in the general journal 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can settle vendor payments by using dimension control. If the dimension set that is specified in the **Vendor posting profiles** form does not match the dimension set that is specified for the transaction, the settlement is canceled. You can also settle payments for customers and advance holders by using dimension control.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>When different dimension sets are specified for two transactions, settlement transactions are controlled by the summary set.</P>
> <P>For example, you want to settle a payment transaction and an invoice transaction. For the payment transaction, you specify a posting profile that has dimension set D1. Dimension set D1 contains the d1 and d2 dimensions for control. For the invoice transaction, you specify a posting profile that has dimension set D2. Dimension set D2 contains the d2, d3, and d4 dimensions for control. When transactions are settled, transactions are controlled by the summary set d1, d2, d3, and d4.</P>
