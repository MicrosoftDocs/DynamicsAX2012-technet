# Set up sellable days for a customer 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use this procedure to set up the number of days that a customer defines as the sellable period for a product, item group, or all items. The sellable period is the number of days that a product is considered to be sellable. The period starts on the date the product is received, and ends on the best before date or the shelf life date.

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Customers** \> **All customers**.

2.  Select the customer account.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Sell** tab, in the **Setup** group, select **Sellable days**.

4.  Press CTRL+N to add a new line.

5.  In the **Item code** field, select an option to define whether the sellable days apply to a specific item, item group, or all items for this customer:
    
      - **Table** — Applies to a specific item.
    
      - **Group** — Applies to an item group.
    
      - **All** — Applies to all items.

6.  In the **Item relation** field, select the item or item group. If you selected the item code **All**, this field is not available.

7.  In the **Sellable days** field, enter the number of days that make up the sellable period.
