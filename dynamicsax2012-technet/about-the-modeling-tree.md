# About the modeling tree 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

After you have created a setup of modeling variables and calculation variables for your product model, you can use them in the modeling tree.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This information applies only to Product builder.</P>



The modeling tree is a graphical representation of the X++ code that will be executed during item configuration. It is made from the nodes that handle calculations, actions for specific variable outcomes, bills of materials, routes, and messages. To simplify the modeling process, you can print a copy of your product model’s variable setup by using the **Composed of** report. Alternatively, you can make a list of all variables, with their names and types. You will need them as you start to use variables in the various nodes that will make up the product model’s modeling tree.
