# (IND) Create tax ledger posting groups and attach an STC number 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can create a ledger posting group for service tax. You can then attach ledger accounts to various components of the service tax for a specific service tax (STC) number or all STC numbers.

The ledger posting group is attached to the service tax code. The posting group contains the ledger accounts that the calculated service tax is posted to.
