# (RUS) Set up a method of payment 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

The method of payment determines the format that is used for export of payment orders. Within the payment type, you can also set up bridging accounts when reconciliation is being done. In this case, when posting payment journals, the payments are reflected in off-balance Accounts payable and banking operations. After banking reconciliation, these transactions are reversed and reflected in Accounts payable and banking accounts. To link actual accounts with payment types, in most cases, the number of payment types created equals the number of accounts that the company holds.
