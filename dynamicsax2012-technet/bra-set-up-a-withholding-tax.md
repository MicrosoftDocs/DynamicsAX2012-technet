# (BRA) Set up a withholding tax 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use this procedure to set up a withholding tax code, a withholding tax type, and a calculation parameter to calculate withholding taxes for consultancy services or professional service payments. You can also enter values for the withholding tax code by using the **Withholding tax values** form.

**Example**

The following table explains how withholding tax is calculated as a percentage of a payment amount in a month.

<table style="width:100%;">

<col style="width: 14%" />

<td><p>BRL 4000.00</p></td>
<td><p>10 percent</p></td>
<td><p>BRL 5000.00</p></td>
<td><p>November 25, 2013</p></td>
<td><p>BRL 4000.00. Because the amount has not exceeded the minimum limit, no withholding tax is applicable to invoice 123.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>345</p></td>
<td><p>November 20, 2013</p></td>
<td><p>BRL 2000.00</p></td>
<td><p>10 percent</p></td>
<td><p>BRL 5000.00</p></td>
<td><p>November28, 2013</p></td>
<td><p>BRL 1400.00, which is the amount that remains after you deduct the withholding tax (BRL 2000 – BRL 600). BRL 600 is the net of withholding tax (6000*10%).</p>
<p>6000.00 is the sum of invoices 123 and 345, to which withholding taxes apply as a percentage of the payment amount in a month.</p></td>
