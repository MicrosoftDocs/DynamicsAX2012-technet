# What's new: Performance Benchmark Software Development Toolkit (SDK) for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Performance Benchmark Software Development Toolkit (SDK) provides extensible features that can help partners and customers develop benchmarks that closely mimic their custom implementations. The Benchmark SDK lets partners and customers quickly develop managed tests that simulate multiple-user activity on Microsoft Dynamics AX. The Benchmark SDK is developed by using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. Therefore, you can use the Load Test functionality to run stress and performance tests for Microsoft Dynamics AX. This functionality lets you set benchmarks for any Microsoft Dynamics AX scenario more easily, because you can collect test results from the Benchmark SDK.

As of November, 2014, the Benchmark SDK has been moved. It is now available from the Downloadable tools section of Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services.
