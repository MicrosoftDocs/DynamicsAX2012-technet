# About setting up profit calculation 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In the **Project statements** area of the **Project management and accounting parameters** form, you can choose how the profit calculations that you can make in the **Project statements** form are made.

The parameter setup affects the output of the **Factors** fields on the **General** tab in the **Project statements** form.

Profit calculation can be based on either the gross margin or the value-added amount, and it can be viewed as a percentage or a factor.

If you choose to calculate profit based on a value-added ratio in the **Project management and accounting parameters** form, you can define the ratio in the following ways:

  - **Value-added factor** – Value-added amount ÷ hour costs

  - **Value-added ratio** – Value-added amount x 100 ÷ revenue

  - **Value-added markup percentage** – Value-added amount x 100 ÷ hour costs

If you choose to calculate profit based on the gross margin ratio in the **Project management and accounting parameters** form, you can define the ratio in the following ways:

  - **Markup factor** – Gross margin ÷ total costs

  - **Contribution ratio** – Gross margin x 100 ÷ revenue

  - **Markup percentage** – Gross margin x 100 ÷ total costs
