# (DEU) Create and submit a VAT report 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use the **Sales tax payment** form to create the VAT declaration as an .xml file. The declaration is also updated to the log in the **Electronic tax declaration log** form. Use the **Electronic tax declaration log** form to create and submit the **German VAT declaration** by using Elektronische Steuereklärungen (ELSTER).

## Copy new certificates and style sheets for ELSTER

Before you create a VAT report, you must copy the additional certificates and style sheet files to submit the VAT declaration by using ELSTER. To complete the ELSTER setup, follow these steps:

1.  After the Microsoft Dynamics AX client is set up, copy all the files in the ElsterTransferHandler.DLL library to the Application folder\\Client\\Bin folder to replace the existing ElsterTransferHandler.DLL library in the \\Client\\Bin folder.

2.  Double-click the **Coala2019.PERM** file, and then install the new COALA2019.PERM certificate on your computer.

3.  In the **Certificate import wizard** form, select **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** in the **Certificate store** field.

4.  Copy the style sheet files, such as **elsteranmeldung**, **elsterbasis**, **geldbetraege**, **steuernummer**, and **ustva** for ELSTER in the Application folder\\Client\\Bin folder. These files are required so that the VAT declaration can be displayed correctly.

## Prerequisites

Complete the following setup procedures to generate the electronic tax declaration:

  - Set up the electronic tax declaration to be submitted by using ELSTER. For more information, see [(DEU) Set up electronic tax declaration](deu-set-up-electronic-tax-declaration.md).

  - Set up a sales tax authority with the German report layout. For more information, see [Set up sales tax authorities](set-up-sales-tax-authorities.md).

  - Set up a settlement period that contains a sales tax authority with the German report layout. For more information, see [Set up a sales tax settlement period](set-up-a-sales-tax-settlement-period.md).

  - Set up the sales tax reporting codes for the German report layout. For more information, see [Sales tax reporting codes (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa588316\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Set up sales tax codes, sales tax groups, and item sales tax groups. For more information, see [Set up and use sales tax codes](set-up-and-use-sales-tax-codes.md), [Set up and use a sales tax group](set-up-and-use-a-sales-tax-group.md), and [Create item sales tax groups](create-item-sales-tax-groups.md).
