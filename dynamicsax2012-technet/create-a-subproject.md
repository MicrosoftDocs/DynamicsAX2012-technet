# Create a subproject 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

1.  Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Common** \> **Projects** \> **All projects**. Select the project for which you want to create a subproject.

2.  On the **Action Pane**, in the **Maintain** group, click **Edit**.

3.  On the **Project hierarchy** FastTab, enter a format in the **Subproject ID format** field if one is not already present, and then click **Edit**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The format that you enter is used to create subproject numbers. Use a character as a separator and the number sign (#) as a number indicator, for example - ##. For a project named 200, this creates subprojects named 200-01, 200-02, and so on.</P>



4.  On the **Project** tab, in the **New** group, click **Subproject**.

5.  In the **Create a subproject** form, fill in the fields for the subproject as you do for a regular project.

A subproject is created. You can now perform on the subproject all of the operations that are associated with a regular project.
