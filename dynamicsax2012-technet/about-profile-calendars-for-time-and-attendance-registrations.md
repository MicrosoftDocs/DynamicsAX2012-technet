# About profile calendars for time and attendance registrations 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The profile calendar is used to apply a specific work time profile to one or more workers on specific dates.

You can use this functionality in situations where you must make a temporary change to a work time profile, such as when shift work cannot be handled by using the profile groups. When you create a profile calendar entry for a worker, the workerâ€™s time registrations are calculated for a profile that is different from his or her standard work time profile for a specific period of time.
