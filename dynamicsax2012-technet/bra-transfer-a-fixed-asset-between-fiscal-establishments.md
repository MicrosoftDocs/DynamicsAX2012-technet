# (BRA) Transfer a fixed asset between fiscal establishments 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

When a fixed asset that has a CIAP fixed asset record is transferred from one fiscal establishment to another within the same legal entity, the CIAP accumulation must end in the original fiscal establishment, and a new CIAP fixed asset accumulation must start in the new fiscal establishment. When the new CIAP fixed asset starts, it will start with the remaining Imposto Sobre Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços (ICMS) amount and the remaining number of installments.
