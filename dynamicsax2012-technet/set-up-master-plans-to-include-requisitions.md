# Set up master plans to include requisitions 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can set up Microsoft Dynamics AX to include requisition demand in master scheduling. After this is set up, approved requisitions that have a purpose of replenishment are automatically released to master scheduling, and the fulfillment method for the demand created by these requisitions is automatically determined. It is determined by the supply policies that have been set up for the items in your organization and planned by using master scheduling. After a replenishment requisition has been created and approved, no additional user action is required.

In master plans, you can also enter the number of days in the past when demand from approved requisitions is included in master scheduling. For example, you can indicate if only unfulfilled, past-due demand from approved requisitions that were created in the last 10 days should be considered and planned for. In this case, demand created more than 10 days ago is disregarded.
