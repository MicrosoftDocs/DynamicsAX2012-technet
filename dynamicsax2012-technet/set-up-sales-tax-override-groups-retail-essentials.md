# Set up sales tax override groups (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to set up sales tax override groups. Sales tax override groups are composed of two or more sales tax overrides, so that several overrides can be assigned to stores. The overrides themselves must be set up before you can set up override groups.

Overrides are useful, for example, when some customers, such as charitable organizations, children, and indigenous people, are subject to different tax rates. For more information, see [Set up sales tax overrides (Retail essentials)](set-up-sales-tax-overrides-retail-essentials.md).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Retail essentials, the form that you use to complete this task includes a subset of the controls that are available for other configurations of Retail. If a topic about this form describes controls that you don't see, it may be because youâ€™re using Retail essentials.</P>



To set up a sales tax override group, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Retail essentials** \> **Financials** \> **Setup** \> **Sales taxes** \> **Sales tax override groups**.

2.  In the **Sales tax override group** form, click **New** to create a new sales tax override group.

3.  In the **Sales tax override group** field, type a unique identifier for the override group. Then, in the **Description** field, type a name for the override group.

4.  On the **Setup** FastTab, for each sales tax override that you want the group to include, click **Add**, and then, in the **Sales tax override** field, select a sales tax override.

After you set up the sales tax override groups, you must assign the groups to the appropriate stores and set permissions to allow specific cashiers to apply overrides. For more information, see [Assign sales tax groups to stores (Retail essentials)](assign-sales-tax-groups-to-stores-retail-essentials.md) and [Set up permission groups and operations (Retail essentials)](set-up-permission-groups-and-operations-retail-essentials.md).
