An advance report is used to report travel expenses that are incurred by an employee during a business trip. Use this procedure to generate and post advance report lines manually.

You can distribute the expense amount between different ledger dimensions. You can then view the ledger entries and verify the distribution of the expense amount.

4.  In the **Disbursement date** field, enter the date of the document that describes the expense.
