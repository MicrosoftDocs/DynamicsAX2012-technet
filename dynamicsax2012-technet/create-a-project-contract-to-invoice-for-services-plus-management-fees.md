# Create a project contract to invoice for services plus management fees 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use these procedures to create a project and project contract, so that you can invoice a customer for your services plus a management fee. The timing of the invoices is negotiated with the customer.

**Example**

Your organization is a management consulting firm that agrees to provide services to a retail company. The retail customer wants your organization to conduct market research to evaluate the viability of a new product. Your organization enters into an agreement with the customer to provide management consultants to conduct the research for the cost of time and materials. The customer agrees to pay 100.00 per hour for the consultants. The customer also agrees to pay an additional management fee of 10 percent for the consulting hours that are charged to the project.

Use these procedures to set up a contract, an associated project, and the billing rules. The billing rules are used to calculate the invoice amounts for the time and materials that are posted to the project, plus a management fee that equals 10 percent of the costs.

After you have created the contract and the project, you can set up the details of the project. For example, you can define the activities of the project and assign workers to the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you create a project that has billing rules, you must set up the following project information in the **Project management and accounting parameters** form:

  - Set up the number sequence that is used when you create a billing rule.

  - Set up a fee journal that is used by default to post invoices for projects.

## Create a contract for services plus a management fee

Use this procedure to create a project contract for services plus a management fee.

1.  Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Common** \> **Projects** \> **Project contracts**. Open a project contract from the list.

2.  In the **Project contracts** form, on the **Action Pane**, on the **Project contract** tab, click **Project contract**.

    Click **OK**. This information is copied to the header of the **Project contracts** form.
