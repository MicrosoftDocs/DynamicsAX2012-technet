# (BRA) Process electronic payment remittances 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can make electronic payments by transferring files between a legal entity and a bank:

  - You can generate and send an electronic remittance file to a bank. The export file contains information about invoices that must be received or paid, requests for return invoices, or changes to customer or vendor addresses.

  - You can import a return file from a bank. The return file contains information about the acceptance of an invoice together with the payment number that is provided by the bank. Alternatively, the return file contains information about the payments that are received from a customer or paid to a vendor. For more information, see [(BRA) Process electronic payment returns](bra-process-electronic-payment-returns.md).

Use this procedure to generate an export file for a customer or vendor payment. After you generate the export file, the payment status in the **Payment status** field on the **Overview** tab in the **Journal voucher** form is updated to **Sent**.

You can use a simple or complex file structure to generate a remittance file. If you use a complex file structure to generate the remittance file, you must specify the payment type, payment way, and segments for the complex file structure. For more information, see [(BRA) Set up an electronic payment process for a complex file structure](bra-set-up-an-electronic-payment-process-for-a-complex-file-structure.md).
