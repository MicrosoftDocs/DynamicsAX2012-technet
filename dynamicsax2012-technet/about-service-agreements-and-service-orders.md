# About service agreements and service orders 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Service agreements are agreements between service providers and customers that specify the amount and type of service that will be provided. These include, for example, monthly service visits for office equipment maintenance. You can automatically create service orders based on service agreements. You can associate service tasks and service objects to a service order line so you can group the service order lines by tasks and objects. All service agreements are attached to projects through which transactions are posted and invoiced.

The following terms are commonly associated with service agreements:

  - Service agreement – This is an agreement between a service provider and a customer that specifies the type and amount of service to be provided. A service agreement can also specify how the customer will be invoiced.

  - Service order – This is a request for a single service visit by one or more technicians.

  - Service order line – This represents the number of service technician hours, items, expenses, and fees.

  - Service object – This is the object on which service work is performed.

  - Service task – This describes the work to be completed during a service order.

  - Project – A temporary job undertaken to perform a particular service.

Service orders can be created from the following pages:

  - Use the **Service agreement** page to create service orders for a service agreement. The service orders are created based on the service agreement and the lines for that agreement.

  - Use the **Service orders** page to create service orders. This can be useful when, for example, you must create an emergency or unscheduled service visit to a customer.

For more information about how to create service orders, see [Create or modify service orders and repair lines](create-or-modify-service-orders-and-repair-lines.md).
