# (RUS) Set up the TORG-13 invoice for internal transfer, movement of goods, and packaging 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Invoices for internal transfer, movement, and packaging of goods are used to monitor the flow of goods and packaging between departments as well as between responsible officers within the organization. The invoices are prepared in duplicate by the responsible officer who is delivering the goods. The delivery department uses one copy to write off the items, and the receiving department uses the second copy to accept the items.
