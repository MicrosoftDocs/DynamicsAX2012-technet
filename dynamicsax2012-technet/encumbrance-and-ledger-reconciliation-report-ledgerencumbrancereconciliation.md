# Encumbrance and ledger reconciliation report (LedgerEncumbranceReconciliation) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The **Encumbrance and ledger reconciliation** report identifies imbalances between budget reservations for encumbrances and pre-encumbrances, and the corresponding budget register entries that are tracked in the general ledger. You can create separate detail and summary versions of the report, and select encumbrances, pre-encumbrances, or both for the same report.

Detail reports display individual purchase orders, purchase requisitions, and budget register entries for the financial dimension that you select. You can create detail reports that display encumbrance and pre-encumbrance amounts that are in balance and out of balance. You can also create differences-only detail reports that display only encumbrance and pre-encumbrance amounts that are out of balance.

Summary reports display totals for encumbrances and pre-encumbrances for the financial dimension that you select. As with the detail reports, you can include in-balance and out-of-balance amounts, or create differences-only reports that display only amounts that are out of balance.

## Prerequisites

Before you run this report, make sure that the following prerequisites have been set up:

  - **Enable budget control** – Budget control is not required to create encumbrances, but it is required to create budget register entries for encumbrances. For more information, see [Set up budget control](set-up-budget-control.md).

  - **Enable encumbrance process** – The encumbrance process must be enabled before encumbrances for purchase orders can be recorded in the general ledger. For more information, see [Encumber purchase orders](encumber-purchase-orders.md).

  - **Select encumbrance accounts to include on the report** – Open the **Main account categories** form and select the **ENCUMBRANCE** main account category. Click **Link main accounts**, and then select the **Linked** check box for each main account to use for encumbrances. For more information, see [Link main accounts (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh209475\(v=ax.60\)).
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>To include pre-encumbrances on the report, select the <STRONG>PRE-ENCUMBRANCE</STRONG> main account category. Click <STRONG>Link main accounts</STRONG>, and then select the <STRONG>Linked</STRONG> check box for each main account to use for pre-encumbrances.</P>
