# Create working time templates 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The first step in setting up working time calendars is to create a working time template. Use the template to define the hours of operation, or the work periods in your production, for each day of the week.

When you set up the working time template, you can also indicate an efficiency level for each period that you define. Efficiency levels are reflected in the capacity of the operations resources and throughout the system.

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Common** \> **Calendars** \> **Working time templates**. Click **New** to create a new line.

2.  On the **Overview** tab, in the **Working time template** field, enter an alphanumeric identifier of up to 10 characters.

3.  In the **Name** field, enter a descriptive name for the template.

4.  Select the tab that corresponds to the day of the week that you want to define working hours for, and click **Add** to create a new line.

5.  In the **From** field, enter the starting time for the day or the period.

6.  In the **To** field, enter the ending time for the day or the period. This can be defined as a day, a shift, or a temporary stop in operation, such as a lunch period.

7.  In the **Efficiency** field, enter the efficiency percentage.

8.  In the **Property** field, select the property for the selected day's working time template.

9.  Repeat steps 4 through 8 for each day of the week.
