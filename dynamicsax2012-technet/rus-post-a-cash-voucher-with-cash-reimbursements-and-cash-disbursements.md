# (RUS) Post a cash voucher with cash reimbursements and cash disbursements 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can post a cash voucher with confirmation by selecting the **Use Confirm Status** check box in the **Bank parameters** form. To post the cash voucher without confirmation, clear the **Use Confirm Status** check box. The confirmation method is most efficient when the chief accountant and cashier certify creation of the cash orders and reimbursement or disbursements of cash.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic has not been fully updated for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2.</P>




> [!NOTE]
> <P>You must enter the voucher transactions with cash reimbursement and cash disbursement details in the <STRONG>Journal voucher</STRONG> form. For more information, see "<A href="rus-register-reimbursement-or-disbursement-slips.md">(RUS) Register reimbursement or disbursement slips</A>".</P>



After you confirm and approve a cash voucher, the cash voucher can have various statuses, depending on the method that you selected.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Validation method</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>Approval status</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>With confirmation</p></td>
<td><p><strong>None</strong>, <strong>Confirmed</strong>, <strong>Approved</strong>, or <strong>Rejected</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Without confirmation</p></td>
<td><p><strong>None</strong> or <strong>Approved</strong></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


After you confirm a voucher, a cash order number is assigned, and you can post it to the ledger accounts.

You can reject the current status of a cash voucher. When rejected, **Approved** vouchers revert to **Confirmed** and **Confirmed** vouchers revert to **None**.

You can reject the confirmed cash vouchers as needed. Rejected vouchers are displayed in the cash order reimbursement and the disbursement registration journal, but they are not registered in the cash book report.
