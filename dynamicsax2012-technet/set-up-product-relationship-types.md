# Set up product relationship types [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Product relationships define how products relate to one another. Before you can define product relationships, you must set up product relationship types. For example, you offer a laptop and a monitor on your procurement site. The monitor is an accessory for the laptop. Therefore, when a requester selects the laptop, you also want the monitor to be displayed. For this to occur, you must define a product relationship type of **Accessory**.

## Set up product relationship types

1.  Click **Product information management** \> **Setup** \> **Relationships** \> **Product relationship types**.

2.  In the **Product relationship types** form, click **New** to add a product relationship type.

3.  Enter a name, friendly name, and description for the product relationship type.

4.  Click **Translate**, and then in the **Text translation** form, enter the name, description, and friendly name for the product relationship type in different languages.

5.  Repeat steps 2 through 4 to define additional product relationship types.
