# Set up visual profiles 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

A visual profile contains basic information that determines the appearance of Microsoft Dynamics AX for Retail POS registers. This topic explains how to use the **POS visual profiles** form to select the POS application and the colors or pictures that are visible on the register.

You can create several visual profiles and assign specific profiles to run on specific registers.
