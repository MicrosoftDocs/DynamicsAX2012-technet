# (BRA) Cancel a purchase complementary fiscal document 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can cancel an incorrect purchase complementary fiscal document and provide a reason for the cancellation. When you cancel a purchase complementary fiscal document, a purchase complementary fiscal document is created with a negative price amount, an Imposto Sobre Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços (ICMS) amount, or an Imposto Sobre Produtos Industrializados (IPI) amount. When you post the negative purchase complementary fiscal document, the original complementary fiscal document is marked as canceled, and all of the ledger transactions and financial transactions are reversed. The original purchase complementary fiscal document is reported in the fiscal books as canceled, and the negative purchase complementary fiscal document is not reported in the fiscal books.
