# About shipping documents 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The bill of lading is a receipt for goods that the carrier agrees to transport and deliver to a designated person.

The bill of lading shows the list of goods that are delivered for transportation. In case of loss, damage, or delay, the bill of lading is the basis for filing freight claims. The bill of lading includes information about:

  - The customer order.

  - The carrier.

  - The origin and destination of the shipment.

  - The number of units in the shipment.

  - Freight-charge terms.

  - Special instructions.

Shipping documents for sales orders and transfer orders can be created in batch. From the **Physical shipment update** form, when you send a shipment, the program can create a bill of lading automatically.
