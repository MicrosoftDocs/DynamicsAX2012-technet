# Set up an audit master for freight reconciliation

Use the **Audit master** form to set up the tolerance level for automatic freight bill matching. When you reconcile freight, you can match freight bills with invoices that have a specified audit tolerance level. If the values that are used for the matching process are in the specified tolerance level, the reconciliation is approved and processed for automatic payment of the invoice. You can create different audit masters for different freight bill types or carrier types.

1.  Click **Transportation management** \> **Setup** \> **Freight reconciliation** \> **Audit master**.

2.  Click **New** to create a new audit master.

3.  On the **Criteria** FastTab, enter the unique criteria for the audit master.

4.  In the **Sequence** field, enter a number to specify the order in which bills are reconciled.

5.  On the **Tolerance** FastTab, select the minimum and maximum values for audit types and tolerance levels.

6.  On the **Result** FastTab, select the reconciliation reason codes for the overage amount and the underage amount.

7.  On the **Exceptions** FastTab, create audit exceptions for the audit master.
