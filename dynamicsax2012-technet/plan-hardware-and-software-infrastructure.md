# Plan hardware and software infrastructure [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When you deploy Microsoft Dynamics AX, you must have a clear understanding of your organization's or customers' requirements. In this manner, you can make good decisions as you recommend hardware and software, install the system, and customize the system.

We recommend that you carefully consider the performance requirements for your deployment during the planning stage, to guarantee that the deployment is successful.

Different roles in your information technology department raise different performance considerations:

  - An infrastructure architect has to balance performance and scalability with other quality of service (QoS) attributes, such as manageability, interoperability, security, and maintainability.

  - A developer has to make sure that your modifications produce the results that users expect.

  - A tester has to validate application functionality, optimization, and expected workloads.

  - A system administrator has to monitor the infrastructure and applications, to make sure that they meet the service level agreements.
