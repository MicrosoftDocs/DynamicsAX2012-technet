For this table collection, the related parameters tables include CustFormLetterParameters, ProjFormletterParameters, RetailParameters, SalesParameters, and CustParameters. Because we recommend that you do not share parameters, make sure that the following settings are the same in all companies that share the CustTable table. Alternatively, verify that the expected setting is used in each company, and correct it if necessary.

  - Payment attachment fields - When you create customers, the default payment attachment options come from the customer form letter parameters and project form letter parameters for the current company.

  - **Require identification with credit selection** and **Limit value** - The system validates the **Mandatory credit limit** and **Credit limit** values for a customer based on the selections for these options in the customer parameters for the current company.

  - **Mandatory tax group** and **Tax exempt number** - You must enter values in the **Sales tax group** and **Tax exempt number** fields if these requirements are selected in the customer parameters for the current company.

  - **Credit limit per agreement** – For companies that operate in Russia, the system validates the **Credit limit** value for a customer based on the selection for the **Credit limit per agreement** option in the customer parameters for the current company.

  - **VAT report date code** – For companies that operate in Poland, the default **VAT report date code** value for a customer comes from the associated customer group or customer parameters for the current company.

  - **Post as shipment** – When you create customers, the default **Post as shipment** value comes from the **Default customer posting** field in the retail parameters for the current company.

  - **Posting type** – For companies that operate in Russia, the default **Posting type** value for customers comes from the **Posting type** field in the sales parameters for the current company.

  - **Generate incoming fiscal document** – For companies that operate in Brazil, the **Generate incoming fiscal document** option is selected by default for customers that are created without ID numbers. The option is selected when those customers are associated with Person records.

We recommend that you do not share InventSite and InventLocation tables. Sites and warehouses are locations at which a specific legal entity performs production activities and stores products. If customer records are shared among company accounts, make sure that the fields that reference these tables are blank.

We recommend that you do not share WHSInventStatus table. Inventory statuses are specific to a legal entity and modification of statuses are only validated against the current company. If customer records are shared among company accounts, make sure that the field that reference the table is blank.

The following company-specific tables have foreign key relationships to the CustTable table. We recommend that you do not share these tables or their dependent tables in a virtual company, because sharing them can cause duplicate index violations in the database.

  - SalesJournalAutoSummary – If customer records are shared among company accounts, you cannot use the automatic summary update feature when you process sales orders.

  - SalesPurchCycle – If customer records are shared among company accounts, you cannot use the sales cycle feature when you process sales orders. The **Sales cycle** option in the sales parameters must not be selected in any of the companies where the CustTable table is shared.
