# Create and print labels overview 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

In Retail, you can generate and print labels to use in stores. A label is a piece of paper, polymer, cloth, metal, or other material that is attached to a product, a container, or a shelf. A label can also be printed directly on a container or an item. Retail offers two types of labels: product labels and shelf labels. Product labels are always specific to a particular variant, but shelf labels don’t have to be.

You can use labels for a variety of purposes, such as the following:

  - Product identification

  - Name tags

  - Bar codes

  - Pricing

  - Warnings

  - Batch numbers

  - Expiration dates

## New or changed for Retail in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3

In addition to being able to generate labels for one product at a time, you can now generate product and shelf labels for multiple products at one time. You can also generate labels for products that are included in transfer orders or purchase orders. After the labels are generated, you can print them.

Generate product and shelf labels for products in the following scenarios:

  - From purchase orders, regardless of the purchase order status

  - From transfer orders when the products are shipped or when transfer orders are received

  - From the **Released products** list page or the **Released product details** form

When you generate labels in these scenarios, you can use the **Print shelf labels** form and the **Print product labels** form to specify the number of labels that you want to print. You can also add products to the list and generate labels for those products at the same time.

The following table lists the additional forms that support the labels business process component in AX 2012 R3. The table entries are organized by business process component task and then alphabetically by form name.
