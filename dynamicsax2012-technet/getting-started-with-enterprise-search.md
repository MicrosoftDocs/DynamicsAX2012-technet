# Getting started with Enterprise Search 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This topic describes the new features and enhancements for Enterprise Search in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012.

## The search experience

Enterprise Search in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 enables users to search through data, metadata, and documents that are attached to records by using either the Microsoft Dynamics AX client or Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX. Users can search for common nouns such as 'customer' and 'cash flow report.' Users can also search for specific data, such as a customer name, product ID, or telephone number. The search box is prominently displayed in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client, and users can view recent search terms in a list.

## The search engine

All aspects of crawling, indexing, and retrieving Microsoft Dynamics AX data and metadata for Search are performed by one of the following products:

  - Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 or Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010

  - Microsoft Search Server 2010 or Microsoft Search Server Express 2010

  - Microsoft FAST Search Server 2010

  - Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2013 or Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013

One of these products must be available in the computing environment before you can install Enterprise Search.
