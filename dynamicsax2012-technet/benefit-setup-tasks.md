# Benefit setup tasks 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

This topic describes how to set up current and future benefits that workers and their dependents and beneficiaries can receive, and also how to maintain payroll information for benefits. Examples of benefits include medical insurance, retirement investments, workers’ compensation plans, and parking benefits.

Garnishments and tax levies are also set up as benefits, although the steps that you must follow to set them up are different. For more information, see [Garnishment and tax levy setup tasks](garnishment-and-tax-levy-setup-tasks.md).

After you set up benefit elements by using the **Benefit elements** form, you must create the benefits so that they can be assigned to workers. When you create a benefit, you link an option to a benefit plan, designate a benefit period, and assign eligibility rules to the benefit.

The following illustration shows the steps that you must follow to set up benefits and mandatory deductions. The numbers correspond to the procedures later in this topic.

## 1\. Set up benefit elements

A benefit is a combination of the benefit type, plan, and option:

  - **Type** – A collection of plans for a specific benefit, such as medical or parking.

  - **Plan** – A specific benefit that is contracted from a provider.

  - **Option** – The coverage level, such as employee only or employee and spouse.

### 1a. Set up benefit types

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Setup** \> **Benefits** \> **Benefit elements**.

2.  In the **Types** area, click **New** to create a benefit type.

3.  Enter this information.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>

    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Type</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Enter the name and a brief description of the benefit type.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Concurrent enrollment</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Select one of the following concurrent enrollment options:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Multiple enrollments per type</strong> – You can enroll a worker in multiple plans that have the same benefit type, even if the enrollment is effective for the same period. For example, a worker can be enrolled in two term life insurance plans.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>One enrollment per type</strong> – You can’t enroll a worker in more than one plan that has the same benefit type for the same period. For example, if the worker already has health insurance for a specified time period, you can’t enroll the worker in another health insurance plan that covers the same period.</p></li>
    </ul></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Payroll category</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Select a payroll category to use for benefits that have the new benefit type. The payroll category determines which settings are available for a selected plan in the <strong>Plans</strong> area of this form. Settings that don’t apply to the payroll category aren’t available.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


Repeat these steps to set up additional benefit types. When you have finished, you can close the form, or continue with “Set up benefit plans.”

### 1b. Set up benefit plans

1.  Click **Payroll** \> **Setup** \> **Benefits** \> **Benefit elements**.

2.  In the **Plans** area, click **New** to create a benefit plan.

    </ul></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


4.  On the **Tax rule** FastTab, select the pretax basis for the plan. The pretax basis determines the pattern of before-tax and after-tax treatment for payroll deductions and employer contributions.
    
    In the rare case that no preset options are appropriate for your plan, select **Custom**, and then select a custom pretax method to specify the taxes that should not be deducted from the paychecks of employees who enroll in the plan. For more information, see [Benefit elements (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh209498\(v=ax.60\)).
    

    > [!WARNING]
    > <P>Select <STRONG>Custom</STRONG> only when no preset patterns are appropriate. If you must use <STRONG>Custom</STRONG>, work with your legal advisors to make sure that you select the correct settings for the benefit plan.</P>

## 2\. Set up contribution calculation rates for retirement benefits

For retirement benefits, the method that is used to determine the employer contribution and the employer contribution rates is determined by the rate table that is defined in the **Contribution calculation rates** form and then assigned to the benefit in the **Benefits** form.

Before you start this task, we recommend that you create a table of your retirement plans. For each plan, include the contribution method, employee deductions, and employer contributions for the plan.

**Example**

Your organization offers two retirement plans. For Plan 1, your organization matches the worker’s own contributions to the plan at 50 percent up to the first 3 percent, and then at 100 percent up to 6 percent. For Plan 2, your organization contributes 1 percent of the worker’s pay to the 401(k) plan when the worker’s own contributions are between 1 percent and 3 percent of their pay; 2 percent when the worker’s own contributions are between 3 percent and 6 percent; and 3 percent of the worker’s pay when the worker’s contributions are 6 percent or more. In this example, your table would look like this.

<td><p><strong>Fixed percent</strong></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


For Plans 1 and 2, the actual amount that the employer contributes depends on the tier type that you select in the **Contribution calculation rates** form. This list describes each tier type and includes an example of how the tier types affect the employer contribution amount for Plans 1 and 2.

  - **Single line** – Use this tier type to use only one line from the rate table to calculate the employer contribution amount.
    
    For Plan 1, if the worker’s contribution rate is 10 percent of their 1000.00 earnings, the employer contribution is 0.00. For Plan 2, the employer contribution is 30.00 for an employee who earns 1000.00 and whose contribution rate is 10 percent.

  - **Cascading tier** – Use this tier type to use multiple lines from the rate table to calculate the employer contribution amount. Only lines that have a deduction rate of less than or equal to the actual worker’s deduction rate are used to calculate the employer deduction amount.
    
    For Plan 1, if the worker’s deduction rate is 10 percent of their 1000.00 earnings, the employer contribution is 45.00. For Plan 2, the employer contribution is 60.00.

This table lists the formula for calculating the employer contribution amount for Plans 1 and 2 for each tier type.

## 3\. Create a new benefit

After you have set up benefit elements by using the **Benefit elements** form, you must create the benefits so that they can be assigned to workers. When you create a benefit, you link an option to a benefit plan, designate a benefit period, and assign eligibility rules to the benefit.

1.  Click **Payroll** \> **Setup** \> **Benefits** \> **Benefits**.

2.  In the **New** group, click **Benefit**, and then enter this information:
    
      - **Plan** – The name of the benefit.
    
      - **Option** – An option to add to the benefit.
    
      - **Effective** – The first date when the benefit is available to a worker.
    
      - **Expiration** – The last date when the benefit is available to a worker.

3.  Click **Create benefit**.

4.  Click **Edit** and then click the **Eligibility rules** FastTab to select the method to use to determine eligibility for this benefit.
    
      - **All workers are eligible** – The benefit is included in eligibility processing, but eligibility rules aren’t enforced for the benefit. All workers are always eligible.
        
        When you select this method, any worker who is included in an eligibility event can enroll in the benefit after the event is processed, but not at any other time. This lets you restrict enrollment in the benefit to the appropriate enrollment periods, without otherwise limiting eligibility for the benefit.
    
      - **Rule based**– User-defined eligibility rules are enforced for the benefit. Select the rule type to use from the **Rule type** list.
        
        This method is used for most benefits.
    
      - **Bypass eligibility process**– The benefit is not included in eligibility processing. Any worker can be enrolled in the benefit at any time. You do not have to process an eligibility event before you enroll a worker in the benefit.
        
        This method is usually used for garnishments and tax levies.

5.  Optional: If there are workers who should be allowed to enroll in this benefit, but who don’t meet the criteria in the eligibility rules, assign an eligibility override for those workers.
    
    1.  On the **Eligibility overrides** FastTab, click **Add**.
    
    2.  In the **Name** field, select the worker to add an override for.
    
    3.  In the **Override start** and **Override end** fields, enter the first and last dates when the override applies. When you determine eligibility for a benefit by using a coverage start date that is in the specified date range, the employee is eligible for the benefit, regardless of the benefit eligibility rules.

6.  On the **Payroll details** FastTab, enter this payroll information for the benefit:
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>This FastTab might include settings only for deductions, only for contributions, or for both deductions and contributions, depending on how the <STRONG>Payroll impact</STRONG> field in the <STRONG>Benefit elements</STRONG> form is set for the benefit plan. If the <STRONG>Payroll impact</STRONG> field is set to <STRONG>None</STRONG>, this FastTab isn’t available. For more information, see <A href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh209498(v=ax.60)">Benefit elements (form)</A>.</P>
    > <P>The values on this FastTab are used as the default values in the <STRONG>Maintain benefits</STRONG> form for each worker who is enrolled in the selected benefit.</P>

    
      - **Frequency** – The payroll calculation frequency that is used to determine the pay periods that the selected benefit is calculated in. Payroll calculation frequencies and pay periods are defined in the **Payroll calculation frequencies** form.
    
      - **Basis** – The option to use together with the value in the **Amount or rate** field to determine the amount to deduct or contribute for the benefit. The amount is calculated only in the pay periods as determined by the payroll calculation frequency. Earnings are included in the calculation only when the earning code for the earnings is listed on the **Earning basis** FastTab and when the required parameters are set in the **Earning codes** form.
        
        For more information about the basis options, see [Benefits (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj680907\(v=ax.60\)).
    
      - **Amount or rate** – The amount or rate to use together with the value in the **Basis** field to determine the amount to deduct or contribute for the benefit.
        
          - If the basis for the deduction is **Fixed amount**, enter the amount to use as the payroll deduction or employer contribution for the selected benefit.
        
          - If the basis for the deduction is **Percent of earnings**, **Regular portion of all pay**, or **Regular earnings**, enter the percentage of the worker’s included earnings or pay to use as the payroll deduction or employer contribution for the selected benefit.
        
          - If the basis for the deduction is **Productive hours**, **Earning hours**, **Regular hours**, or **Total hours**, enter the hourly rate for the payroll deduction or employer contribution.
        
        For more information, see [Benefits (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj680907\(v=ax.60\)).
        
        This field isn’t available when the payroll category that is assigned to the benefit type in the **Benefit elements** form is **Retirement**.
    
      - **Calculation rate** – The variable rate structure that is used to calculate employer contributions to a retirement plan.
        
        This field is available only when the payroll category that is assigned to the benefit type in the **Benefit elements** form is **Retirement**.

7.  On the **Earning basis** FastTab, enter the earning codes that can be included when deductions and contributions for this benefit are calculated.
    
    If the **Payroll impact** field in the **Benefit elements** form is set to **None**, this FastTab isn’t available. For more information, see [Benefit elements (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh209498\(v=ax.60\)).
    
    In addition to the earning codes entered here, the **Basis** setting on the **Payroll details** FastTab, in combination with the parameter settings in the **Earning codes** form, is also used to determine whether a specific earnings line is included in the calculation.
    
    To enter an earning code, click **Add**, and then select the earning code from the list. You can add all earning codes at the same time by clicking **Add all earning codes**.

Repeat these steps to create more benefits. When you have finished, close the form.
