Questionnaire types are required and must be assigned when you create a questionnaire. You can use them to manage and classify questionnaires more easily. For more information, see [Using questionnaires](using-questionnaires.md).

Questionnaire types are used to classify questionnaires and differentiate them from each other. For example, if you have multiple questionnaires to select from, you can filter them by type to help make it easier to find a particular questionnaire.

Examples include the following:

  - Human resource development

  - Customer surveys

  - Review process
