# Issue worker payments 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

This topic explains how to submit pay statements, generate checks or electronic payments, generate a positive pay file for payroll, and post the payment journal.

You can pay workers by check or by electronic payment. When you submit pay statements, an invoice is created and posted to the general ledger for the sum of the worker’s net pay for the payroll vendor that is set up in the **Payroll parameters** form. A payment journal that has lines is created, which lets you generate and post payments. In addition, you can optionally post the payroll costs that are associated with workers to the general journal when you submit payments.

## Submit pay statements for multiple workers in a pay period

Complete these steps to create a payment journal for multiple pay statements at the same time.

You must generate and release earnings before you generate pay statements. For more information, see [Generate earnings](generate-earnings.md).

To submit pay statements for multiple workers at the same time, following these steps:

1.  Generate pay statements so that earnings, benefits, and taxes are calculated. For more information, see [Work with pay statements](work-with-pay-statements.md).
    

    > [!TIP]
    > <P>Before you generate pay statements, we recommend that you view the <STRONG>Pay statements to recalculate</STRONG> list page to verify that no pay statements must be recalculated. For more information, see “Modify pay statements” in <A href="work-with-pay-statements.md">Work with pay statements</A>.</P>



2.  Click **Payroll** \> **Periodic** \> **Pay statement processing** \> **Submit pay statements**.

3.  In the **Pay cycle** field, select the same pay cycle that you selected when you generated and released earnings.

4.  In the **Pay period** field, select the same pay period that you selected when you generated and released earnings. The pay periods that are displayed are available for the pay cycle. The default pay period is the first open pay period, but you can select any open pay period from the list.

5.  Click **OK** to submit the pay statements. A vendor invoice for the sum of the net pay for all pay statements is created and posted. A payment journal that has lines is also created and posted, so you can generate and post payments. A message is displayed to indicate that the payment journal was generated successfully and that a voucher and invoice details were created.

6.  Close the confirmation message.

7.  Click **Payroll** \> **Common** \> **Pay statements** \> **Submitted pay statements**. A list of submitted statements is displayed and an icon appears in the first column of the **Pay statement** grid to indicate that the payment was submitted.

8.  View the payment journal, and then generate checks and electronic payments. Click **Payroll** \> **Periodic** \> **Pay statement processing** \> **Payment journal**.

## Submit individual pay statements

To create a payment journal for an individual pay statement, follow these steps:

1.  Generate pay statements so that earnings, benefits, and taxes are calculated. For more information, see [Work with pay statements](work-with-pay-statements.md).

2.  Click **Payroll** \> **Common** \> **Pay statements** \> **Calculated pay statements**.

3.  Select the worker pay statement to create the payment journal for, and then click **Submit for payment**.
    
    The **Submit for payment** button is also available in the **Pay statement** form.

    You can post the pay statements as a separate step at any time. Click **Payroll** \> **Periodic** \> **Pay statement processing** \> **Post pay statements**.

5.  Click **Submit** to submit the pay statements. A vendor invoice is created and posted for the net pay of the pay statement. A payment journal that has lines is also created, so you can generate and post the payment. A message is displayed to indicate that the payment journal was generated successfully and that a voucher and invoice details were created.

6.  Close the message. An icon appears in the first column of the **Pay statement** grid to indicate that the payment was submitted.

7.  View the payment journal and generate checks and electronic payments. Click **Payroll** \> **Periodic** \> **Pay statement processing** \> **Payment journal**.

## Generate checks or electronic payments for a payment journal

To generate checks and electronic payments for workers, follow these steps after you submit the pay statements and generate the payment journal.


> [!WARNING]
> <P>If you didn’t finish the bank account disbursements before the pay statements were generated, the worker will be paid by check. For more information, see <A href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj677398(v=ax.60)">Bank account disbursements (form)</A>.</P>



1.  Click **Payroll** \> **Periodic** \> **Pay statement processing** \> **Payment journal**.

2.  Select the payment journal, and then click **Lines** on the action strip to view the **Journal voucher**.

3.  Validate that the number of vouchers is correct. There is one journal voucher line for each check pay statement and one or more journal voucher lines for each electronic pay statement.

4.  From the **Functions** menu, select **Generate payments**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You must complete this step separately for electronic and check payments. Therefore, if you’re generating both, you must complete this step two times.</P>



5.  In the **Generate payments** form, select the method of payment and the bank account.

6.  Click **OK** to generate the payment for the records that match the method of payment and the bank account.
    
      - If you selected **Check method of payment**, the **Payroll check payment** form opens. Verify the starting check number in the **From** field and the printing destination, and then click **OK** to print the checks.
    
      - If you selected the electronic method of payment, the **Payroll electronic** (Direct deposit) form opens. Enter the path where you want the ACH file to be created (including the file name), enter an effective date and the printing destination, and optionally, select the **Pay statement** check box to print the pay statements. Click **OK** to create the ACH file.
        

        > [!TIP]
        > <P>You can later print pay statements from the <STRONG>Reports</STRONG> menu.</P>

        
        The payment status is set to **Sent** for each payment that was generated.

## Generate a positive pay file for payroll

You can generate an electronic list of payroll checks that is provided to the bank. When a payroll check is presented to the bank, the bank compares the check to the list of checks. If the check matches what the bank has on file in the list, the bank clears the check. If there is a difference, the bank holds the check for review.

To generate a positive pay file for payroll, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll** \> **Periodic** \> **Pay statement processing** \> **Payroll positive pay**.

2.  In the **Cut-off date** field, enter the last check date to include in the positive pay file. All checks that haven’t been included in a positive pay file through this check date are included in the file.

3.  Click **OK**.
    
    If you receive this error message, contact a system administrator because security for the positive pay file folder isn’t set up correctly and you can’t complete this procedure: **Endpoint is not allowed to perform this action.**

## Confirm a positive pay file for payroll

After the checks that are listed in a payroll positive pay file are paid, you receive a confirmation number from the bank. Then, you can confirm the positive pay file in Microsoft Dynamics AX. When you confirm a positive pay file, you record the confirmation number that you received from the bank.

To confirm a positive pay file, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll** \> **Inquiries** \> **Payroll positive pay file summary**.

2.  Select a payroll positive pay file that has a status of **Created**.

3.  Click **Confirmation**.

4.  Enter the confirmation number that you received from the bank.

5.  Click **OK**.

## If required: Recall a positive pay file

If you have to change a payroll positive pay file, you can recall it. When you recall a positive pay file, the field that indicates whether each check has been included in a positive pay file is reset. Then, you can create a new positive pay file.

To recall a positive pay file, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll** \> **Inquiries** \> **Payroll positive pay file summary**.

2.  Select a payroll positive pay file that has a status of **Created**.

3.  Click **Recall**. A message confirms that the recall process was successful.

## Post a payment journal

You can post a payment journal after you generate checks and electronic payments, as described earlier in this topic.

To post a payment journal, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll** \> **Periodic** \> **Pay statement processing** \> **Payment journal**.

2.  Select the payment journal, and then click **Lines** on the action strip to view the **Journal voucher** form.

3.  From the **Post** menu, select **Post**. The payment journal lines are settled to the vendor invoice that was created and posted. A message is displayed to indicate the number of vouchers that were posted.
