# Set up asset activity codes [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can set up asset activity codes in the **Asset activity codes** form. You can then track fixed assets according to the activity categories they are used for, such as construction and other types of equipment.

Asset activity codes are often used together with other fixed asset codes, such as fixed asset groups, major types, and property groups. For example, a public works department could have a fixed asset group of Vehicles, a major type of Trucks, an asset activity code of Construction, and property groups of Dump Truck and Cement Mixer.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>These codes are optional, and you can use them according to your business needs to track additional information about fixed assets for your organization. Set up only the code types that fit your needs. You can use the codes together in any combination to track fixed assets in the <STRONG>Fixed assets</STRONG> form.</P>



1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Setup** \> **Asset activity codes**.

2.  Click **New** to create an asset activity code.

3.  Enter a unique asset activity code, such as Construct.

4.  Enter a description of the activity, such as Construction.

5.  Repeat steps 2 through 4 for each additional asset activity code.
