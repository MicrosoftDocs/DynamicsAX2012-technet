# (RUS) Expense and revenue codes [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_


> [!NOTE]

When organizing a tax register, one of the most important tasks is to identify the company's expenses and revenue and classify them in the format required by the Tax Code of the Russian Federation. If information is not properly classified, you cannot generate registers and calculate the tax base automatically.

In most cases, you can identify revenue and expenses from their corresponding transaction in the accounts. However, if the chart of accounts is insufficiently itemized, you will require supplementary identification of actual revenue and expenses. For this reason, it is important to use a specially denoted financial dimension.

Microsoft Dynamics AX contains a directory of revenue and expenses in a hierarchy structure that is synchronized with the financial tax dimension. This allows you to:

  - Group revenue and expenses in accordance with legislation.

  - Receive on-account totals grouped by revenue and expenses.

  - Simplify user procedures.

  - Set up the tax registers.
