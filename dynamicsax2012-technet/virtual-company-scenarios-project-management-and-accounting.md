_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_


> [!IMPORTANT]
> <P>The functionality described in this topic is available only if Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 or Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 is installed.</P>



This topic describes the table collections that must be set up to support some common virtual company scenarios in the Project management and accounting module of Microsoft Dynamics AX. The first table in each list is the base table of the table collection. Other tables in the list are referenced by the base table.

For an overview of the concept of virtual companies, and for step-by-step instructions to create table collections and virtual company accounts, see [Virtual company accounts in Microsoft Dynamics AX](virtual-company-accounts-in-microsoft-dynamics-ax.md).

If you use Microsoft Project Server integration, virtual companies are not supported. You canâ€™t enable Project Server integration for a virtual company.
