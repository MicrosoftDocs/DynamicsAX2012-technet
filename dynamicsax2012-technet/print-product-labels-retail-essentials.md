# Print product labels (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to generate and print product labels that you can attach to a product or a container. A product label contains all the information about the product, such as the batch number, serial number, and expiration date.

In Retail essentials, you can select a specific size for the product label reports that you print.

When you work with product labels in Retail essentials, you can complete the following tasks:

  - Create labels for products for which the price or comparison price has changed in a store.
    
    To set up Retail essentials to create product labels when prices change, you must assign product label reports to the relevant retail products. The product label reports provide the information that Retail essentials requires to print the labels. You must set up product label reports regardless of the version of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 that you are using. For more information about how to assign label reports to products, see [Set up retail products (Retail essentials)](set-up-retail-products-retail-essentials.md).

  - Create product labels manually, either for one product at a time or for categories of retail products.

  - Generate product labels for multiple products at the same time. You can also generate product labels for products that are included in purchase orders or transfer orders, and for released products.

  - Select a specific size for the product labels that you print.

  - Reprint labels at any time.

## Prerequisites

Before you can generate and print product labels, you must set up Microsoft Dynamics AX to enable label printing. The following tasks must be completed:

  - Before you can set up printing for product labels, a system administrator must enable three menu items for Retail essentials. For more information, see Enable label printing (Retail essentials).

  - Select options in the **Retail shared parameters** form to specify how labels should be generated for brick-and-mortar stores. For more information about the options in this form, see [Retail shared parameters (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh580625\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Select the reports that can be used to generate labels. The label reports contain information such as bar codes, prices, and relevant dates. Additionally, the label reports specify the size of the labels to print and the orientation of the label page. After label reports are set up in this step, users select which report to use every time that they generate labels.

## Specify which stores to print product labels for

Follow these steps to specify which stores to print labels for. You can select whether to generate labels for all stores or only selected stores. This setting applies to brick-and-mortar stores only.

2.  In the **Retail shared parameters** form, on the **Labels** tab, select the option to use when labels are generated.
