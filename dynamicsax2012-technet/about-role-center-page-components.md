# About Role Center page components [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

By default, Role Center pages typically include the following types of Web parts. Web parts are the individual pieces that display information on the page.

## Action Pane

The Action Pane in Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX resembles the Action Pane in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client. The Action Pane is divided into tabs that may contain button groups. Each button group may contain action buttons. Each action button can be used to open another page, add records to list pages, or perform common tasks for a selected record. For example, you can create a new sales order for a customer by clicking an action button.

## Quick links

Quick links Web parts display links that are relevant to users in your role. The links provide access to pages, reports, and other Web sites that you frequently use. You can modify these links to meet your needs. For more information, see [Manage quick links (Enterprise Portal)](manage-quick-links-enterprise-portal.md).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you are accessing your Role Center from the Microsoft Dynamics AX client, you can also add links that provide access to Microsoft Dynamics AX forms.</P>



## Cues

Cues Web parts display a visual representation of your workload. Cues also provide an overview of your remaining work items, such as sales leads or overdue activities, and other tasks that you must finish. You can select which Cues are displayed. Cues are filtered views of page information that have been saved. When you click a Cue, the associated page opens. For more information, see [Manage cues (Enterprise Portal)](manage-cues-enterprise-portal.md).

## Work lists

Work lists display alerts, Workflow work items, and activities that you can perform, or that you must be notified about. You can use the work list to view the status of these items, and to see when action is required. When you right-click an item in the work list, a list of available actions is displayed. This list also includes a link to the page where the item originated. For more information, see [Manage and use work lists (Enterprise Portal)](manage-and-use-work-lists-enterprise-portal.md).

## Reports and lists of key performance indicators (KPIs)

Reports Web parts display reports for Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services. These Web parts also include charts that display Microsoft Dynamics AX information. This information can come either from the database or from online analytical processing (OLAP) cubes that are set up in SQL Server Analysis Services. You can also use these Web parts to display lists of key performance indicators (KPIs). KPIs are business metrics that can be summarized as a comparison, goal, value, and status. For example, you can use KPIs to compare actual expenditures with budgeted amounts. For more information about reports and other business intelligence features, see [Reports (Enterprise Portal)](reports-enterprise-portal.md). For information about how to specify which report or KPI information is displayed, see [Manage reports](manage-reports.md).

## Business overviews

You can use business overview Web parts to display measures, or calculations, from OLAP cubes, and to compare those measures for various periods. You can also display KPIs that include information about period comparisons. For example, you can use these Web parts to display information about this month's sales versus last month's sales. For more information, see [Manage business overview information](manage-business-overview-information.md).

## FactBoxes

FactBoxes display information that is related to a selected record, or information that is displayed in a form or on a list page. For example, if you click a customer name on a list page, a FactBox for the selected customer appears in the right pane. You can customize FactBoxes on Enterprise Portal pages by expanding or closing FactBox parts.
