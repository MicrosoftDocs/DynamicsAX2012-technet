You can use Enterprise Portal to order items online. You can use different methods to add items to your shopping cart. This topic deals with how to add items to your shopping cart.

  - Use the **Product catalog** page to begin viewing items, and then add items to your shopping cart from this page. Alternatively, you can use the **Campaign items** page to view and add items to your shopping cart.

  - Use the **Shopping card** page to create order lines for the items that are listed on the **Product catalog** and **Campaign items** pages. You can then add the items to the cart.

## Add items via Product catalog or via Campaign items

1.  Click **Product catalog** or **Campaign items** on the Quick Launch. The **Product catalog** or **Campaign items** page is displayed, where you can view the available product groups in the catalog. For more information, see [View catalog and campaign items](view-catalog-and-campaign-items.md).

2.  Click a product group, and any subgroups, if it is required. When you reach the lowest level of the group structure, the **View product details** page is displayed. On this page, you can view the item ID and the product name and also the list price of each item before you add it to your shopping cart.

3.  Click the **Add to cart** button to add an item to your shopping cart. A message is displayed that the item is added to your cart. If a product has product variants, these product variants are listed. Select a variant and enter a quantity in the **Quantity** field if you want to add variants to the shopping cart, and then click the **Add to cart** button.

4.  Repeat step 3 to add more items from the selected product group, or repeat steps 2 and 3 to view and add another product group for other items.
