# (IND) Generate 26Q or 27Q quarterly statements for TDS 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

The deductors of tax at source can use the following two quarterly statements for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS):

  - **Form 26Q** – Quarterly statement of TDS generated for all payments other than salaries for residents.

  - **Form 27Q** – Quarterly statement of TDS generated for interest, dividend, or any other amount payable for nonresidents.

Form 26Q and Form 27Q statements display the following information:

  - TAN, PAN, assessment year, and details about statements that were previously filed.

  - Specific information about the deductor of tax at source. For more information, see [(IND) Key tasks: Tax information for legal entities](ind-key-tasks-tax-information-for-legal-entities.md).

  - Information about the person who is responsible for deducting taxes.

  - Details of taxes that are deducted and paid to the credit of Central Government.

  - Annexure with details of amounts paid and tax deducted from the deductees.

  - Verification section.

Form 26Q statement is generated for transactions with a **Resident** status, and Form 27Q is generated for transactions with a **Non-resident** status. The status is attached to the withholding tax component group. To view the status, open the **Withholding tax component groups** form. Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **Withholding tax** \> **India** \> **Withholding tax component groups**.

The statements are generated for TDS transactions that are posted to payable accounts that are defined for TDS tax codes.

The following prerequisites are required to generate Form 26Q statements:

  - In the **Tax information** area of the **Legal entities** form, enter the Permanent Account Number (PAN) and withholding tax information.

  - In the **Withholding tax component groups** form, enter the section codes for all withholding tax component groups associated with TDS transactions that are posted for the period.

  - In the **Withholding tax codes** form, set up the reporting codes for the withholding tax components that are used for the TDS transactions that are posted for the period.

  - Enter the challan details for all TDS transactions that are posted for the period. For more information, see [(IND) Challan information (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj677847\(v=ax.60\)).
