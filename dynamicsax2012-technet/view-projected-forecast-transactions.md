# View projected forecast transactions 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can view projected inventory transactions that originated from a forecast. You may want to view these transactions when, for example, a forecast line specifies a total transaction amount instead of an item quantity. In this situation, one forecast line can produce several inventory forecast lines.

1.  Click **Inventory management** \> **Inquiries** \> **Forecast**, and then click **Supply forecast** or **Demand forecast** to open an existing forecast.

2.  Click **Inventory forecast** to open the **Inventory forecast** form.
    
    Each inventory forecast line shows the effect that the transaction has on inventory quantity. The program uses inventory forecast lines to calculate gross requirements during forecast scheduling.
