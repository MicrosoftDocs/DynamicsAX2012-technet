# About intercompany expenses 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

A worker who is employed by one legal entity in an organization might perform work for another legal entity in the same organization. In this situation, you can use the intercompany expense feature to assign the workerâ€™s expenses to the legal entity for which the work was performed. The legal entity that employs the worker is called the *loaning legal entity*. The legal entity for which the worker incurs expenses is called the *borrowing legal entity*.

Before a worker can create and submit expenses for work that is performed for a different legal entity, the following procedure must be completed in the loaning legal entity.

1.  Click **Travel and expense** \> **Setup** \> **Travel and expense parameters**.

2.  In the left pane, click **General**, and then select the **Allow intercompany expense lines** check box.
