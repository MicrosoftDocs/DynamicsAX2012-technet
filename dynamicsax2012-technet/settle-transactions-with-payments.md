# Settle transactions with payments 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

If a payment was entered and posted, but not yet settled with an invoice or other transaction, you can settle the payment and invoice by opening the **Settle open transactions** form from the **Customers** or **Vendors** forms.

When you click the **Update** button, the selected payment and invoice transactions are settled. If the payment and invoice transactions are in the same legal entity, the transactions change status according to the following rules:

  - If an invoice is not settled in full, it remains open.

  - If the amount paid is greater than the amount due, the invoice is settled and closed. The payment transaction for the customer remains open for the amount by which the payment exceeds the amount due.

  - If the payment amount is less than the amount due, the payment amount is subtracted from the amount due, and the invoice remains open. The payment transaction is fully settled and is closed.

  - If the amount paid equals the amount due, the payment and invoice transactions are closed.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>(FRA) Invoice holds are available to French public sector entities. If a hold is placed on an invoice, the invoice cannot be settled until either the hold is removed or the time period for the hold has passed. For more information, see <A href="fra-place-or-release-vendor-invoice-payment-holds-public-sector.md">(FRA) Place or release vendor invoice payment holds (Public sector)</A>.</P>
