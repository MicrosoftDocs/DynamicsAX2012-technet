Financial statements use row definitions and column definitions to present information about the financial status of a business at specific point in time, and to list revenues, expenses, and income.

Management Reporter lets you design financial reports based on ledger accounts and financial dimensions, drill down to transaction-level detail, and use web-based report viewing.
