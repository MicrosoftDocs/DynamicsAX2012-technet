# (FRA) Key tasks: Titres de recette and bordereaux de titre (Public sector) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The titre de recette is used by the director to notify the accountant that the organization is entitled to collect a specific amount from another entity, and to authorize the accountant to pay that amount. The director or the accountant may delegate a representative to perform the task, but the responsibility for each task remains with the director or the accountant.

A group of related titres, together with all supporting documentation, are assigned to a bordereau de titre for submittal to the accountant.

## Director: Assign invoice lines to titres

When a free text invoice is created, the director approves or certifies that the goods or services were provided and gathers the necessary supporting documentation. Once everything is in order, the director assigns each invoice line to a titre.

For certain expenses, the accountant may receive a payment before receiving a titre, and the director will regularize the receipt by issuing a titre afterward. This behavior may occur for certain recurrent receipts, such as rent. It may also occur when money is collected by a régisseur.

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Periodic** \> **Maintain titres de recette (France)**.

2.  To retrieve invoice lines for which the payment has not yet been received, in the **Invoice status** group, click **Pending**.
    
    –or–
    
    To retrieve invoice lines for which the payment has already been received, in the **Invoice status** group, click **Posted**.

3.  In the **From date** field, enter the first date in the range of dates that you want to select invoices from. In the **To date** field, enter the last date in the range of dates. Invoices that were created within this range will be reviewed to determine whether they meet the selected criteria.

4.  Click **Retrieve lines** to open a database inquiry form.

5.  On the inquiry form, enter the criteria to find the invoices that you want to assign to titres. In most cases, you will select a customer account for the **Invoice accounts** field and leave the remaining criteria blank.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>To find the invoice lines from titres that were rejected by the accountant, select <STRONG>Not reviewed</STRONG> for the <STRONG>Director authorization status</STRONG> and <STRONG>Rejected</STRONG> for the <STRONG>Accountant acceptance status</STRONG>. Do not enter a titre number. The titre number and bordereau de titre number are removed when the accountant rejects the titre.</P>



6.  Click **OK** to close the inquiry form. All invoice lines that match the invoice status, dates, and selection criteria that you entered will appear in the grid.

7.  Click the **Titre** column heading to sort the invoice lines by titre number. All the invoice lines that are not assigned to a titre will appear at the top of the column.

8.  Select the check box at the start of each line that you want to assign to a titre.

9.  Click **Assign to titre**. Each line that you selected is assigned to a titre.
