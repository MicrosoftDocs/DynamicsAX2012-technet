# (RUS) Set up a calculation sequence 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

A calculation sequence is a set of counters that performs a sequence of mathematical and logical operations on register lines of designated types for a specified period. Counters perform the calculation algorithms described in certain types of lines. The following table provides details that describe the counter lines.

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **Profit tax** \> **Sequence of calculation**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a new line.

3.  In the **Sequence** field, enter the sequence number.

4.  In the **Description** field, enter a description of the calculation sequence.

5.  In the **Channel** field, select the output format for the calculation results from the following options:
    
      - **Register** – Calculation results are recorded in tax registers.
    
      - **Deferral** – Deferral cards are created from the calculation results.

6.  In the **Channel reference** field, select the register code or the deferrals group where you want to record the calculation results.

7.  Click **Counters** to open the **Counter setup** form, and then create counters for the calculation sequences.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>For each calculation sequence, you can define one or more counters. However, you can create only one counter for each expense code and calculation sequence.</P>



8.  Press CTRL+S or close the form.
