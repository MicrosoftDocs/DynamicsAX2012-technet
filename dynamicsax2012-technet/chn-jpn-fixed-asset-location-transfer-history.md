# (CHN, JPN) Fixed asset location transfer history 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

When you transfer a fixed asset from one location to another within the same company, Microsoft Dynamics AX records the transfer details to ensure accurate fixed asset reporting.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic does not apply to versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 prior to cumulative update 6 for AX 2012 R2.</P>



## What is the purpose of tracking the transfer of a fixed asset to a location?

The location of a fixed asset, including any transfers, must be tracked, and then reported in the GB/T 24589 XML file. This XML file can then be processed by using the GB/T 24589 system of accounting.
