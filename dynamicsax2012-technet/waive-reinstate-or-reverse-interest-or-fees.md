# Waive, reinstate, or reverse interest or fees 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When interest notes are created, you sometimes must make adjustments to the interest and fees that they include. You can use the buttons on the **Collect** tab of the **All customers** list page to waive, reverse, or reinstate charges:

  - Waived charges are forgiven. You might waive a charge if, for example, a customer disputes the charge, and you want to maintain a good business relationship with the customer.

  - Reinstated charges become due again. You can reinstate charges that were previously waived. This is sometimes necessary if you decide that charges should not have been waived.

  - Reversed charges are removed from a customer’s account, and are no longer due. You might reverse charges if, for example, the wrong interest rate was selected to calculate the amount that a customer owes. You can use a separate process to recalculate interest and create an interest note with new charges for the customer.

All of these actions change an interest note, which is the business document that informs a customer when interest or fees have been charged to their account. When you waive or reverse interest or fees, a credit note or adjustment invoice is automatically created to settle the charges. If you reinstate waived charges, an invoice with a debit amount is automatically created to reinstate the charges that the customer owes. The following information describes the results of each action.

<p>If the amount of the credit note exceeds what the customer owes, you can convert the credit note to a vendor invoice. You can then give a refund to the customer. For more information, see <a href="reimburse-customers.md">Reimburse customers</a>.</p></td>

<td><p>An invoice with a debit amount is created, and the amount is automatically settled against the charges that were previously waived. The actual interest notes are not reinstated. Instead, an invoice is created that shows the amount that is due from the customer.</p>
<p>The credit notes, or adjustment invoices, that were created to settle waived interest notes can still exist if they were not used to settle the interest notes. When this occurs, the outstanding credit notes are canceled. Outstanding credit notes are usually automatically settled when interest notes are waived.

> [!NOTE]

## Adjust interest for invoices

In addition to adjusting interest notes, you can also remove interest charges on invoices using one of the following processes. Both processes also make adjustments to the related interest notes:

## Correct an invoice with associated interest

You can use this process to correct a posted invoice that is included in an interest note. The invoice is canceled and a new one is created. Interest on the transaction is also reversed on the interest note, if the interest note was posted. For more information, see [Correct a posted free text invoice](correct-a-posted-free-text-invoice.md).


> [!TIP]
> <P>This process copies the details from the existing invoice to a new one to make only the corrections you want.</P>



1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Free text invoices** \> **All free text invoices**.

2.  Select the invoice to correct.

3.  On the Action Pane, click **Correct invoice**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>This button is available only if the <STRONG>Free text invoice correction</STRONG> configuration key is selected.</P>



4.  Select a reason code and enter the canceled date for the invoice.

5.  Click **Create corrected invoice**. The **Free text invoice** form is displayed.

6.  Make any changes to the invoice.

7.  On the Action Pane, click **Post**.

8.  Click **OK** to post the invoice.

9.  Click **Continue**.

## Reverse a customer transaction with associated interest

You can use this process to reverse a customer transaction on an invoice, when an invoice was created incorrectly. If the reversed customer transaction has interest included on an interest note, and the interest note was posted, interest on the transaction is also reversed on the interest note. The interest note is canceled if it has not been posted. For more information, see [Reverse a transaction](reverse-a-transaction.md).


> [!TIP]
> <P>After using this process, you can review the original and corrected invoices on the <STRONG>Overview</STRONG> tab of the <STRONG>Customer transactions</STRONG> form.</P>



1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Customers** \> **All customers**.

2.  Select a customer account.

3.  On the Action Pane, on the **Customer** tab, click **Transactions**.

4.  Select the invoice to reverse.

5.  Click **Reverse transaction**.

6.  Select a reason code and enter the posting date for the reversal.

7.  Click **OK**.

## Waive or reinstate interest notes

You can waive or reinstate all of the charges on the interest notes that you select. When you waive charges, the total amount to be waived cannot exceed any amount limits that have been set. For more information, see [Manage customer waive limits (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh209728\(v=ax.60\)). You can reinstate an interest note only if it was previously waived.

For more information, see [Manage customer waive limits (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh209728\(v=ax.60\)). You can reinstate an interest transaction only if it was previously waived.
