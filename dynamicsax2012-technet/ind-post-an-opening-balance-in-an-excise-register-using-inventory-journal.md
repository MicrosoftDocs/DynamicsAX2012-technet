# (IND) Post an opening balance in an excise register using inventory journal 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use the movement journal to post the opening balance of the quantity of excisable goods in the RG register.

Example:

A line in the movement journal is created for an item with the following details:

  - Cost price: 100.00

  - Quantity: 10

  - Amount: 1000.00

  - Excise record type: RG23A

When the movement journal is posted, the RG23A Part I register is updated with the inward quantity, which is 10.00.
