# (RUS) Set up an RCOAD code for a vendor 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use the **Vendors** form to set up a Russian Classification of Objects of Administrative Division (RCOAD) code for a vendor that is associated with a separate division of the company other than the head office. If a vendor is associated with a company division other than the head office, you must enter an RCOAD code for the vendor. An RCOAD code is a legislative or territorial code that is defined for each region or territory of the Russian Federation. These codes are specified in the company registration documents and are defined based on the location of the companyâ€™s separate division.

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Common** \> **Vendors** \> **All vendors**. Click **Vendor**.

2.  Create a vendor and then enter the required details, or double-click a vendor record. For more information, see [Create a vendor account](create-a-vendor-account.md).

3.  Click the **Addresses** FastTab, and then click **Add**.

4.  In the **New address** form, enter the address details of the vendor.

5.  Click the **Tax registration** FastTab, and then click **Add**.

6.  In the **Registration type** field, select the type of tax registration that you set up for RCOAD codes in the **Tax registration types** form.

7.  In the **Registration number** field, enter the RCOAD code for the vendor.
