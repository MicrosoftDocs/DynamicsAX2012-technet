# Create or edit a return order

You can use the **New return order** page to create return orders for customers who return items that they have purchased. For example, a customer might return items if the incorrect item was received, or if an item is defective. You must create a return order for returned items before the items can be received into the warehouse.

You can use the **Edit return order** page to edit a return order. You can add lines to a return order only if no lines have yet been received.

## Create a return order

2.  Select the customer to create a return order for.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Sell** tab, in the **New** group, click **Return Order**.

4.  On the **Customer** FastTab, enter or select invoice information, such as the invoice account, currency, and language. You also can select a reason code for the return.

5.  On the **Lines** FastTab, click **Add line** to add a line item to the return order.

6.  Select an item and inventory dimension information, if necessary.

7.  Enter the quantity of the item that is being returned and click the **Insert** icon for the line.

8.  On the **Delivery address** FastTab, you can enter or modify the delivery address details.

9.  Repeat steps 5 through 7 to add more items to the return order.

10. Click **Save and close** to create the return order and return to the customer list.
