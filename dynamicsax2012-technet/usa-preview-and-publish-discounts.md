# (USA) Preview and publish discounts 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Before you publish discounts to online media, such as Facebook and Twitter, you can preview the webpages on Sites Services for Microsoft Dynamics ERP that display the discounts online.

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Common** \> **Campaigns** \> **All campaigns**.

2.  Double-click the campaign that you want to preview and publish, and then, on the **Action Pane**, on the **Campaign** tab, click **Edit**.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **General** tab, in the **Promotions** group, click **Publish**.

4.  In the **Publish promotions** form, in the **Media type** column, select **Facebook** or **Twitter**.

5.  On the **Available promotion pages** FastTab, select the **Publish pages to Sites Services** check box.

6.  Wait until the page is published on Sites Services. Publishing occurs at specific intervals, and therefore might take several minutes.

7.  Click **Refresh** to view the URL for the discount.

8.  If you are publishing to Facebook, enter information in the following fields:
    
      - To post a message about the discount to the Facebook Wall, enter the message in the **Wall post message** field.
    
      - In the **Wall post title** field, enter a title for the Wall post.
    
      - In the **Wall post title URL** field, select **Use a promotion page**.
    
      - In the **Wall post subtitle** field, enter a subtitle for the Wall post.
    
      - In the **Wall post subtitle** field, enter any text to display in the Wall post.

9.  If you want to publish an image together with the discount, on the **Media content** FastTab, click **Image**, and then select the image.

10. In the **Promotion page** field, select a page template. Each template uses a different page layout and image size.

11. To preview the webpage, select the check box next to the URL of the webpage, and then click **Open in browser**.

12. On the **Media content** FastTab, click **Publish**.
    
    Microsoft Dynamics AX posts the promotion on Facebook or Twitter. The promotion includes a link to the promotion page that has been published on Sites Services.
