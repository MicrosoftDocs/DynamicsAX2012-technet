# View project validation 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Validation in Microsoft Dynamics AX projects means creating associations among workers, projects, and categories for access control. For instance, you can create associations between a group of workers and a particular project, and between that project and certain categories. This ensures that only the workers in that group enter hours for the project, and that they enter hours that are associated with only those categories that you assigned to it.

Use the **Project validation worker assignments** page and **Project validation category assignments** page to view the validation assignments that have been created in a project for workers and categories.

1.  Click **Project management** on the top link bar, and then in the **Project name** column, click the project that you want to work with.

2.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Plan** tab, in the **Validation** group, click **View worker assignments** or **View category assignments**.
