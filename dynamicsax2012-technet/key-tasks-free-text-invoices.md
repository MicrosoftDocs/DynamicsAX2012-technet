# Key tasks: Free text invoices 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A free text invoice is an invoice that is not attached to a sales order. A free text invoice contains a header and one or more lines for items or services that are not tracked in inventory. Use a free text invoice for sales that do not require a sales order, packing slip, and customer invoice. For example, you can use a free text invoice for a consulting fee or services fee, or for a miscellaneous fee for an event reimbursement.
