# Set up Microsoft Outlook or Exchange Server integration 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Before users can integrate Microsoft Outlook or Microsoft Exchange Server with Microsoft Dynamics AX on a client computer, they must be granted access to the COM+ Service. When Microsoft Dynamics AX is installed on the client computer, the user who installed the program is automatically granted access to the COM+ Service, but other users must be added manually.

Before you can integrate the two programs for a user, you must add each user of that client computer who plans to enable the integration of Outlook or Exchange Server with Microsoft Dynamics AX to the COM+ Service.

Support for integration with Microsoft Exchange Server is available only in AX 2012 R3 Cumulative Update 8 and later.

## Add a user to the COM+ Service

1.  Click **Start** \> **Administrative tools**, and then double-click **Component services**.

2.  On the **Component services** page, expand the nodes **Computers** \> **My computer** \> **COM+ Applications**.

3.  Locate and expand either the **DynamicsMAPI** node or the **DynamicsMAPI32** node.

4.  Right-click **Roles**, and then click **New** \> **Role**.

5.  Enter a role name, such as **Non-admin** or **Other users**, for the users whom you are adding to the COM+ Service, and then click **OK**.

6.  Expand the role that you created, right-click the **Users** folder, and then click **New** \> **User**.

7.  Enter the names of the users whom you are adding to the COM+ Service, and then click **Check Names** to validate the names that you entered.

8.  After you enter all of the user names, close the window, and then restart Microsoft Dynamics AX.
