_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Your vendor profile in the Vendor portal contains critical contact and banking information that your customer uses to communicate with you. Use this procedure to view or modify the information in your company profile.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Inaccurate banking information for your company can cause delayed payments for items or services. Before you update banking information, confirm the changes with your accounting department.</P>



The level of access to the vendor profile on the Vendor portal is determined by user role:

  - Users with **Vendor (external)** rights can view and modify the company profile.

  - Users with **Vendor portal administrator (external)** rights can view the company profile but cannot modify it.

### Update your company profile

1.  Click **Profile** on the Quick Launch.

2.  On the **Profile** page, click **Edit**.

3.  Change the information as necessary, and then click **Save and close**.
