# (CHN) Configure tax integration 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Before you export value-added tax (VAT) customer invoices or import VAT customer invoice reference numbers, you must configure tax integration. Follow the steps in this topic to configure Microsoft Dynamics AX for tax integration.

## This task is part of a bigger process

The following illustration shows how the configuration of tax integration relates to other tax integration tasks.

For an overview of the process, see [(CHN) Chinese tax integration for VAT customer invoices](chn-chinese-tax-integration-for-vat-customer-invoices.md).

## 1\. Set up a tax integration profile

Use the **Tax integration profiles** form to set up a tax integration profile to use for VAT customer invoices. You can specify the maximum amount for a VAT customer document.

To set up a tax integration profile, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Tax integration** \> **Tax integration profiles**.

2.  Select or create a tax integration profile, and then set up the inbound and outbound ports for the tax integration profile. For more information, see [(CHN) Tax integration profiles (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj664013\(v=ax.60\)).

3.  In the **Sales tax code** field, select a sales tax code for the tax integration profile. The sales tax code that you select is used to group and combine the invoices. The sales tax code also determines whether a customer invoice is integrated with the external invoice system and whether it will be exported.

4.  In the **Maximum invoice amount** field, enter the maximum amount limit for a VAT customer document that you export.

5.  In the **Maximum invoice lines** field, enter the maximum number of lines that can be included on a VAT customer document that you export.

6.  In AX 2012 R3 and cumulative update 6 or later for AX 2012 R2: Perform the following steps.
    
    1.  Select the **Validate amount limit** check box to post only the invoices that have a total amount that is lower than the amount that you specify in the **Maximum invoice amount** field.
    
    2.  Select the **Split during posting** check box to split invoices that have a total amount that exceeds the amount that you specify in the **Maximum invoice amount** field before you post the invoice. You can select this check box only if you select the **Validate amount limit** check box.
    
    3.  In the **Invoice auditor** field, select the name of the person who audits the invoices.
    
    4.  In the **Payment collector** field, select the name of the person who collects the invoice payments.
    
    5.  On the **Default value of description and unit** FastTab, perform the following steps for each source document that you export using the tax integration profile:
        
        1.  Click **New** to create a record.
        
        2.  In the **Name** field, select the source document to export.
        
        3.  In the **Description** field, enter the default description for the export file.
        
        4.  In the **Unit** field, select the default unit for the export file.
