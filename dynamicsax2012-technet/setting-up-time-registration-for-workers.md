# Setting up time registration for workers 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Workers must be set up as time registration workers to be able to make registrations by using the time and attendance or manufacturing execution functionality.

Time and attendance can be used to make registrations such as clock-in and clock-out registrations on indirect activities, and absence registrations. Workers can use manufacturing execution to register time and item consumption on production jobs or projects.
