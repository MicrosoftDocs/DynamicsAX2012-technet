## 1\. Set up parameters for salary payments

Use the **Salary payment setup** form to set up parameters for salary payments and payments that are made in the middle of a period for employees. You can set up parameters for cash payments, bank payments, and deposits.

To set up parameters for salary payments, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Salary payment** \> **Setup** \> **Setup**.

2.  In the **Petty cash** area, in the **Name** field, select the name of the journal that is used to register cash payment slips.

3.  In the **Cash** field, select a cash account to make payments to.

4.  Select the **Automatic** check box to post the cash transaction to the general ledger automatically.

5.  In the **Default financial dimensions** field group, set up the financial dimension codes for cash payments.

6.  Click **Bank**, and then in the **Bank** area, in the **Name** field, select the name of the bank transaction journal. You can select a journal of type **Daily** in this field.

7.  Select the **Automatic** check box to post the bank transaction to the general ledger automatically.

8.  In the **Account type** and **Account** fields, select the account type and account code for the bank payments.

9.  In the **Default financial dimensions** field group, set up the financial dimension codes for the bank payments.

10. Click **Deposit**, and then in the **Deposit** area, in the **Corr. account for deposit** field group, in the **Account type** field, the account type is updated to **Ledger**. An account of type **Ledger** is used to record the liabilities of a legal entity to employees. In the **Account** field, select a ledger account code for the deposits.

11. In the **Pay type** field, select the pay type for the accounting of deposited amounts when a deposit that is not received by an employee is closed using payroll.

12. In the **Against profit** field group, in the **Account type** field, the account type is updated to **Ledger**. An account of type **Ledger** is used when a deposit that is not received by an employee is written off against profit on maturity of the deposited amount. In the **Account** field, select a ledger account code.

## 2\. Set up payroll journal names

Use the **Setup payroll journals** form to set up journal names for payroll. Journal names are used to categorize the registered vouchers. For example, you can set up a journal name to accrue bonuses by March 8 of each year, or to accrue the annual bonus for the top managers of a legal entity.

To set up payroll journal names, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Calculation procedures** \> **Payroll journal** \> **Journal names**.

2.  In the **Name** field, enter a payroll journal name.

3.  In the **Description** field, enter a description for the payroll journal.

4.  Select the **Delete lines after posting** check box to delete the journal lines after you post the journal.

5.  Select the **Use rate value per employee** check box to use the date effective rate values that you specified for each employee or group in the **Value** field on the **Overview** tab in the **Set up rate values** form for each journal line. If you clear this check box, the default rate value that you specified in the **Value** field on the **Value** tab in the **Rates** form is used for all of the employees or groups in all of the journal lines.

6.  In the **Private for user group** field, select a user group to provide private access to the journal name.

## 3\. Set up standard deduction parameters

Use the **Standard deduction calculation settings** form to set up parameters for standard deductions, and use the **Standard deductions** form to set up codes that are used for standard deductions. Standard deductions refer to all deductions from the paycheck of an employee, excluding individual income tax. Deductions from the wages and other incomes of an employee are calculated based on the amount that is to be paid after the individual income tax is deducted.

To set up standard deduction parameters that are used as default values for the attributes that are used to register employees’ liabilities, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Calculation procedures** \> **Standard deductions** \> **Setup** \> **General settings**.

2.  In the **Amount to pay** field, select the basis to calculate the amount of pay. For more information about the basis of calculation and how to set up the basis of calculation, see “7. Set up off-budget and labor remuneration funds” in [(RUS) Set up parameters for the payroll process](rus-set-up-parameters-for-the-payroll-process.md).

3.  In the **Maximum deduction percentage** field, select the rate that contains the percentage that is used to calculate the maximum amount of deductions from the employee’s pay that you specify in the **Amount to pay** field.

4.  In the **Sequence** field, select the sequence to calculate the deduction amount for alimony postage charges. Close the form.

5.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Calculation procedures** \> **Standard deductions** \> **Setup** \> **Deduction codes**.

6.  Click **New** or press CTRL+N to create a deduction code, and then specify the type, code, and name of the deduction.
