# Settle a postdated check from a customer

Use the **Customer postdated checks** form to settle postdated checks received from a customer. You can settle a postdated check after the check has been cleared by the bank.

You must select the **Post journal entries for postdated checks** check box in the **Cash and bank management parameters** form when you settle a postdated check.

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Postdated checks** \> **Customer postdated checks**.

2.  Click **Checks to send to bank** to list postdated checks that have reached their maturity dates.

3.  Select a check that is cleared by the bank, and then click **Settle clearing entries** to settle the customer account for the check transaction.

4.  Close the form to save your changes.
