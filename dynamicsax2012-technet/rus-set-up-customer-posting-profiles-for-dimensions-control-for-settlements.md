4.  In the **Allow empty dimension value** field, select the condition under which customer transaction settlements can be processed if dimension values are not specified. The following options are available:
    
      - **No** – Transactions are not settled, whether the dimension values are specified or not.
    
      - **Auto** - Automatic transactions are settled, whether the dimension values are specified or not.
    
      - **Manual** – Manual transactions are settled, whether the dimension values are specified or not.
    
      - **Always** – All transactions are settled, whether the dimension values are specified or not.
