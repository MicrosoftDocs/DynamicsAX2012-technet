# Create or modify an opportunity record 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can create lead records to help your sales and marketing teams gather and store information about a lead. For more information, see [Create or modify a lead record](create-or-modify-a-lead-record.md). When leads are qualified, they become opportunities.

You can track additional sales-related information for opportunities, such as quotations and competitors for the sale. You can also specify probability percentages and prognosis ratings to track the probability percentage, which is the likelihood that an opportunity will result in a sale.

After you provide sales quotations and the contact for the opportunity makes a decision, you can track whether you won the opportunity and any reasons for the win. If you lose the opportunity, you can list why and to which competitor you lost it.
