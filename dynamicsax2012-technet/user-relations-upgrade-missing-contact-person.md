# User relations upgrade missing contact person 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Users can be internal, such as employees, or external, such as vendors, customers, or prospects. After you specify user relations, a userâ€™s information (such as employee ID or customer account ID) is automatically displayed in fields when that user opens an Enterprise Portal page. For external relations, data is trimmed on the vendor self-service portal according to account access. For example, if a user has an external relation for vendor account 1003, the user only sees data for that account in the vendor self-service portal.

Use this form to resolve issues when a user relation is not assigned a contact representative in your business or organization.

## Specify a contact for a user relation

1.  Click **User relations upgrade missing**.

2.  Select a user in the list and then click **User relations**.

3.  Click the **General** tab.

4.  Use the **Contact** person drop-down list to select a contact representative in your business or organization.
