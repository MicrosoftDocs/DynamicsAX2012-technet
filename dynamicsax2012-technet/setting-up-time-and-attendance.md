When you set up **Time and attendance**, follow these steps in the sequential order. Some steps may not be relevant, depending on the **Time and attendance** functionality that your company uses. You may have to repeat some of the tasks during the setup process.

3.  If you want to use **Manufacturing execution** features together with **Time and attendance**, you must set up integration with production:
