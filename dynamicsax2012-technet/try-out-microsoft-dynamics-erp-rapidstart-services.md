## Partners

Microsoft Dynamics Certified Partners can try RapidStart Services before they sign up their customers and prospects. Before a partner can use or enroll customers in RapidStart Services, someone from the partner organization must sign the Online Services Addendum (Schedule C) to the Solution Provider Agreement (SPA).

## Customers

As a Microsoft Dynamics AX customer or prospective customer, you can try RapidStart Services for 90 days. You don’t have to install anything. All you have to do is work with a Microsoft Dynamics Certified Partner, who can give you temporary access to RapidStart Services during the 90-day evaluation period.

If you are a customer, you can continue using RapidStart Services after 90 days if your Microsoft Dynamics Certified Partner associates your account in Customer Portal with your account number in the VOICE system.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Your customer organization must currently be on a Microsoft Dynamics Enhancement Plan to continue using RapidStart Services after 90 days.</P>
