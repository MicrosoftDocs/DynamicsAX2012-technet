# What's new: Products 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, new products can be defined and released to individual companies. Additionally, an item is now always based on a product definition. In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, you could create items without using a formalized definition process.

## Overview

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Required</p></td>
<td><p>Conditionally required. If you are using this feature in an earlier version of Microsoft Dynamics AX, significant changes have been made, and you must review this topic.</p></td>

## New functionality

A product definition level is added as a mandatory step in the process for creating items, and all items are now associated with a product definition.

## Special considerations

Items are based on product definitions. Therefore, product definitions are required for all items in AX 2012.

## Comparison with AX 2009

The inventory process has changed considerably since AX 2009. AX 2012 includes changes to the following areas:

  - Products and product variants

  - Product release

  - Product translations

  - New division of the inventory dimension group
