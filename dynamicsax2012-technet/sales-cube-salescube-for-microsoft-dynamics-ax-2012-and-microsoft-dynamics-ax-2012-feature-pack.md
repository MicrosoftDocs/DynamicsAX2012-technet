# Sales cube (SalesCube) for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 and Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use the Sales cube to report on sales transactions, specifically with regard to posting sales order invoices and sales order packing slips.

## Units of measure and reporting with the Sales cube

When working with Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services reports that display a quantity of an item, the appropriate unit of measure must be incorporated into the report to make sure that the quantity is correct, instead of just presenting a SUM value.

For example, the InventTrans.QTY field is expressed in the inventory unit of measure. The inventory unit of measure is stored in the InventTableModule table in Microsoft Dynamics AX for each item number. Each item number has three records with different values that represent the unit of measure (ModuleType): Sales, Inventory, and Purchase. For this purpose, use the UnitID where the ModuleType equals Inventory.

For the Quantity measure that uses the sales order unit of measure, slicing on the Units dimension separates the quantities by unit of measure.

## Configuration keys
