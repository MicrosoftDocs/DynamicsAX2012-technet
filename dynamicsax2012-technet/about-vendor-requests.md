# About vendor requests 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Vendors who are approved to do business with your organization are authorized to provide goods and services only in specific procurement categories and in specific legal entities. If you want to do business with a new vendor, or with a current vendor in additional procurement categories or legal entities, you must submit vendor requests.

You can submit the following types of vendor requests:

  - New vendor requests

  - Vendor extension requests

  - Vendor category extension requests

  - Vendor status change requests

You can attach supporting documents to a vendor request. Attachments can be either documents that are stored in Microsoft Dynamics AX or links to documents that are stored in another location. For more information, see [About attachments](about-attachments.md).

## New vendor requests

Submit a new vendor request to request that a new vendor be authorized to do business with your legal entity. Use this kind of request for a vendor company that is not already a vendor for any legal entity in the organization. The request is routed for approval, and you are notified when the request is approved or rejected.

**Example**

Benjamin, the marketing manager in legal entity CA1020 at Contoso, must work with a vendor company to build a Web-based marketing campaign. However, during the requisition process, Benjamin cannot find a Web-based marketing firm for his campaign. Benjamin knows that Fabrikam is the best provider of these services. Therefore, he lists Fabrikam as a suggested vendor on the purchase requisition. Then, in the Employee services portal, he submits a new vendor request to add Fabrikam to the list of approved vendors for his legal entity.

## Vendor extension requests

Submit a vendor extension request to request that a prospect, customer, or existing vendor be authorized to do business with your legal entity. Use this kind of request when the selected vendor, prospect, or customer is already a vendor for another legal entity in the organization.

**Example**

Michael, an administrative assistant, submits purchase requisitions for many legal entities in the organization. In the past, Michael has created purchase requisitions for legal entity CA1020 that specify Fabrikam as the vendor for marketing campaigns. However, when Michael creates a purchase requisition for a marketing campaign for US1010, he notices that Fabrikam is not an approved vendor for that legal entity. Therefore, he suggests Fabrikam as the vendor on the purchase requisition. Then, in the Employee services portal, he submits a vendor extension request to add Fabrikam as an approved vendor for legal entity US1010.

## Vendor category extension requests

Submit a vendor category extension request to request that a vendor be approved to do business in additional procurement categories. Use this kind of request for vendors who already do business with your legal entity.

**Example**

Fabrikam, a vendor, provides services for creating and tracking marketing campaigns. Fabrikam currently does business with Contoso in the "Advertising" procurement category. Benjamin, a marketing manager at Contoso, needs a vendor to create printed marketing materials. However, when he creates a purchase requisition, he notices that there are no approved vendors in the "Print media" procurement category. Benjamin knows that Fabrikam can provide the services that he needs. Therefore, in the Employee services portal, he submits a vendor category extension request to request that Fabrikam be extended to the "Print media" category for his legal entity at Contoso.

## Vendor status change requests

Submit a vendor status change request to request that the hold status be changed for a vendor who is authorized to do business with your legal entity.

**Example**

Benjamin, a marketing manager at Contoso, wants to work with Fabrikam, a vendor that specializes in Web-based marketing. In the Employee services portal, Benjamin tries to order services from Fabrikam. However, during the order process, he receives the following message: "The vendor is on hold." Benjamin cannot finish the order process. Therefore, he submits a vendor status change request to request that the hold status for Fabrikam be set to **No**. If the request is approved, Benjamin can complete the order process.
