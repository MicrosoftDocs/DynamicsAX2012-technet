# (IND) Calculate service tax for a foreign vendor 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use the **Purchase order** form to create and post an import purchase order. You can calculate the service tax on goods of type **Service** that you import from a foreign vendor.

The service tax fields are available only if you do the following:

  - Select the **Service tax** check box on the **Sales tax** tab in the **General ledger parameters** form.

  - Set up the vendor as a foreign vendor in the **Vendors** form. Click **Accounts payable** \> **Common** \> **Vendors** \> **All vendors**. Double-click a vendor account. In the **Vendors** form, on the **Tax information** FastTab, select the **Foreign vendor** check box.

<!-- end list -->

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Common** \> **Purchase orders** \> **All purchase orders**.

2.  Select or create a purchase order for a foreign vendor. For more information, see [(IND) Create import purchase orders](ind-create-import-purchase-orders.md).

3.  In the **Purchase order** form, on the **Action Pane**, in the **Maintain** group, click **Edit**.

4.  In the **Purchase order lines** area, select an item of type **Service**.

5.  On the **Line details** FastTab, on the **Tax information** tab, in the **Service** field group, the **Recoverable/Expense on tax settlement** check box is selected by default. A selected check box indicates that the service tax is posted to the recoverable account or expense account only when the tax is settled. You can clear the check box if a service tax is not applicable for the selected item.

6.  In the **Service code** field, select the service code that is attached to the item of type **Service**.

For more information, see <A href="ind-set-up-service-codes-for-service-goods.md">(IND) Set up service codes for service goods</A>.</P>



7.  Depending on the version that you are using, do one of the following:
    
      - In AX 2012 R3 and cumulative update 6 or later for AX 2012 R2: In the **Service category** field, select one of the following options to indicate the service category for the journal line:
        
          - **Inward** – Select this option when you purchase goods from a vendor.
        
          - **Inter unit or input** – Select this option either when you transfer goods between two units within your legal entity, or when you transfer goods from the legal entity to a subcontractor for additional processing. For example, you can select this option when the goods are manufactured in one unit and then transferred to the packing unit of your legal entity.
        
          - **Others** – Select this option for other service categories. The input tax amount for this category is posted to the expense account instead of the recoverable account or the interim recoverable account.

          - **Others** – Select this option for all other categories of GTA services.
