# About setting effective dates for names and addresses 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can set effective dates for any addresses that are assigned to a party record.

When a party changes their address, you can update the address record to reflect the date on which the current address will no longer be effective. If you know the new address, you can set effective dates for the new address. You can set or update effective dates for an address in the **Manage addresses** form. (In the party record, click \> **Addresses** FastTab \> **More options** \> **Advanced**.)
