# Maintain timesheet favorites 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use timesheet favorites to save a template of the projects, categories, and activities that you use frequently. Then you can use these entries when you create a new timesheet. You do not have to enter the same information about projects and activities for every new timesheet.

Managers can set up favorites and then assign them to workers or groups of workers. Workers can set up their own timesheet entries as favorites.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>When you create a new timesheet by using favorites, all timesheet favorites are entered in the new timesheet. This is true whether the favorites were created by a manager in the <STRONG>Timesheet favorites</STRONG> form or by a worker in the <STRONG>My favorites</STRONG> form.</P>
