3.  Use the **Foreign currency revaluation** form to process the currency foreign currency revaluation to generate any unrealized gain or loss amounts due to currency fluctuation. For more information, see [Perform a foreign currency revaluation](perform-a-foreign-currency-revaluation.md).

4.  Settle transactions for each ledger account with transactions from the same or other ledger accounts in the **Ledger settlements** form. For more information, see [Settle transactions between ledger accounts](settle-transactions-between-ledger-accounts.md).

5.  Use the **Process allocation request** form to process allocation rules. For more information, see [Process an allocation request](process-an-allocation-request.md).

10. In the **Ledger calendar** form, select the fiscal year and period to modify, and then select **On hold** or **Closed** in the **Period status** field to prevent users from posting transactions in the closed month. You can reopen a period that is on hold, but you cannot reopen a closed period.
