# Create a letter of guarantee request for a new project 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A letter of guarantee can be issued for a new project between a principal and beneficiary. After the project has been created, the principal can create a letter of guarantee request for the vendor and submit it to the bank. When the bank receives and approves the request, the letter of guarantee is issued to the beneficiary.
