# (RUS) About vendor invoices 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can create a new invoice, define the invoice account, and select the open purchase orders and purchase lines to invoice simultaneously. You can group invoices by using a common code. If a payment group is specified for a vendor invoice, the other invoices that use the payment group are included in a single settlement. You can update and post invoices that are grouped together by using references to invoice groups.

## Vendor invoices

You can create invoices by selecting open purchase orders and purchase lines when you post an invoice by using the **Purchase order** form. You can filter purchase lines by the kind of activity and the posting profile. Only purchase lines with the same kind of activity and posting profile can be grouped. You can verify these invoices and then post them together.

## Enter and save vendor invoices for purchase orders

You can save pending invoices in the **Vendor invoice** form. You can also put invoices on hold in the **Vendor invoice** form.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You cannot post invoices that are on hold.</P>



## Add invoice lines that are not associated with a purchase order

You can create vendor invoices that are not associated with any purchase orders. These vendor invoices can contain a mixture of invoice lines that are for purchase order lines and invoice lines that are not for purchase order lines. You can also manually add invoice lines that are not for a purchase order to a vendor invoice that is associated with a purchase order.

## Add invoices to an invoice group

You can add invoices to an invoice group. You can then find and update invoices that are grouped together, without using a query.

## Print vendor invoices in the TORG-12 format

You can post a vendor invoice in the **Vendor invoice** form. Vendor invoices can be posted and printed in the **TORG-12** format. You can use the **TORG-12** format for invoices to confirm the purchase and receipt of items. After posting, you can print the invoices in Microsoft Excel.
