# Define formula ingredients for shelf life inheritance 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can select ingredients that are used to update the shelf life information for finished items. If you select an ingredient that is a shelf life item, the **Inherit shelf life dates to end item** check box is available in the **Formula line** form. If the formula version contains co-products that are configured as shelf life items, the **Inherit shelf life dates to co-product** check box is available in the **Formula line** form.

You can select all the shelf life ingredients based on which the earliest shelf life dates (the best-before date and the expiration date) are calculated and updated for the finished items.

After you define the formula ingredients based on the shelf life ingredients, you can create batch orders and process the finished items and any related co-products. After you run the report as finished process, the calculated earliest shelf life dates (the best-before date and the expiration date) are updated in the inventory batches for the finished item and any related co-products.
