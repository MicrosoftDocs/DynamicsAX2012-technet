# Accounts payable 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_






Use Accounts payable to track vendor invoices and outgoing expenditures. You can enter vendor invoices manually or receive them electronically through a service, or your vendor can enter the invoices by using a vendor portal. After the invoices are entered or received, you can review and approve the invoices by using an invoice approval journal or the **Vendor invoice** form. You can use invoice matching, vendor invoice policies, and workflow to automate the review process so that invoices that meet certain criteria are automatically approved, and the remaining invoices are flagged for review by an authorized user.

After vendor invoices are approved, you can pay vendors. If your organization includes multiple legal entities, you can use centralized payments to pay all invoices from a single legal entity. Multiple payment formats are supported. These include checks, promissory notes, and Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) electronic payments. You can settle invoices with payments or credit notes by using the **Settle open transactions** form. To view vendor information, use the **All vendors** list page and related forms.
