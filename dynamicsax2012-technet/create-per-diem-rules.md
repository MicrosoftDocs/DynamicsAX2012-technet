A per diem is an allowance that the organization provides to a worker who is incurring expenses for business purposes. Per diems are typically used to cover expenses such as meals, lodging, and other incidental expenses. You can create rules for the per diem allowances that your organization offers to workers.

1.  Click **Travel and expense** \> **Setup** \> **Per diems** \> **Per diems**. Click **New**.

2.  In the **Location** and **Currency** fields, select the travel location and the currency that you want to apply.

3.  On the **General** FastTab, enter the start dates and the end dates for this per diem rule.

4.  Enter the per diem rate for hotels, meals, and other expenses that workers may incur when they travel.

5.  If you want to reduce the per diem rate based on factors such as the first day, last day, or hours per day, click **Per diem rate tiers**, and then click **New**.
