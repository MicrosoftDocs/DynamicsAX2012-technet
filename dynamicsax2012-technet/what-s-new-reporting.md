## New features in cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2

The following reporting features have been added in cumulative update 7.

## Windows PowerShell command for integrating multiple Reporting Services instances with Microsoft Dynamics AX

If multiple instances of Reporting Services run on the same computer, and you want to integrate those instances with Microsoft Dynamics AX, a Windows PowerShell command is now available that automates the process.

For example, assume that you have a report server that hosts three Reporting Services instances. To integrate these instances with Microsoft Dynamics AX, you must follow these steps:

1.  Integrate the first Reporting Services instance with Microsoft Dynamics AX. To do this, run the Microsoft Dynamics AX setup wizard to install the reporting extensions, and then deploy the reports that are included with Microsoft Dynamics AX. For more information, see [Checklist: Install the Reporting Services extensions and deploy reports](checklist-install-the-reporting-services-extensions-and-deploy-reports.md).

2.  Integrate the second Reporting Services instance with Microsoft Dynamics AX by running the Install-AXReportInstanceExtensions Windows PowerShell command.

3.  Integrate the third Reporting Services instance with Microsoft Dynamics AX by running the Install-AXReportInstanceExtensions command.

The following diagram summarizes this process.

![Multiple SSRS instances on one server](images/Dn527264.MultiSSRSInstances_CU7(AX.60).gif "Multiple SSRS instances on one server")

For information about how to run the Install-AXReportInstanceExtensions command, see [Install multiple instances of Reporting Services on the same computer (for use with Microsoft Dynamics AX)](install-multiple-instances-of-reporting-services-on-the-same-computer-for-use-with-microsoft-dynamics-ax.md).

## New class that improves the performance of the report server

Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services periodically restarts, and each restart clears the Reporting Services cache. After the cache has been cleared, it may take some time for the next report that is run to display. To minimize the effect of Reporting Services restarts, a new class that is named SRSReportServerWarmup is included with cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2. When the SRSReportServerWarmup class runs, it prepares the report server for use by performing the following tasks:

1.  Loads Microsoft Dynamics AX business logic assemblies

2.  Connects to Reporting Services

3.  Runs a sample report that is named SRSReportServerWarmup

As a best practice, you should schedule the batch job that runs the SRSReportServerWarmup class to run immediately after Reporting Services restarts. For more information about how to configure the batch job, see [Run the SRSReportServerWarmup class](run-the-srsreportserverwarmup-class.md).

## Ability to email reports to specific people by using tokens

In cumulative update 7, you can email reports to specific people by using tokens. When you use this feature, you donâ€™t have to enter the email addresses of all recipients. Instead, you just enter a token. The token instructs Microsoft Dynamics AX to retrieve the appropriate email addresses from worker, customer, or vendor records.

You email reports to the following people:

  - Workers in your organization who have a specific job title
    
    You can use the **@\<Job Title\>@** token to email reports to workers in your organization who have a specific job title. For example, suppose that you want to email the **Recruitment Projects** report to all workers in your organization who have the job title of **Staffing Specialist**. In this scenario, you would enter the **@Staffing Specialist@** token in the **To** field when you email the report.
    
    The **@Staffing Specialist@** token instructs Microsoft Dynamics AX to perform the following tasks:
    
    1.  Retrieve a list of all workers who have the **Staffing Specialist** job title.
    
    2.  Retrieve the primary email address for each worker who is identified in step 1.
    
    3.  Email the **Recruitment Projects** report to each worker who is identified in step 1 by using the email addresses that are retrieved in step 2.

  - Customers and vendors who have a specific purpose
    
    You can email reports to customers and vendors who have a specific purpose by using the **@\<Purpose\>@** token. In Microsoft Dynamics AX, contact information (such as email addresses) for customers and vendors has a purpose associated with it. For example, a customer may have an email address where the purpose is *Billing* and another email address where the purpose is *Delivery*. Now suppose that you want to email a sales order to a customer. In this scenario, you would enter the following token in the **To** field when emailing the sales order: **@Billing@**
    
    The **@Billing@** token instructs Microsoft Dynamics AX to perform the following tasks:
    
    1.  Identify the customer that this sales order must be sent to.
    
    2.  Retrieve a list of email addresses for the customer that have the **Billing** purpose.
    
    3.  Send the sales order to the customer by using the email addresses that are retrieved in step 2.

For more information about how to insert tokens when you send a report as email, see [Print or email a report](print-or-email-a-report.md).

Developers can customize the functionality of the tokens by using the [SysExtension](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg959544\(v=ax.60\)) framework. For example, you can develop an additional customization to retrieve titles from an external address book and send a report to the list of addresses that is retrieved externally.

You can also customize tokens to specify other print destinations by using print management. For example, you can use tokens to specify a printer based on location. In this scenario, a token such as **@wh printer@** can be used to specify a warehouse printer.

For more information about how to extend tokens, see [Customizing tokens for emailing and printing reports](customizing-tokens-for-emailing-and-printing-reports.md).

## New methods for advanced printer properties

The [SRSPrintDestinationSettings](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg938492\(v=ax.60\)) class contains new methods that let you choose the following printer properties:

  - Print orientation (portrait or landscape)

  - Number of copies to print

  - Target printer tray

  - Collation of printed documents

## Updated Compare Tool for Reporting Services reports

The [Compare Tool](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa849010\(v=ax.60\)) has been updated to support comparison of two Reporting Services report designs.

## Management Reporter now installed with Microsoft Dynamics AX

Management Reporter is a tool that you should use to create financial reports. Management Reporter can now be installed when you install Microsoft Dynamics AX. For installation instructions, see [Install Management Reporter server components](install-management-reporter-server-components.md).

For more information about how to configure and use Management Reporter, see the Management Reporter [configuration guide](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5916) and [blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dynamicscpm/).

## New features in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2

The following reporting features have been added in AX 2012 R2.

## Support for data partitions

An installation of AX 2012 R2 can consist of multiple data partitions. One report server can support all the data partitions in an AX 2012 R2 installation. For more information about data partitions, see [Data partitioning architecture](data-partitioning-architecture.md).

## Support for report servers that run in SharePoint integrated mode

Reporting Services can be installed in either native mode or SharePoint integrated mode. Report servers that run in SharePoint integrated mode are supported by AX 2012 R2.

In SharePoint integrated mode, a report server runs in a SharePoint server farm. Reports are managed and viewed from SharePoint document libraries. For more information, see [Overview of Reporting Services](overview-of-reporting-services.md).

## Support for Power View

Power View is a tool that you can use to create highly-interactive, custom reports. For example, suppose that you want to create a report that shows sales amounts for your retail stores. In this scenario, you can open Power View, connect to the Retail cube, select the fields to display on the report, and then display the report on a Role Center page in Microsoft Dynamics AX.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services and Enterprise Portal are installed on different computers, you must use Kerberos security to create Power View reports.</P>



For more information about how to create Power View reports, see [Create a report by using Power View to connect to a cube](create-a-report-by-using-power-view-to-connect-to-a-cube.md).

## New features in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012

The following reporting features have been added in AX 2012.

## Simplified installation

In AX 2012, the Setup wizard has been updated to simplify the process of installing the Reporting Services extensions. When you install the Reporting Services extensions, the Setup wizard will:

1.  Verify that prerequisite software has been installed on the server that runs Reporting Services. For more information about the prerequisite software, see the [system requirements webpage](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=165377).

2.  Prompt you to select an instance of Reporting Services. The extensions that you install will be configured to use this instance. For more information, see [Install Reporting Services extensions for Microsoft Dynamics AX](install-reporting-services-extensions-for-microsoft-dynamics-ax.md).

3.  Enable you to deploy the default reports that are included with Microsoft Dynamics AX.

## Upgrade information

When you upgrade from Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, existing reports are copied to the AX 2012 system, but they are not upgraded. AX 2012 provides hundreds of default, predefined reports that you can deploy and customize. We recommend that you use these reports as templates and customize them to meet your requirements. For more information, see [Upgrading Reports](upgrading-reports.md).

## Improvements to the report deployment process

The process of deploying reports has changed in the following ways.
