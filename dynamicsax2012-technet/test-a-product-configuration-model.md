# Test a product configuration model 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

After you set up a product configuration model, you can test that the model performs as expected by simulating the process that occurs when an order is entered for the product. You can complete the test by clicking one of the following:

  - **OK** – Create the corresponding bill of materials (BOM) and route. If an issue is found, the system displays a message in an Infolog.

  - **Cancel** – Close the configuration without validating it.

<!-- end list -->

1.  Click **Product information management** \> **Common** \> **Product configuration models**.

2.  Select the product model to test, and then, on the **Action Pane**, click **Test**.

3.  To validate the product model, click **OK**. To cancel the validation, click **Cancel**.
