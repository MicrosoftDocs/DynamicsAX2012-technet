# Viewing an expense report from the General ledger 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When you perform a query to view transactions in **General ledger** or **Procurement and sourcing**, the amount of information that is returned by the query may be too much and you might want to narrow your search. To get the information that you need, you can drill down into a transaction to see the expense report that it appeared on.

For expense reports, you can drill down from a transaction to the original report that is stored in Expense management. You can view the total amount of expenses in addition to the itemized transactions, transactions that are eligible for Value Added Tax (VAT) recovery, and the receipts that are attached to the expenses.

To drill down to the original expense report:

  - Select the transaction that you want to investigate and then click the **Original document** button.

When you view the individual transactions, you can also view any additional data that is attached to a transaction. For example, for an itemized hotel expense, you can view a detailed list of expenses such as Internet access, telephone calls, and room service.
