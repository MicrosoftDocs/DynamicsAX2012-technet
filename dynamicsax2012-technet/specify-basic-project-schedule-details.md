# Specify basic project schedule details 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use this procedure to specify the basic parameters of a project schedule.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The procedure for completing this task changed for cumulative update 7 or later for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2. The updated procedure also applies to AX 2012 R3. For more information, see the section later in this topic.</P>



## Specify basic project details

1.  Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Common** \> **Projects** \> **All projects**. Select a project to create a schedule for.

2.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Project** tab, in the **Maintain** group, click **Edit**.

3.  On the **Scheduling and resource assignment** FastTab, do the following:
    
      - In the **Schedule start date** and **End date** fields, specify the date range that you want the project to span.
    
      - In the **Scheduling calendar** field, select the scheduling calendar that you want to use to validate start dates and end dates for a project or activity.
    
      - In the **Duration in days** field, update the number of days that you want the project to last. If you make a change here, the end date that you entered for the project is changed.
    
      - In the **Total effort in hours** field, enter the number of total hours that are required to complete the project.
    
      - If you want to ignore the standard working hours that are specified in workers’ own calendars, select the **Scheduling ignores the calendar of the resource** check box.
        
        When you ignore the standard working hours for a worker, you increase your view of the worker’s capacity to 24 hours per day. This option is useful for planning purposes in special cases, such as for projects that have non-standard hour requirements, or when you know a worker will be visiting or reassigned to a different time zone to work on the project or activity.
