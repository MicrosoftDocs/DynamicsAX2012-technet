<td><p>Mass expiration of benefit enrollments</p></td>
<td><p>You can now change the expiration date of a benefit and the affected worker enrollments in that benefit at the same time. You can also change the expiration date of the benefit enrollment for multiple workers at the same time, without changing the expiration date of the benefit. This functionality resembles the functionality for mass benefit enrollment. The benefit administrator can maintain the expiration date of benefits without having to change the benefit expiration date individually for each worker who is enrolled in the benefit. This feature saves time for the benefit administrator and reduces the risk of errors.</p>
