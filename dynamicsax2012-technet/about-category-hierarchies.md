# About category hierarchies 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This topic explains what category hierarchies are and the advantages of using a category hierarchy for procurement versus using a product. Category hierarchies are used to classify products or transactions for reporting and analysis. An organization can create more than one category hierarchy. For example, your organization might create one category hierarchy for classifying products that it buys, and another hierarchy for products that it sells. The number of category hierarchies that your organization uses, and the structure and number of subcategories in each category hierarchy, depend on the reporting needs of your organization.

There are several industry-standard classification systems and commodity code systems for reporting to government agencies or industry organizations. Some of the more common examples are Intrastat, UNSPSC, NAICS, eCl@ss, eOTD, and NIGP. Your system administrator can import all or part of an external classification system into Microsoft Dynamics AX. You can also manually create the categories and commodity codes. For more information about how to import categories and commodity codes, see [Import categories (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh242810\(v=ax.60\)).

After you create a category hierarchy, assign a type to the category hierarchy. The type determines how the category hierarchy appears in Microsoft Dynamics AX. For example, when you assign the **Procurement category hierarchy** type to a hierarchy, the products from this procurement category hierarchy are displayed in procurement forms such as requests for quotations and purchase requisitions.

The following table lists the available category hierarchy types and the general purpose of each type.

When you create a category hierarchy, you can assign attributes to categories to define characteristics of the category. An example of a category attribute is **Category manager**. When you assign this attribute to a category, you enter the name of the person to contact about products or other items that are assigned to the category.

When you create a procurement category hierarchy, you can assign vendors, products, product attributes, policies, and other parameters to each procurement category. For more information about procurement category hierarchies, see [Procurement categories (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh227365\(v=ax.60\)).

## Advantages of using category hierarchies for procurement versus using products

You can use categories, products, or both for procurement. To decide what to use, consider whether the product is for internal use or for resale; if you need hierarchical reporting for procurement and sales, retail, commodity codes, or derived financial hierarchies; whether the products will be used in manufacturing, and inventory reporting requirements. You should also be aware of differences in how categories and products are processed on purchase order lines and sales order lines, and how they work with two-way and three-way matching policies.

Refer to the following table to help you decide whether to use category hierarchies or products for different situations.
