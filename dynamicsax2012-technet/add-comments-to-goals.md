# Add comments to goals 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

After a goal is started, you should not add or modify information about the goal. This is to make sure that information in the goal remains consistent. Use the **Comments** tab to add information to a goal without modifying the field values for the goal. After you save a comment, you cannot modify it.

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Periodic** \> **Performance** \> **Goal details**.

2.  Select a goal and then expand the **Comments** FastTab.

3.  Click **Add**.

4.  In the **Note** field, enter the comment text.
