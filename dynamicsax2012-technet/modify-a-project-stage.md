# Modify a project stage 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Project stages can serve as a guide to the project life cycle. You can define the project stages that you want to include in your projects in the **Project stage** area in the **Project management and accounting parameters** form. Microsoft Dynamics AX provides five predefined project stages and three user-defined stages.

1.  Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Setup** \> **Project management and accounting parameters**.

2.  In the **Project management and accounting parameters** form, click the **Project stage** link, and then select the predefined or user-defined stage that you want to modify.

3.  If you want to rename the project stage, click **Rename**. In the **Rename project stage** form, select the language that you want to use for the new project stage name, enter the new name in the **Text** field, and then click **OK**.

4.  In the **Project stage** area, select or clear the **Stage** check boxes to make your changes to the project types.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>This will update all projects of the type that you are making the changes to.</P>



5.  If you want to change the rules that are associated with the stage, click **Project stage rules**. In the **Rules** form for stages, select a project type, and then select or clear the check boxes for the project type activities.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can change the stages of a parent project in the <STRONG>Project</STRONG> form. When you make changes, you can indicate whether the changes will affect only the parent project, all subprojects with the same project type as the parent project, or all subprojects of the parent project.</P>
