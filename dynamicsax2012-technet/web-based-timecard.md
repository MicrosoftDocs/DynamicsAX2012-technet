# Web-based timecard 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use the electronic timecard from **Employee services** on the Enterprise Portal. However, you must first acquire the specific Enterprise Portal role for Time and attendance. Also, you must have the profile of a time registration worker in Microsoft Dynamics AX.

The electronic timecard on the Enterprise Portal works in a similar manner as the **Electronic timecard** form on the **Home** area page in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>To open the Electronic timecard form in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client, click <STRONG>Human resources</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Common</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Time and attendance</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Electronic timecard</STRONG>.</P>
