# (IND) Design a screen layout 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use the **Screen layouts** form to set up a layout to include and display the taxes that are calculated on customer order cancellation charges. For more information about how to design a screen layout, see [Screen layouts (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh597310\(v=ax.60\)).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic does not apply to versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 prior to cumulative update 1 for AX 2012 R2.</P>



1.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **POS** \> **Screen layouts**.

2.  Select or create a screen layout. For more information, see [Design a screen layout](design-a-screen-layout.md).

3.  In the **Screen layouts** form, click **Designer** to open the **Screen layout designer** form.

4.  Click **Design mode**, and then click **Main layout**.

5.  In the **Customization** form, click **Tax on cancellation**, and then drag it to the screen layout designer. **Tax on cancellation** no longer appears in the **Customization** form, because each layout can contain only one tax on cancellation charge.
