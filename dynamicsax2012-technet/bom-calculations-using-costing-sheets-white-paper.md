# BOM calculations using costing sheets (White paper) 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


This white paper describes the setup of the costing sheet and the additional elements that are involved in the calculation of manufacturing overhead for a bill of materials (BOM). The processes for including direct and indirect costs in the calculation of manufacturing overhead for a BOM are described for both single-level and multilevel BOM calculations. The paper also provides an overview of how indirect cost calculations can be viewed from a production order and how to analyze production variances.
