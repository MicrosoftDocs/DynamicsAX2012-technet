# BOM calculations using costing sheets (White paper) 


This white paper describes the setup of the costing sheet and the additional elements that are involved in the calculation of manufacturing overhead for a bill of materials (BOM). The processes for including direct and indirect costs in the calculation of manufacturing overhead for a BOM are described for both single-level and multilevel BOM calculations. The paper also provides an overview of how indirect cost calculations can be viewed from a production order and how to analyze production variances.
