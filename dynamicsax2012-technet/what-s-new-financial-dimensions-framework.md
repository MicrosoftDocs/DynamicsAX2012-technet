# What's new: Financial dimensions framework 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Financial dimensions are data classifiers that are used for financial reporting. Financial dimensions identify information such as the purpose, cost center, and department. Financial dimensions have changed considerably since Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009.

## New functionality

Financial dimensions are now more easily adapted to fit your requirements. Many aspects of data entry have been streamlined and simplified, and you can view more detailed financial information and information about transactions.

## Special considerations

You must complete certain steps in the Pre-upgrade checklist before you can upgrade to Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. In AX 2009, you could create ledger account categories and financial dimensions for each company. In AX 2012, the main account categories and financial dimensions that you create are shared and can be used by any of the legal entities that are set up in Microsoft Dynamics AX. Therefore, you must select the main account categories and financial dimension sets that can be shared between the legal entities.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Financial dimension sets were known as dimension focuses in earlier releases. Financial dimension sets are shared by all the legal entities that are set up in the <STRONG>Legal entities</STRONG> form. Financial dimension sets in AX 2012 are not the same as the dimension sets in earlier versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX.</P>



## Comparison with AX 2009

Financial dimensions have changed considerably since AX 2009. The dimensions framework from earlier versions has been removed, and the financial dimensions framework in AX 2012 is new. AX 2012 also includes changes to the following areas:

  - Financial dimensions

  - Charts of accounts

  - Account structures

  - Account dimension values on transactions

  - Financial statements and reporting

  - Analyzing ledger cubes
