# Specify inclusive or exclusive tax [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

Inclusive taxes are included in product prices. Value-added tax (VAT) is one example of inclusive tax. Exclusive taxes are not included in product prices. In Retail, you can specify settings for inclusive tax and exclusive tax for each customer. You can also specify settings for each store.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>When tax is calculated, the settings for inclusive and exclusive tax that are specified for a customer override the settings that are specified for a store.</P>



1.  Click **Retail** \> **Common** \> **Retail channels** \> **Retail stores**.

2.  On the **Retail stores** list page, open the store to modify.

3.  In the **Stores** form, on the **General** FastTab, under **Sales tax**, select the **Prices include sales tax** check box if product prices in the store include taxes. Clear the check box if product prices in the store do not include taxes.
