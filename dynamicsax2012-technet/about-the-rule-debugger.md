# About the rule debugger 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The **Rule debugger** is a tool for testing product models in the **Product Builder**. Use it to validate the rules of the product model you are building.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This information applies only to Product builder.</P>



For information about how to enable **Rule debugger**, see [Enable/disable the rule debugger](enable-disable-the-rule-debugger.md).

Errors in rules and constraints are flagged. This includes their location, so that you can correct flaws and learn what to avoid when you update old models or build new models.

If you enable the **Rule debugger**, it automatically starts when you test your model. It continually tracks your selections and provides feedback on the behavior of the individual rule or constraint. You can see whether the results are what you want.

Helpful tips for using the Rule debugger:

  - The **Rule debugger** is enabled per user. This means that when the **Rule debugger** is enabled by a user, it tracks all product models being configured by that user.

  - You can clear the **Rule debugger** to start again if you want to test a different configuration.

  - The **Rule debugger** form acts as a rule tracer and, therefore, does not accept direct input from the user.
