# Activate your Partner Portal account for Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Beginning October 1, 2015, RapidStart services will no longer be supported. For more information, see the announcement on CustomerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/northamerica/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued or PartnerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/news-events/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued.

As the Partner implementation expert for Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services, you can use your existing account to access Partner Portal if someone in your partner organization has previously signed up for any online service that can be combined with Microsoft Dynamics ERP. If your organization’s account is not active, you must activate the account in Partner Portal. After the account is active, you can add your customers and prospects, and make Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services and other online services available to those customers and prospects.

## Activate your Partner Portal account

1.  In your browser, open online services for Microsoft Dynamics ERP at [http://www.dynamicsonline.com](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=141031).

2.  On the online services home page, click **For Partners**.

3.  On the **Tools for Partners** page, click **Register now**.

4.  Complete the information for your organization by entering the Microsoft account (formerly Windows Live ID) that you use to sign in to PartnerSource. The registration process validates that the Microsoft account is associated with the partner organization’s account in the VOICE system.

The person who activates the organization’s account on online services becomes the administrator for the organization’s account in Partner Portal. You can add other users who have administrative privileges later.

If you see a logon page instead of the registration page, someone from your organization has already activated your organization’s account in Partner Portal. That person can add you as an additional administrator.

After you activate your organization’s account in Partner Portal, the **Getting Started – Partner Portal for Microsoft Dynamics® ERP** page is displayed. This page contains a brief description of the process for adding customers.

## Troubleshooting

Use the following information to troubleshoot some common issues.

**Q:** The account administrator who activated our account in Partner Portal left our organization. How do we change the account administrator?

**A:** Contact Support. A support engineer can change the account administrator for you.

**Q:** I receive a message that states, “Service is unavailable.” What do I do?

**A:** There are two possible causes for this error:

  - You have just activated your subscription for RapidStart Services. Wait several minutes, and then try again.
    
    Up to 72 hours may be required before you can access RapidStart Services. If you still receive the message 72 hours after you activated your subscription, contact Support.

  - You signed in by using a different Microsoft account than the Microsoft account that was used to activate your Partner Portal account. Click **Sign out**, and then sign in by using the Microsoft account that was used to activate your Partner Portal account.
