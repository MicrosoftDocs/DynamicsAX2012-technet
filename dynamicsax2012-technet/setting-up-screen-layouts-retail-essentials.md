# Setting up screen layouts (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

The graphical design of the interface of is controlled by a screen layout. A layout controls the position of various elements on the screen, such as total amounts, product information, customer information, payment information, and the location of various buttons. A screen layout can also contain pictures and custom button grids.

You can design several screen layouts for a business, and then select the screen layouts to use for specific registers. You can also assign a specific screen layout to a worker or a store. When Retail essentials starts, the layout that is displayed is based on whether a specific layout is assigned to the worker who logged on, the register, or the store, in that order.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Often, the Retail essentials screen layout is specified at the head office and then sent to the stores. In this case, any customizations that are done at the stores are lost.</P>
