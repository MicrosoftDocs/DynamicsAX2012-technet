# Set up replenishment hierarchies 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

You can set up replenishment hierarchies to group the stores that are replenished. The groupings can be based on the organization, size, turnover, or type of the stores.

## Set up a replenishment hierarchy

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Organization** \> **Organization hierarchies**.

2.  Select a hierarchy.

4.  On the **Purposes** FastTab, click **Assign purpose**.

5.  In the **Purposes** field, select **Retail replenishment**, and then click **Add**. Then select the organization hierarchy that you created in step 3.

6.  Close the **Organization hierarchy purposes** form, and then, in the **Organization hierarchies** form, click **View**.
    
    Microsoft Dynamics AX displays the **Hierarchy designer -** form, where you can create a visual representation of the retail hierarchy.

7.  In the **Save as draft** group, click **Edit**.

8.  In the **Modify** group, click **Insert**, click the type of organization to which the retail hierarchy belongs, and then click the organization to insert.

9.  In the **Modify** group, click **Insert**, click **Retail channel**, and then click the channel to insert.

10. If you want to save the hierarchy so that you can complete it later, click **Save as draft**.
