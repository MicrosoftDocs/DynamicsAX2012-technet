# Set up a transportation template

You can use transportation templates to override the general rating setup that is returned when you rate a shipping carrier. Templates enable you to identify specific charges that apply to the shipping carrier. If a transportation template is selected for a shipping carrier, the template charges will override the charges from the general rating setup that applies to the shipping carrier. For more information about the general rating setup, see [Set up rate masters](set-up-rate-masters.md). The template also overrides any charges that are set up for the shipping carrier in the **Override charges** form.

When you use a transportation template, you can specify that charges from a shipping carrier should correspond to charges for a customer or to a specific charge that will be applied in the rating of the shipment carrier.

## Set up a transportation template

To set up a transportation template, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Transportation management** \> **Setup** \> **General** \> **Transportation template**.

2.  Click **New** to create a new transportation template.

3.  Enter an identification and a name for the transportation template.

4.  On the **Shipper** FastTab, specify the shipping carrier that should be associated with a specific charge. You can also specify if a carrier group, carrier service, or route plan should be associated with specific charges.

5.  On the **Customer** FastTab, specify the customer or customer details that will indicate if the rating setup that is returned for the shipping carrier should be ignored.

6.  Select the **Manual** check box to specify a specific charge for the shipment carrier.

7.  On the **Charges** FastTab, click **New** to create a charge for the shipment carrier. This charge is only available if, on the **Customer** FastTab, you have selected the **Manual** check box.

8.  Optional: On the **Additional information** FastTab, in the **Load template ID** field, select a load template to be associated with the charge. If any equipment is registered for the load template, it is displayed in the **Equipment** field.

## Select a transportation template

To make sure that a transportation template is considered when you rate a load in the **Rate route workbench** form, the transportation template must be selected.

To select a transportation template, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Transportation management** \> **Inquiries** \> **Rate route workbench**.

2.  On the **Rate criteria** tab, in the **Data** group, select the **Transportation template ID**.
