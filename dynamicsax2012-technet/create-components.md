# Create components 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A component is a generic element that can be assigned to a product configuration model. After you assign a component to a product configuration model, you can add information to the component so that it suits that particular model. This can include information about user requirements, attributes, and constraints. A component can also include other components as subcomponents. For more information, see [Create a subcomponent for a component](create-a-subcomponent-for-a-component.md). A component can be used more than one time in a product configuration model, and it can be used by more than one product configuration model.

## Create a component for product configuration models

1.  Click **Product information management** \> **Common** \> **Product configuration models**.

2.  On the **Action Pane**, click **Components**.

3.  In the **Components** form, click **New** on the toolbar.

4.  In the **Name** field, enter the name of the component.
    

    > [!TIP]
    > <P>The name of the component is displayed in the product model tree when you view a constraint-based product configuration model.</P>



5.  In the **Description** field, enter a description of the component.
