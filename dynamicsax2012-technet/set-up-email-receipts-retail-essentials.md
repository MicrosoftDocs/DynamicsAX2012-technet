# Set up email receipts (Retail essentials) 


Email receipts are an environmentally friendly option for processing retail sales. The customer can decide whether to receive a printed receipt, an email receipt, or both. This topic explains how to set up email receipts.

For customers who are set up in Retail essentials, you can set the customer receipt option in the **Customers** form. For customers who are not set up in Retail essentials, set the default receipt option in the **Retail parameters** form.

You can set up the message body of the email receipt as form notes. You can then send email messages in different languages, depending on the language of each customer. If no customer is selected, the email message uses the language settings for your company. The form note must be set up as a **Retail Headquarters Receipt** form type.

**Prerequisites**

Before you can generate email receipts for your customers, you must configure email functionality in Retail essentials. This step includes the following tasks:

  - Set up and configure the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server, and then connect Retail essentials to the SMTP server. For more information, see [Configure email functionality in Microsoft Dynamics AX](configure-email-functionality-in-microsoft-dynamics-ax.md).

  - Set up an email notification profile, and assign it to your company and stores. Email notification profiles enable email messages to be sent to an individual or a group of recipients, based on user-configured parameters.

After you complete these steps, use the procedures in this topic to set up email receipt options for your company and customers.
