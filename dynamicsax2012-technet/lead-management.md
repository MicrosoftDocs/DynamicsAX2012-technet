# Lead management [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use lead records to help your sales team gather and store information about a lead. By using this information, you can implement the sales activities and tasks that qualify a lead to move to the next level and become an opportunity.

Lead records contain various types of information. You can store and attach information for multiple contacts and addresses, source types and references, and documents. You can also associate multiple responsibilities, activities, campaigns, projects, and other leads to a lead record.

As you manage a lead record, you can update the status to indicate where it is in the sales process. You can qualify a lead record and then create a new opportunity or a customer record for the lead.

You can disqualify, delete, or postpone a record if it seems that the lead will not become an opportunity or customer for your organization. When you delete a lead record, you can also delete any associated activities, responsibilities, campaigns, and contacts. If you postpone a lead record, you can reactivate or disqualify the lead later.
