# Create partitions 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Data partitions enable isolation of data. By default, an installation of Microsoft Dynamics AX contains a single partition that is named "Initial". You can create additional partitions.


> [!WARNING]
> <P>A partition cannot be deleted after it has been created.</P>



1.  In the **Partition initialization checklist**, click **Create partitions**.

2.  Click **Add**.

3.  Enter a unique string for the partition key that identifies the partition. The string cannot contain more than eight characters.

4.  In the **Name** field, enter an optional description of the partition.

5.  If you decide that you do not want to create the partition, click **Delete** before you exit the row or close the form.

6.  Close the form.
