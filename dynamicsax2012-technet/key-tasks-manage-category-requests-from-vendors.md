# Key tasks: Manage category requests from vendors 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Vendors who are approved to do business in a procurement category in your organization might want to extend their business to supply products in additional procurement categories. The vendor submits the category application request in the Vendor portal in Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX.

When a vendor submits a new category request, the vendor specifies the procurement categories that they want to do business in and submits the request to workflow. A category request is routed via workflow to an approver. Category requests are displayed on the **Vendor requests** list page in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client.

The status of the vendor category request changes as you process the request in workflow. For more information, see [About workflow statuses for category extension requests](about-workflow-statuses-for-category-extension-requests.md).

## Approve a vendor request

Use this procedure to approve a new category request from a vendor.

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Common** \> **Vendor requests** \> **Vendor requests**. On the **Vendor requests** list page, open a request that has a request type of **Category**.

2.  In the **Vendor category approval** form, on the **Categories** FastTab, view the requested procurement category.

3.  Optionally, you can add or remove procurement categories before you approve the request. On the **Action Pane**, click **Edit**. Use the following procedures to modify the request:
    
      - To add a procurement category to the request, on the **Categories** FastTab, click **New**, and then select a category.
    
      - To remove a procurement category, on the **Categories** FastTab, select the check box for the category that you want to remove, and then click **Delete**.

4.  On the **Business justification** FastTab, view the justification for the request.

5.  If the vendor has attached a document to the request, on the **Action Pane**, click **Attachments**.

6.  If your organization requires a vendor to complete a questionnaire to do business in a procurement category, on the **Questionnaire information** FastTab, open the questionnaire to view the responses.

7.  To approve the category request, in the workflow message bar, click **Actions** \> **Approve**.

If workflow is configured to notify the vendor, the vendor is sent an e-mail message that the category request is approved. The vendor can also see the status of the category request in the Vendor portal in Enterprise Portal.
