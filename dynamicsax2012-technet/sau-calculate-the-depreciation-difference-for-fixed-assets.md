_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Before you calculate depreciation for a fixed asset, you must enter the asset group and the group type in the **Zakat assets group** form. For more information, see [(SAU) Set up a report name, item code, and asset group for Zakat reporting](sau-set-up-a-report-name-item-code-and-asset-group-for-zakat-reporting.md).

To generate Zakat reports you must calculate the depreciation according to the books value and the depreciation difference value. Use the **Zakat assets and depreciation** form to calculate the depreciation difference and record extra maintenance expenses, which are required to generate Zakat reports.

Use this procedure to calculate the depreciation according to the books value and the depreciation difference value.

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Periodic** \> **Zakat** \> **Zakat assets and depreciation**.

2.  In the **Fiscal year** field, select a fiscal year.

3.  Press CTRL+N to create a new line.

4.  Enter the appropriate information in the required fields.

5.  Click **Calculate depreciation difference** to calculate and display depreciation according to the financial books and depreciation difference in the **Depreciation as per books** and **Depreciation difference** fields.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The <STRONG>Calculate depreciation difference</STRONG> button is available only when the status of the fiscal year is <STRONG>Open</STRONG>.</P>



6.  Close the form to save your changes.
