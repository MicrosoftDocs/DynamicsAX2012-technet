# (JPN) Identify impaired assets and post journals for impairment 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Follow the steps in this topic to generate a list of fixed assets that are possibly impaired, run the impairment recognition test to generate a list of impaired fixed assets, and then create and post journals for fixed asset impairments.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic does not apply to versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 prior to cumulative update 7 for AX 2012 R2.</P>

## 1\. Generate a list of fixed assets that are possibly impaired

Use the **Impairment review** form to generate a list of fixed assets that are possibly impaired and a list of transactions for review purposes. You can review the fixed assets and transactions, and then generate a report for distribution, receiving, or other purposes, if required.

To perform this task, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Periodic** \> **Impairment** \> **Impairment management**.

2.  In the **Book type** field, select **Value model** or **Depreciation book** as the book type to review impairments for.

3.  On the **Carrying amount overview** FastTab, click **Query**, and then specify the criteria, such as fixed asset numbers, fixed asset groups, or value models to generate the list of fixed assets. Click **OK**. The list of fixed assets that are to be reviewed is updated on the **Carrying amount overview** FastTab in the **Impairment review** form.

4.  Click **Specify percentage**, and then in the **Percentage** field, enter the percentage of fixed assets from the list of fixed assets to review impairments for.

5.  On the **Transaction analysis overview** FastTab, click **Query**, and then specify the criteria, such as fixed asset numbers, fixed asset groups, or value models to generate the list of fixed asset transactions. Click **OK**. The list of fixed asset transactions that are to be reviewed is updated on the **Transaction analysis overview** FastTab in the **Impairment review** form. It is not mandatory to generate a list of transactions. However, you can use the transactions to review the fixed assets.

6.  Select a fixed asset on the **Carrying amount overview** FastTab or select a transaction on the **Transaction analysis overview** FastTab, and then click **Generate report** to generate a report, if required.

You can select fixed assets in the **Impairment review** form, and then click **Update impairment indicators** to open the **Update impairment indicators** form, where you can update the impairment indicators for the fixed assets.

## 2\. Run a recognition test to identify assets for impairment accounting

Use the **Impairment recognition test** form to run the impairment recognition test using the impairment indicators to generate a list of impaired fixed assets.

To perform this task, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Periodic** \> **Impairment** \> **Run recognition test**.

2.  In the **Book type** field, select **Value model** or **Depreciation book** as the book type to run the impairment recognition test for.

3.  In the **From date** and **To date** fields, specify the starting date and ending date of the period for the impairment recognition test.

4.  Click **Query** to open the **Inquiry** form, where you can specify the criteria, such as fixed asset numbers, fixed asset groups, and posting layers to run the recognition test for.

5.  Click **OK**.

6.  In the **Impairment recognition test** form, you can verify the list of impaired fixed assets that is updated.

7.  To save the test results for later use, perform these steps:
    
    1.  Click **Save impairment**, and then in the **Impairment test ID** field, enter an identification code for the test result record.
    
    2.  In the **Description** field, enter a description of the test result record.
    
    3.  In the **Date** field, enter the date to save the test result record.

## 3\. Create and post a journal for fixed asset impairments

Use the **Depreciation book journal** or **Fixed assets** form to create and post journal transactions for impaired fixed assets. You can specify details about the impairment before you post the journal.

To perform this task, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Journals** \> **Depreciation book journal**.
    
    –or–
    
    Click **Fixed assets** \> **Journals** \> **Fixed assets**.

3.  Click **Lines** to open the **Journal line** form or the **Journal voucher** form, and then click **Proposals** \> **Impairment proposal**.

4.  In the **Select from the saved impairment test results** dialog box, in the **Impairment test ID** field, select the identification code of the impairment test to create the journal for.

5.  Click **OK** to create journal lines in the **Journal line** form, depending on the information that is available in the impairment test record that you select. You can modify the details about the impairment before you post the journal, if required.

6.  Click **Validate** to validate the depreciation book journal lines or fixed asset journal lines.

7.  Click **Post** \> **Post** to post the journal.

You can view the amount for the impairment transactions for a fixed asset in the **Write down adjustment** field in the **Fixed asset balances** form.
