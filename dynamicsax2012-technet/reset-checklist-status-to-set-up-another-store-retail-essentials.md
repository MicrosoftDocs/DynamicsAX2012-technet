# Reset checklist status to set up another store (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to reset the **Retail store setup checklist** when you want to set up another store. After you use the checklist to set up a store, you must reset the checklist before you can deploy additional stores. Different stores often require different setup values.

For example, you schedule and run batch jobs to deploy stores A and B. You then have to reset the checklist before you can deploy store C.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Even though this task is labeled “Required,” you can postpone it until all the batch jobs for the current store deployment are completed successfully.</P>



1.  Click **Retail essentials** \> **Channels** \> **Setup** \> **Retail store setup checklist**.

2.  In the **Retail store setup checklist**, click **Reset checklist status to set up another store**.
    
    Setup data that was created by the previous checklist tasks is deleted.
