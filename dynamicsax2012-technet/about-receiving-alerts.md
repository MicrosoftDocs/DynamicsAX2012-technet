# About receiving alerts 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use the **Notification list** form to view the alerts that you receive. If you have unread alerts, an icon is displayed in the status bar. Click the icon to open the **Notification list** form.

To make sure that you do not overlook any alerts, you can also have them delivered as pop-up messages or email alerts.

## Pop-up messages

Pop-up messages appear at the bottom of your desktop. In the **Options** form, you can select to receive alerts as pop-up messages.

From the pop-up message, you can view the alert in the **Notification list** form. Alternatively, you can drill down to the origin of the alert to view the context in which the alert was triggered.


> [!TIP]
> <P>Pop-up messages are displayed for a short time and then disappear. To keep the message visible, place the pointer over the pop-up message.</P>



## Email alerts

An email alert is triggered in Microsoft Dynamics AX and sent out as an email message.

If alerts are delivered by email, you can be alerted about events even when you are not working in Microsoft Dynamics AX.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Email alerts cannot be created or sent manually, but must be processed through the email system in Microsoft Dynamics AX.</P>



## Troubleshooting email alerts

If you have set up email alerts but do not receive them, verify the following settings, or check with your administrator:

  - A language must be selected in the **Options** form.

  - The email template must contain the email address of the sender. The sender address is defined in the **Sender e-mail** field in the **E-mail templates** form.

  - The **E-mail** field in the **Options** form must contain the email address of the recipient.
