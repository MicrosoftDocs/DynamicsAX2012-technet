# About Customer Self-Service 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The web interface for **Product Builder** is fully integrated with the **Customer self-service** module.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This information applies only to Product builder.</P>



To make a product model available on the Internet through Customer Self-Service, you must generate web forms for it. For more information, see [Generate web forms for customer self-service](generate-web-forms-for-customer-self-service.md).

If you change the modeling variables setup for a product model after web forms are generated for it, you must generate new web forms and refresh the Application Object Dictionary to make your changes active in Customer Self-Service.

When a web customer selects a configurable item for the shopping basket, the **Product Builder configuration** web form opens. The layout of the form resembles that of other modules, but there is an additional **Validation** button that is used to manually activate validation rules for the product model. (In other modules, data input is validated automatically.)

Configurations initiated through the web interface must be approved, just as configurations initiated from sales orders, purchase orders, production orders, sales quotations, project quotations, or item requirements.
