# Set up transportation management engines 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

To calculate rates, you must manually create one or more transportation management engines, or automatically initialize the base engine data. In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, you can search for available shipment rates based on information such as travel distance or zones in a region. The search criteria are interpreted by transportation management engines that calculate the available rates.

This topic shows how to set up transportation management engines that you can use to calculate shipping carrier rates.

## Setting up transportation management engines

For the engines that are delivered with Microsoft Dynamics AX, the rate calculation is based on data that is controlled by metadata. Engines that are not delivered with Microsoft Dynamics AX can be applied without a metadata configuration. Some of the guidelines in the following sections include descriptions about how to configure metadata and define data. These descriptions do not apply to engines that retrieve data from sources outside Microsoft Dynamics AX. For more information, see “Do all engine configurations require metadata?” in [Transportation management engines](transportation-management-engines.md).

**File name extensions in assembly names**

The file name extension should always be included in the assembly name of an engine. For all of the transportation management engines listed in this topic, you must always include the file name extension, such as in Microsoft.Dynamics.Ax.Tms.dll.

## Set up a rate engine

Before you set up a rate engine to calculate rates, you must complete the following tasks:

  - Set up a rate base type to control the metadata that you use to search for rates. The structure of the rate base type is defined by the type of rate engine and by the type of rate base assigner that is associated with the engine. The rate base type of a rate engine must correspond to the rate base type of the shipping carrier’s rate master. For more information about how to set up a rate base type and how to associate it with a rate master, see [Set up rate masters](set-up-rate-masters.md).

  - Configure metadata for the engine. For more information about metadata and an example that shows how to configure metadata for an engine, see “How do I configure metadata for a transportation management engine?” in [Transportation management engines](transportation-management-engines.md).

To set up a rate engine, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Transportation management** \> **Setup** \> **Engines** \> **Rate engine**.

2.  Create a new rate engine.

3.  Enter an identifier (ID) and name for the rate engine.

4.  In the **Rate base type** field, select a rate base type.

5.  In the **Engine assembly** field, enter the assembly that defines the engine type, such as Microsoft.Dynamics.Ax.Tms.dll.

6.  In the **Engine type** field, enter the fully-qualified name of the .NET type that defines the engine. The name should contain a namespace without an assembly name, such as Microsoft.Dynamics.Ax.Tms.Bll.LtlRateEngine.

7.  Click **Parameters**, and create a new parameter. Enter a name and a parameter value. For example, enter Microsoft.Dynamics.Ax.Tms.dll|Microsoft.Dynamics.Ax.Tms.Bll.LtlRateBaseAssigner as the value for the engine parameter RateBaseAssigner.

## Set up a transit time engine

Set up a transit time engine to calculate the time that it takes to transport goods from point A to point B. The setup includes the following tasks:

  - Create a transit time engine.

  - Configure metadata. For more information about metadata, see “How is metadata used in transportation management engines?” in [Transportation management engines](transportation-management-engines.md).

  - Define data.

To create a transit time engine, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Transportation management** \> **Setup** \> **Engines** \> **Transit time engine**.

2.  Create a new transit time engine.

3.  Enter an ID and name for the transit time engine.

4.  In the **Engine assembly** field, enter the assembly that defines the engine type, such as Microsoft.Dynamics.Ax.Tms.dll.

5.  In the **Engine type** field, enter the fully-qualified name of the .NET type that defines the transportation management engine. The name should contain a namespace without an assembly name. For example, a code for the transportation management engine that corresponds to the type of calculation, such as Microsoft.Dynamics.Ax.Tms.P2PTransitTimeEngine.

6.  In the **Transit time engine** form, click **Parameters** to enter additional engine parameters

To configure metadata, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Transportation management** \> **Setup** \> **Engines** \> **Transit time engine**.

2.  Click **Transit time field**, and then click **New** to create the metadata that you will use to search for rates.

6.  Click the **Details** FastTab, and then click **New** to create lines for the freight bill type.

7.  In the **Sequence** field, enter the sequence that determines the order in which the fields for matching are normalized for freight bill matching.

8.  Enter a description and name for the engine type. The name is the field’s caption in the user interface.

9.  In the **Match required** field, select **Yes** or **No**. This determines whether the dimension value fields of the freight bill and the freight invoice should affect reconciliation of these two documents.
    
    Matching the freight invoice and the freight bill can be completed if the values of the fields are the same on the freight invoice and the freight bill. The **Match required** check box can also be used to determine what happens if the field values are not specified.
    
      - **Yes** – If the matched fields have no values specified, then matching cannot be completed.
    
      - **No** – If the matched fields have no values specified, then matching can be completed.

## Initialize base engine data automatically

You can automatically initialize base engine data to create engine setup data for all the engines that were included with Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3.

If you initialize the base engine data in this manner, data is initialized per company and existing engine data that is set up in individual companies may be disregarded.
