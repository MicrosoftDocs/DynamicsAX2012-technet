# Setting up Retail POS (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

Retail POS is a component of Retail essentials that is used for the day-to-day operations at a store. You use Retail essentials to perform tasks at store headquarters, and Retail POS to perform point-of-sale (POS) tasks at retail stores. POS tasks are performed by using a POS register. Each POS register is uniquely identified by a register number.

The following table shows the operations that are performed in Retail essentials at store headquarters, and in Retail POS at POS registers.
