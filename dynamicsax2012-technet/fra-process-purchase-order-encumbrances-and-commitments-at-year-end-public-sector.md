## Prerequisites

Before you start the year-end process, make sure that the following prerequisites have been set up:

  - Enable budget control.

  - Enable both the encumbrance and pre-encumbrance processes.

  - Set up posting definitions.

  - Assign posting definitions to transaction posting types.

For more information, see [Process purchase orders at year end](process-purchase-orders-at-year-end.md).

## Closing and opening steps

The closing steps when you process purchase orders at the end of a fiscal year are exactly as described in [Process purchase orders at year end](process-purchase-orders-at-year-end.md). There is one addition to the opening steps from what is described in that topic. After the closing entries are reversed, budget reservations are created or updated in commitment documents in the new fiscal year. This is handled by the process. No manual intervention is required.

## Closing commitments

After you have processed purchase orders and commitments, the commitments in the closing fiscal year must be closed.

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Periodic** \> **Fiscal year close** \> **Commitment close**.

2.  Click **Retrieve** to retrieve all open commitments that have a balance larger than zero.

3.  Review all the commitments in the grid. Select all commitments that you want to close as part of your year-end process.
    
    If you have already created commitments for the new fiscal year, they will be included in the grid. Be sure they are not selected for closing.

4.  Click **Process** to close all selected commitments.
    

    > [!WARNING]
    > <P>Closing a commitment line cannot be reversed. If you close a commitment line by mistake, you must create a new commitment to restore the budget reservation.</P>
