You can create many assortments, and then assign one or more assortments to multiple retail channels. Retail channels include brick and mortar stores, online stores, and online marketplaces. You must then have an easy way to view the assortments and products that you have assigned to each retail channel.

You can use the **View assortments** form to view a list of all the assortments that you have assigned to a specific retail channel. Additionally, you can use the **View assortment products** form to view a detailed list of the products that are included in a selected assortment.

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Common** \> **Retail channels** \> **Retail stores**. On the **Retail stores** list page, select a retail store in the list. Then, on the **Store** tab, in the **Inventory** group, on the **Action Pane**, click **View assortments**.

2.  In the **View assortments** form, view the list of assortments that are assigned to the retail channel.
