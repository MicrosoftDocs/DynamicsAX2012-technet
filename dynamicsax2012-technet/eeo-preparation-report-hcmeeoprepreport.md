# EEO preparation report (HcmEEOPrepReport) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

There are several versions of the EEO preparation report that you can use when you prepare the reports required by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The EEOC enforces the federal laws that prohibit discrimination against a job applicant or an employee because of the person's race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic does not apply to versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 prior to cumulative update 6 for AX 2012.</P>



The following list includes all of the available versions of the EEO preparation report:

  - **Incomplete EEO-related values**: Used to identify any missing information that would prevent you from completing an EEO report accurately.

  - **EEO-1**: Used by private-sector entities.

  - **EEO-4**: Used by state and local governments.

  - **EEO-5**: Used by public elementary or secondary schools and school districts.

You should always run the **Incomplete EEO-related values** report and enter missing information before you run any of the other EEO preparation reports. The first time that you run this report, it is possible that every worker will be missing the **Classification of the position type**. This field, which is set up in the **Position types** form, indicates whether the position is full-time or part-time.
