# Organization hierarchies 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

When you create an organization hierarchy in Microsoft Dynamics AX, you must assign a purpose to the hierarchy. The purpose that you assign to a hierarchy determines the types of organizations that can be included in the hierarchy. The purpose also defines the application scenarios that the hierarchy can be used in.

A hierarchy that is created for a purpose may not reflect the actual legal structure of the business. For example, the approval process for requisitions may involve multiple legal entities and positions that don’t report to each other. For instance, the CFO might be required to approve a requisition of a certain amount, even though the organization that submits the requisition does not report to the CFO.

Hierarchies can be used for the following purposes:

  - Centralized customer and vendor payments

  - Policies

  - Organization charts

  - Data access

  - Retail channel management

  - Budget planning

  - Project management

## Centralized customer and vendor payments

Organizations that include multiple legal entities can create and manage payments by using a single legal entity that handles all payments (known as centralized payments). When you centralize payments, the same transaction does not have to be entered in multiple legal entities, and the processes for cross-company payments are simpler. For example, it’s easier to make payment proposals and settlements, and modify open and closed transactions.

To use a hierarchy in this scenario, you must assign the **Centralized payments** purpose to the hierarchy. For more information, see:

  - [About centralized vendor payments](about-centralized-vendor-payments.md)

  - [Set up centralized vendor payments](set-up-centralized-vendor-payments.md)

  - [About centralized customer payments](about-centralized-customer-payments.md)

  - [Set up centralized customer payments](set-up-centralized-customer-payments.md)

## Policies

A policy is a collection of rules that controls a process for an organization. Policies help organizations manage internal processes and help improve cost control, fraud detection, operating efficiency, and performance. To use a hierarchy to set up policies, you must assign an appropriate purpose to the hierarchy. For more information about how to set up policies, see [Set up policy parameters](set-up-policy-parameters.md).

The following table lists the processes that you can control by using policies. It also includes the hierarchy purpose that corresponds to each process.

## Organization chart

An organization chart defines the relationships between departments, jobs, and positions. To use a hierarchy in this scenario, you must assign the **Organization chart** purpose to it. For more information, see [Key tasks: New worker positions](key-tasks-new-worker-positions.md).

## Data access

A user's access to data in Microsoft Dynamics AX can be granted based on the user's relationship to an organization. To use a hierarchy in this scenario, you must assign the **Security** purpose to it. You must also create data security policies to help secure the organizations in the hierarchy. Then, when you associate a user who is in a particular role with a hierarchy, the user's access to data changes automatically when the hierarchy changes. For more information, see [Overview of Security Policies for Table Records](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh272123\(v=ax.60\)) and [Organizations for the automatic role assignment rule (form) or Organizations for the user (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh242784\(v=ax.60\)).

If **Based on security organizations** is the security model selected for budget planning, for example, you must assign the **Security** purpose to the budget planning organization hierarchy so budget plan preparers have access to the budget plans. For more information, see Budget planning in this topic, [Configure budget planning security](configure-budget-planning-security.md), [Configuring Budget Planning for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2](configuring-budget-planning-for-microsoft-dynamics-ax-2012-r2.md), and [Key tasks: Configure budget planning and set up budget planning processes](key-tasks-configure-budget-planning-and-set-up-budget-planning-processes.md).

## Budget planning

Budget planning is the process of preparing the budgets that are implemented by an organization. You can use budget planning to perform the following tasks:

  - Associate budget planning processes with budget cycles, ledgers, and organization hierarchies.

  - Analyze and update budget plans by using multiple scenarios. You can automatically route the budget plans, together with worksheets, justifications, and attachments, for review and approval.

  - Consolidate multiple budget plans from a lower level in the organization into a single parent budget plan at a higher level in the organization. You can also develop a single budget plan at a higher level in the organization and allocate the budget to lower levels in the organization.

The following table describes how organization hierarchies are used for budget planning.

## Project management

The **All projects** list page displays a list of pending project transactions and posted project transactions. You can view these transactions by organization, if you have set up a hierarchy for project management.

To use a hierarchy in this scenario, you must assign the **Project management** purpose to the hierarchy.
