# (BRA) Specify fiscal information for a purchase requisition 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can specify the fiscal information for a purchase requisition by using the **Purchase requisitions** form. Taxes are based on the vendor, item, and fiscal information that is available on a purchase requisition line, such as the Código Fiscal de Operações e Prestações (CFOP) and service code.

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Common** \> **Purchase requisitions** \> **All purchase requisitions**.

2.  Double-click a purchase requisition.

3.  In the **Purchase requisitions** form, on the **Purchase requisition lines** FastTab, click **Details**.

4.  On the **Fiscal information** FastTab, in the **CFOP** field, select the CFOP code for the transaction. The CFOP code or list of CFOP codes that is available depends on the order type, operation type, delivery location of the fiscal establishment, and location of the vendor.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>This field is available only when the vendor is specified on the purchase requisition line.</P>



5.  In the **CFPS code** field, enter the fiscal operation for services (CFPS) code for the purchase requisition line.

6.  In the **Service code** field, enter the fiscal classification code for services.
    

    > [!NOTE]
