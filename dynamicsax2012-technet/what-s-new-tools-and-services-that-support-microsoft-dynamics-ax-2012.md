<td><p><strong>AxBuild.exe</strong> is available with the download for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 or cumulative update 7 or later for AX 2012 R2.</p></td>
<td><p>The <strong>AxBuild.exe</strong> utility program enables you to accomplish a full compile of all the X++ code on your system much faster than you can with the MorphX client. <strong>AxBuild.exe</strong> is run at a command prompt on a computer that hosts the Application Object Server (AOS). This approach eliminates the burden of transferring metadata between the AOS and the client. Also, <strong>AxBuild.exe</strong> starts several parallel processes and divides pieces of the full compile among them.</p>
