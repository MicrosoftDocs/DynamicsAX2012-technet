Use this procedure to create a purchase order based on a delivery schedule in a sales order.

### Create a purchase order from a sales order delivery schedule

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Common** \> **Sales orders** \> **All sales orders**.

2.  Select your sales order and double-click to open it. The **Sales order** form is displayed.

3.  In the Action Pane, on the **Sales order** tab, click **Purchase order**. The **Create purchase order** form is displayed. It shows all the associated order lines. This includes the delivery lines from the selected sales order.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can also create a direct delivery order if you want your vendor to deliver the goods to the customer. On the <STRONG>Sales order</STRONG> tab, click <STRONG>Direct delivery</STRONG>, and follow steps 4 and 5.</P>



4.  To select the delivery lines that you want to transfer to the purchase order, click the **Include** check box for each line, or click the **Include all** check box in the header of the form.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>In the same process, you can also transfer other order lines that might be part of your sales order.</P>



5.  Click **OK** to create the new purchase order, and return to the sales order.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Only the individual delivery lines will be transferred to the new purchase order, not all of the delivery schedule.</P>
