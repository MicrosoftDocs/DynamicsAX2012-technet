Employers need to know when their employees are being injured or becoming ill due to hazards in the workplace.

Use the injury and illness form to set up the necessary information to report work-place injuries or illnesses. You can set up types of injuries and illnesses, including types of treatments, costs, and outcomes. You also can set up the parts of the body, severity levels, and agencies to report information to.

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Setup** \> **Workers** \> **Injury and illness**.

2.  Select the type of information to set up and enter the details in the grid.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>(USA) Default information is included, such as injury or illness types, costs, and outcome types only when the United States country/region configuration key or the United States and Canada country/region configuration key is selected.</P>

    
    You cannot delete the default information.
