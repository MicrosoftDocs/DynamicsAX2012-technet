# (NOR) Set up the file types and parameters to archive files 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can archive a copy of the bank files that are received during the electronic banking process to a database. When you have to run the electronic banking process another time, you can use the archived files that are stored in the database.

The analyzing process decodes the format, and the information in the file is displayed with leading titles and positions. The bank files that are archived in the database are in a readable format so that you can analyze and review them before they are sent to the bank. You can analyze how the file is structured, the sequence of various fields, and count positions.

1.  Click **System administration** \> **Setup** \> **File archiving** \> **File types**.

2.  Create a new file type.

3.  Enter the extension of the file type to archive to the database in the **File type** field. The extension must be followed by a period.
