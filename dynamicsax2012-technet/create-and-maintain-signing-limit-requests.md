# Create and maintain signing limit requests 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Signing limits constrain the financial commitments that a worker is authorized to make or approve on behalf of the employer. A worker can have different signing limits for different document types, such as purchase requisitions, expense reports, purchase orders, and invoices. As a direct result of the workerâ€™s spending or approval activity, his employer may enter into a contractual relationship with a third party. For example, a purchase order may be issued to a vendor.

Signing limits can be limited to workers who have an employee record in Microsoft Dynamics AX. This ensures that only employees, and not contract workers, are granted signing limits.

For more information about signing limits, see [About signing limits](about-signing-limits.md).
