# Key tasks: Set up vendor category requests 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Vendors who are approved to do business in a procurement category in your organization might want to extend their business to additional procurement categories. The vendor makes the category application request in the Vendor portal in Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX.

Employees can also submit a request to allow vendors to do business in additional categories. The employee creates the request on the **Category request** page in the Employee services portal in Enterprise Portal.

Vendor category applications and employee category requests are routed, via workflow, to an approver. If an application or request is approved, a category confirmation is sent to the vendor. The vendor must complete the application and submit it for approval. If the application or request is rejected, the status of the request in the Employee services portal will change to **Request rejected**.

Before the vendor can create a category application, you must set up the required and optional fields on the category application page that appears in the Vendor portal. You must also set up the employee category request page and the vendor category confirmation page.

A default profile is available for each page. The default profile is displayed for all countries/regions. You can create a custom profile for specific countries/regions.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You cannot select a country/region for the default profile.</P>
