# About user roles 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

As a vendor portal administrator, you must specify a role for each user when you submit a new user request. The user role that you assign to a user determines their level of access and their ability to act on information in the Vendor portal. You can assign an employee to either the **Vendor portal administrator** user role or the **Vendor** user role.

Users who are assigned the **Vendor portal administrator** user role can perform the following tasks in the Vendor portal:

  - View the vendor profile.

  - Create requests to add or delete users.

  - Maintain procurement catalogs.

  - View purchase orders and requests for quotations.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The first contact for a vendor is automatically assigned to the <STRONG>Vendor portal administrator</STRONG> user role.</P>



Users who are assigned the **Vendor** user role can perform the following tasks in the Vendor portal:

  - Maintain the vendor profile.

  - Update invoices.

  - Submit requests to allow the vendor to do business in additional procurement categories.

  - Submit confirmations that the vendor can do business in the additional procurement categories that are outlined in a vendor category extension request that was submitted by an employee.

  - Reply to requests for quotations.

  - Respond to purchase orders. From the vendorâ€™s perspective, these are sales orders.

  - View purchase order confirmations.

  - View product receipt journals.
