# (RUS) Calculating production costs 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Companies can calculate the cost of production for items and maintain journals for production costs. The cost of a production order is distributed among works in progress (WIP), by-products, defective products, and finished items.

You can complete the following tasks:

  - Use the by-product journal to register by-products and defective products that are generated from a production order.

  - Create and post storno transactions to the general ledger when the status of a production order is updated and its cost is calculated.

  - Calculate the cost of a production order by using the normative method or the proportional method.
    
      - **Normative method** – The costs of WIP and by-products are calculated by using the standard costs for each operation.
    
      - **Proportional allocation method** – The costs of WIP and by-products are calculated by using actual costs.
