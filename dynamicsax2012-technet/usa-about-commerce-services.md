# (USA) About Commerce Services 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Organizations can use Commerce Services for Microsoft Dynamics ERP to sell products easily through online stores that they create, and through established marketplaces such as eBay. Catalogs and product listings are centrally managed, and sales orders flow seamlessly back into Microsoft Dynamics AX for processing.

Commerce Services provides the following benefits:

  - The ability to sell through multiple channels by extending your sales presence to your own online store and online marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, and others.

  - Seamless inventory management between Microsoft Dynamics AX and the online store. Changes in stock levels are automatically reflected in the online store.

  - Seamless payments between Microsoft Dynamics AX and the online store. With Commerce Services, payment processing is integrated between an organizationâ€™s online shopping cart and its back-office software.

  - Seamless order management between Microsoft Dynamics AX and the online store. Commerce Services ties together online customer acquisition efforts and back-office order fulfillment.
