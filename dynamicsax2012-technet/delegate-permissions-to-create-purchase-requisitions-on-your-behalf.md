# Delegate permissions to create purchase requisitions on your behalf 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can delegate one or more workers to order products and create purchase requisitions on your behalf. Authorization is granted to the worker from the date that you enter the authorization until the authorization expires.

If an administrator has granted permissions to another worker on your behalf, the **Granted by administrator** check box is selected.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Depending on your role or the privileges that are assigned to you, you might need to go to your Employee services site before you complete the procedures in this topic.</P>



1.  Click **Order Products** on the top link bar, and then click **Delegate permissions** on the Quick Launch.

2.  On the **Delegates who can order products on our behalf** page, on the **Action Pane**, on the **Purchase requisition permission** tab, click **Delegate**.

3.  On the **New delegate** page, select a worker to whom you want to grant permission to order products and create purchase requisitions on your behalf. The Unified Worklist notifies the worker that they have been given permission to order products and create purchase requisitions on your behalf.

4.  To remove the authorization for a worker to order products and create purchase requisition, on the **Delegates who can order products on our behalf** page, on the **Action Pane**, click **Expire**. The expiration date is set to the current date.

5.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 to add more workers as delegates.
