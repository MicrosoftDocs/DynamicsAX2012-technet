# Assign a rate and route to a load 


This topic explains how to assign a rate and route to an inbound or outbound load.

## This task is part of a bigger process

This topic describes how to assign a rate and route to an inbound load and outbound load so that the rate can relate to other tasks in the transportation planning for loads. The tasks of assigning a rate and route to an inbound and outbound load are similar, the only differences are the origin of the load. An inbound load is generated by a purchase order or a transfer order, and an outbound load is generated by a sales order. In the **Load planning workbench** form, you select the sales order line, transfer order line, or purchase order line.

For an overview of these processes, see [Business process: Planning transportation for inbound loads](business-process-planning-transportation-for-inbound-loads.md) and [Business process: Planning and processing outbound loads for shipping](business-process-planning-and-processing-outbound-loads-for-shipping.md).
