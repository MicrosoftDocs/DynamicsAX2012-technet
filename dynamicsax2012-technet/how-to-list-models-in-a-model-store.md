[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This topic describes how to list the models that are in the model store. You can use either Windows PowerShell cmdlets or the AXUtil command-line utility to perform this task.

### Validate permissions

  - Validate that you have appropriate permissions to work with the model store:
    
      - Administrative permissions on the local computer
    
      - System Administrator rights in Microsoft Dynamics AX
    
      - In Microsoft SQL Server:
        
          - Membership in the Securityadmin server role on the SQL Server instance
        
          - Membership in the db\_owner role in the Microsoft Dynamics AX database

### List models (Windows PowerShell)

1.  To list the models in a layer, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, PS C:\\\>, type the following command, and then press ENTER.
    
    ``` powershell
    Get-AXModel -Layer <LayerName>
    ```

2.  To list the models in the model store, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, PS C:\\\>, type the following command, and then press ENTER.
    
        Get-AXModel
    
    For more information, see [Get-AXModel](get-axmodel.md).

### List models (AXUtil)

2.  Navigate to the directory for the management utilities. Typically, the location of this directory is %ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft Dynamics AX\\60\\ManagementUtilities.

3.  To list the models in a layer, at the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER.
    
        axutil list /layer
        :<layername>

        axutil list
