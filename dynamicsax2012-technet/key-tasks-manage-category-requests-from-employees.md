# Key tasks: Manage category requests from employees 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When a vendor is approved to provide items and services to your legal entity, the vendor is authorized to provide them only in specific procurement categories. Employees can request that a vendor be authorized to do business in additional procurement categories. Requests are submitted in the Employee services site in Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX.

Category requests include the procurement categories and a justification for the request to add those categories. The request is routed via workflow to an approver. When the request is approved, the vendor is sent a request to confirm their ability to supply items and services in the requested categories.

Category requests are displayed on the **Vendor requests** list page in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client. The status of the category request appears on the list page and changes as the request is processed in workflow. For more information, see [About workflow statuses for category extension requests](about-workflow-statuses-for-category-extension-requests.md).
