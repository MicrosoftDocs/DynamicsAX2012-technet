# About absence administration 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

To maintain absence information for your organization, absence administrators must complete the following tasks periodically:

  - Maintain absence registration rules.

  - Set up absence information for new workers.

  - Register or request absences for workers.

  - Approve or reject absence requests and registrations.

The person who is specified for each absence setup is the absence administrator. For more information, see [Key task: Set up absence information](key-task-set-up-absence-information.md).

Successful absence administration depends on how you set up absence information for your organization. For more information see, [Setting up absence information](setting-up-absence-information.md).

## Absence registration rules

For each absence code, you can create rules that specify how the absence code can be used. If you are an absence administrator, you might have to maintain the absence registration rules. For more information, see [Key task: Set up absence information](key-task-set-up-absence-information.md).

Use the **Absence administration** form to see a list of workers who have violated the absence registration rules that you set up.

## Absence information for new workers

Each time that you hire a new worker, you must specify absence information for that worker. For more information, see [Specify absence information for a worker](specify-absence-information-for-a-worker.md).

## Enter absence registrations and requests for workers

If some workers do not have access to Microsoft Dynamics AX or Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX, a manager or an absence administrator must enter absence registrations and requests for those workers. For more information, see [Register absences](register-absences.md).

## Approve or reject absence requests and registrations

If you are an absence administrator, you must periodically review the absence requests and registrations that must be approved. For more information, see [Approve or reject absences](approve-or-reject-absences.md).
