# Set up mobile device user accounts for workers 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic applies to features in the <STRONG>Warehouse management</STRONG> module. It does not apply to features in the <A href="inventory-management.md">Inventory management</A> module.</P>



This procedure describes how to set up a user account for a warehouse worker to access a mobile device. This involves setting up a worker as a work user, selecting the mobile device menus that the worker can access, and specifying their log on information. You can create multiple work users for each worker.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>All of the work users that have been created for the worker must use the same language. The work user inherits the language setting from the worker through the user relation, which inherits the setting from the user. If a language is not specified for the worker or user, then the default language setting is the Active Directory service account that is used by the Warehouse Mobile Device Portal process to access Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3.</P>



## Set up user accounts for workers

To set up a worker as a work user, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Warehouse management** \> **Setup** \> **Work users** \> **Worker**.

2.  In the **Worker** column, select the worker, or click **New** to create a new work user.

3.  Optional: On the **Worker** FastTab, assign a packing profile and a container closing profile to the worker. For more information, see [Set up packing and container closing profiles for manual pack process](set-up-packing-and-container-closing-profiles-for-manual-pack-process.md).

4.  On the **Users** FastTab, in the **User ID** field, enter a unique identifier that the work user will use to log on to a mobile device.

5.  In the **User name** field, enter a short name for the user.

6.  In the **Default warehouse** field, select the warehouse in which the mobile device is used. The warehouse is displayed every time that the user logs on to the mobile device.

7.  In the **Menu name** field, select the mobile device menu that the work user can access.

8.  Press **Ctrl+S** on the keyboard to save the settings and open the **Set password** dialog box, where you can enter a password for the user.

9.  Optional: To block or suspend access to the mobile device menu, select the **Inactive** check box.

10. Optional: To grant the work user access to additional warehouses, click **Warehouses**.

11. Optional: On the **Work** FastTab, enter additional settings.
