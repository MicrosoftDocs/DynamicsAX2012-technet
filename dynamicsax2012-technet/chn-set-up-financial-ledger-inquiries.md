Major ledger inquiries are also called account books. According to the Chinese Accounting System and the Account Archived Management Principle, all account books must be printed in a specific format and must be stored for 15 years, along with the vouchers and reports. In accordance with the CBAJS (Chinese Basic Accounting Job Specification), an account book must have links to connect to other account books.

You can print various inquiry reports on both preprinted papers and plain papers with a specific format.
