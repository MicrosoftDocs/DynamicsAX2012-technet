# Setting up and maintaining journals 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A journal is a chronological list of transactions, in the form of debits and credits, for a particular account or group of accounts.

The journals in General ledger include the **General journal**.

You find journals in several other modules. You set up and use the **General journal** according to the same principles that govern all journals.

In the journals, you prepare manual transactions in a type of worksheet. You can create entries, but you do not have to post them immediately. The lines of the journal can be reviewed, changed, verified, and approved before they are posted and become actual transactions in ledger accounts.

The following topics provide information about setting up and maintaining journals.
