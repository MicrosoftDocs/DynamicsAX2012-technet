# Create a catch weight item with full visibility 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use this procedure to create a catch weight item with full visibility. A catch weight item with full visibility requires that each unit of inventory is assigned a unique serial number and that the specific weight of the inventory unit is recorded. A unique serial number is associated with the weight of the inventory unit.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>When an item that is designated as a catch weight item is released, the designation can only be changed if you delete the item in all the companies where it exists.</P>
