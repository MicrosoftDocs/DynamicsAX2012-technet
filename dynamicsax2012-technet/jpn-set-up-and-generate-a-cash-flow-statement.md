# (JPN) Set up and generate a cash flow statement 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can set up cash flow statements to display cash inflow and outflow for a specified financial period. A cash flow statement includes the following information:

  - The cash inflow and outflow.

  - The cash amount at the beginning, and at the end of the financial period.

  - The changes in cash amount at the beginning, and at the end of the financial period.

The detailed cash flow statement also includes sales order transactions, production manufacturing, fixed asset investments, and common stock cash dividends. The cash flow statement retrieves the required information from the dimensions table, ledger table, ledger transactions, and the calculated cash flow from the transaction amounts.

Use the following procedures to set up and generate a cash flow statement in the Japanese format.

## Set up a cash flow statement
