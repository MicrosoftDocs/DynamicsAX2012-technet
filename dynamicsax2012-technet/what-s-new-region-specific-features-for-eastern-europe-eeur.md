<td><p>Pre-acquisition handling of fixed assets</p></td>
<td><p>In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, asset acquisition can be split into two separate steps, each of which has its own general ledger (GL) postings and fixed asset updates. Therefore, separate GL entries can be recorded when the asset is expensed, and when it is put into use. Depreciation is not permitted for assets that are still in the first step of the process (the Pre-acquisition stage). Pre-acquisition amounts can be viewed at the asset level.</p>
