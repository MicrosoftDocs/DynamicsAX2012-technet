<td><p>Retail</p></td>
<td><p>AX 2012 Feature Pack includes the <strong>Retail</strong> module, which adds features and feature updates to Microsoft Dynamics AX for Retail 2009.

<ul>
<li><p>You can categorize products by using an n-level deep category hierarchy, so that you can more efficiently categorize your retail products.</p></li>
<li><p>You can use the enhancements to products, category hierarchies, and organization hierarchies to more efficiently create and maintain assortments.</p></li>
