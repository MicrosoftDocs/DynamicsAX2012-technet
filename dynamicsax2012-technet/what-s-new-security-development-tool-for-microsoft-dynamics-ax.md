# What's new: Security Development Tool for Microsoft Dynamics AX 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The Security Development Tool for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 is intended to help you more easily create and maintain security artifacts such as roles, duties, and privileges. The tool displays entry point permissions for a given role, duty, or privilege. Additional tools guide you through updates of the access levels for entry points. You can also use the tool to test a newly created or newly modified security role, duty, or privilege from the same interface, without using a different test user account. Additionally, you can use the tool to record business process flows and identify the entry points that are used.

## November 2014 Update

In November 2014, in an effort to streamline the number of sites that partners and customers need to access, we decommissioned the InformationSource site.

  - The Security Development Tool has been moved from InformationSource to the new Downloadable tools section of Lifecycle Services, which is available in the new preview interface, at the far right. To use the new interface, add V2 to your default URL, using the following pattern:
    
    https://lcs.dynamics.com/V2/ProjectDashboard/yourprojectID
    
    [Go to Lifecycle Services](https://lcs.dynamics.com)

  - The content has moved to CustomerSource. Start [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=518079) to find conference content, whitepapers, datasheets, and how-to videos.
    
    All content on CustomerSource is now indexed by Bing and other external search engines, so you can find content just by searching. You will still be required to log in to access the content.
