# About adding clock-out registrations 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

If workers forget to clock out at the end of their work day, you can create clock-out registrations for them by running a batch job. This helps make sure that calculations include all clock-out registrations. You must run the batch job before you calculate information about worker registrations.

## Adding clock-out registrations

On the specified date, the batch job searches for clock-out registrations. When a missing registration is found, the following occurs:

  - If a worker does not have a clock-in registration before the profile end time, and no registrations exist after the end time, the batch job adds a clock-out registration at the profile end time.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The profile end time is the end of the work day according to the workerâ€™s work time profile. For example, if a day profile is set up with an expected clock-in time at 07:00 and an expected clock-out time at 15:00, then 15:00 is the profile end time.</P>



  - If a clock-in registration or a job registration is after the end time specified on the workers profile, then the worker has worked overtime. In this case, the batch job does not add a clock-out registration.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can also create clock-out registrations for a worker in the <STRONG>Calculate</STRONG> form and the <STRONG>Approve</STRONG> form.</P>
