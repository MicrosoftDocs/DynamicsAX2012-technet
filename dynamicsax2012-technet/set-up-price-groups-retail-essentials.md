# Set up price groups (Retail essentials) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to set up price groups in Retail essentials. A price group helps you manage prices and discounts for retail products in specific channels, catalogs, affiliations, and loyalty programs. For example, you can create a price group that is named **Student** and use this price group to link several discounts to specific stores and to an affiliation.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Retail essentials, the form that you use to complete this task includes a subset of the controls that are available for other configurations of Retail. If a topic about this form describes controls that you don't see, it may be because youâ€™re using Retail essentials.</P>



To create a price group, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Retail essentials** \> **Merchandising** \> **Setup** \> **Price and discount setup** \> **Price groups**.

2.  In the **Price groups** form, click **New** to create a new price group.

3.  In the **Price groups** field, enter a unique ID number for the price group, and then, in the **Name** field, enter a descriptive name for the price group.

4.  If the price group is exclusively a retail price group, select the **Retail** check box. Only retail price groups are available for retail-specific discounts.

5.  Optional: If you want to view or create trade agreements that assign special pricing to particular channels, customers, or customer groups, click **Trade agreements**.
