# Generate and print shelf labels 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

This topic explains how to generate and print shelf labels to put on a store rack or shelf where items are displayed or stored. A shelf label can contain all the information about the product, for example the product name, size, and color. However, a shelf label can’t contain information such as the batch number, serial number, or expiration date.

When you work with labels in Retail, you can do the following:

  - Create shelf labels when the price or comparison price of a product has changed in a store.
    
    To set up Retail to create shelf labels when prices change, you must assign shelf label reports to the relevant retail products. The shelf label reports provide the information that Retail needs to print the labels. You must set up shelf label reports no matter what version of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 you are using.

  - Create shelf labels manually, either for one product at a time or for categories of retail products.

  - In AX 2012 R3, you can generate shelf labels for multiple products at the same time. You can also generate shelf labels for products that are included in purchase orders, transfer orders and for released products.

  - Select a specific size for the shelf labels that you print.

  - Reprint labels at any time.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The procedure for completing this task has changed for <STRONG>Retail</STRONG> in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3. For more information, see the section later in this topic.</P>



## Prerequisites

Before you can generate and print shelf labels, you must set up Microsoft Dynamics AX to enable label printing. The following tasks must be completed:

  - Select options in the **Retail shared parameters** form to specify how labels should be generated for brick-and-mortar stores. For more information about the options in this form, see [Retail shared parameters (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh580625\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Select the reports that can be used to generate labels. The label reports contain information such as bar codes, prices, and relevant data, and also specify the size of the labels to print and the orientation of the label page. After label reports are set up in this step, users select which report to use every time they generate labels.

## Specify which stores to print labels for

Follow these steps to specify which stores you want to print labels for. You can select whether to generate labels for all stores or only selected stores. This setting only applies to brick-and-mortar stores.

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Parameters** \> **Retail shared parameters**.

2.  In the **Retail shared parameters** form, on the **Labels** tab, select the option to use when generating labels.

## Set up shelf label reports

Follow these steps to set up the reports that users can select when they generate labels:

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Bar codes and labels** \> **Shelf label reports**.

2.  In the **Shelf label report setup** form, on the **Overview** tab, in the **Report name** field, select the shelf label report to use. Add as many shelf label reports as you require for your products.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The <STRONG>Report name</STRONG> field contains a list of the reports that are available in the AOT. Based on the requirements of the business, you can also create new reports and add them to the list of reports that are available in the AOT.</P>



For more information about how to assign shelf label reports to products, see [Set up retail products](set-up-retail-products.md).
