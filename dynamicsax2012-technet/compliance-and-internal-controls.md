# Compliance and internal controls 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The Compliance and internal controls module of Microsoft Dynamics AX includes Environmental sustainability and Audit functionality.

## Environmental sustainability

The Environmental sustainability dashboard helps you to determine your company’s environmental footprint. By using the dashboard, you can track incoming raw materials and energy consumption. You can then calculate and record the flow of finished products to customers and hazardous emissions into the environment. When you adjust the way that your company views consumption, you can:

  - Evaluate your company’s current effect on the environment.

  - Identify opportunities to reduce your company’s environmental footprint.

  - Calculate and record the flow of potentially hazardous substances into nature.

  - Implement environmentally sustainable practices.

  - Maintain preferred vendor status with customers.

The following process flow illustrates the Environmental sustainability dashboard business process.

## Compliance and internal controls

In business, compliance generally refers to the requirement to follow certain rules or laws, meet certain standards, and follow certain practices. Compliance standards can originate from external or internal sources, and a compliance requirement can be mandatory or optional. From tax reporting forms to how you place a label on a box for a customer, compliance requirements help drive the ways in which businesses operate.

The **Compliance** site provides a central location for users in your organization to manage the internal controls, business process content, and reporting for your organization's compliance program.
