To comply with the National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) operating rules, the RBC Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) format includes new address records for both the originator of a payment and the customer or recipient of the payment. If the payment transaction originates from or is transmitted to a financial agency outside the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S., it is classified as an International ACH Transaction (IAT) by the RBC.

To generate an RBC transmission file, first create a payment journal for a customer or vendor.
