# Create sales targets 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Periodic** \> **Sales management** \> **Sales target**.

2.  On the left pane, expand the sales unit, and then select the members of the sales unit for whom you want to create sales targets.

3.  On the **Overview** tab, press CTRL+N to create a new line.

4.  Enter the date for the sales target.

5.  Enter the target amount. Use the company currency for the selected fiscal year.
    
    Microsoft Dynamics AX automatically calculates the quarterly and monthly targets by dividing the total yearly sales target by 4 for the quarterly sales targets and by 12 for the monthly sales targets.
    
    You can modify the quarterly or monthly amounts directly. Manually enter the values in the fields. The program automatically calculates the yearly total.
