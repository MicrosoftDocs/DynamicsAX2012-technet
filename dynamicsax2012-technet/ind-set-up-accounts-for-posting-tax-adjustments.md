The amounts are temporarily posted to the system accounts before they are finally posted to the main accounts in your chart of accounts.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a new posting type for the tax amounts that are adjusted.

3.  In the **Posting type** field, select **Tax adjustment â€“ Settlement**.

4.  In the **Main account** field, select the main account to temporarily post the tax adjustment amount to.
