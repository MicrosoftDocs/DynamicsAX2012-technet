# About main account types 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The following main account types determine how a main account is used in the chart of accounts. You must select a main account type when you create a main account in the **Main accounts - chart of accounts: %1** form.

  - **Profit and loss**, **Revenue**, and **Expense** – These main accounts are used as posting accounts. **Profit and loss** accounts are used to record revenue and expenses. The sum of all operating accounts determines the year-end results. **Revenue** and **Expense** main accounts have the same function as **Profit and loss** main accounts.

  - **Balance sheet**, **Asset**, **Liability**, and **Equity** – These main accounts are used as transaction accounts to record the amounts that a legal entity owns or owes. If you use **Asset**, **Liability**, and **Equity** main accounts, the accounts can have more specification, and you can more precisely structure reports about the balance of the legal entity.

  - **Total** – These main accounts are used to add account intervals. Configure the **Total** main account type by using the **Sales tax totals** form, which displays the total of the group balances for all account intervals.

  - **Reporting** – These main accounts are used for financial statement reporting.

  - **Common** – These main accounts are for accounts that are used in banks or financial institutions in China. Accounts that have a **Common** main account type are recorded as assets if the balance is positive and as liabilities if the balance is negative. An example of an account that has the **Common** main account type is a currency hedging account.
