This topic describes how to prevent information about workers, who are no longer active, from being included in calculations and approvals for registrations in **Time and attendance**. For example, workers are no longer active after their employment has been terminated.

To deactivate a worker, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Periodic** \> **Time and attendance** \> **Update** \> **Deactivate past workers**.

2.  Optional: Enter settings for the batch job.

3.  Click **OK**.
