# Fields, methods, and return values in queries [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

By creating queries from the management statistics section in **Sales and marketing**, you can view a plotted graph that shows both the fields and the methods of many tables in Microsoft Dynamics AX.

Before you can start, an administrator must enter into the **Query administration** form the tables that you want to include in the queries for management statistics. After this configuration is completed, you can start to create queries, provided that you have the appropriate permissions.

To you create a query by using the management statistics function, select the appropriate field or method and the return value.

In the **Queries** form, the fields that the administrator enabled can be entered in the fields for either the x-axis or the y-axis. However, the y-axis can contain only fields that contain real numbers, whereas the x-axis can contain any field that you select. By default, the field name is the Application Object Tree (AOT) name, but you can change this name at any time.

The methods that are enabled are used similarly to the fields. However, the methods can appear only on the y-axis.

You can specify various formats for the return value of the query. For example, the return value can be displayed as a total, an average, or a count.
