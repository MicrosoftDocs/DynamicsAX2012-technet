## Install Management Reporter

Use this procedure to install Management Reporter. If you install other Microsoft Dynamics AX components at the same time, the installation pages vary, depending on the components that you are installing.

1.  Start Microsoft Dynamics AX Setup. Under **Install**, select **Microsoft Dynamics AX components**.

2.  Advance through the first wizard pages.

3.  If the Setup Support files have not yet been installed on this computer, the **Select a file location** page is displayed. The Setup Support files are required for installation. Provide a file location or accept the default location, and then click **Next**. On the **Ready to install** page, click **Install**.

4.  If you’re installing AX 2012 R3, in the **Select an installation option** page, click **Microsoft Dynamics AX**.

5.  On the **Select installation type** page, click **Custom installation**, and then click **Next**.

6.  On the **Select components** page, select **Management Reporter**, and then click **Next**.

7.  On the **Connect Management Reporter to an AOS instance** page, enter the name, TCP/IP port, and services endpoint port of the instance of Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Object Server (AOS) to use together with Management Reporter. By default, AOS uses port 2712 for TCP/IP communication and port 8201 for the services endpoint.
    
    Click **Next**.

8.  On the **Connect Management Reporter to a database** page, select the server name and database where Microsoft Dynamics AX transaction data is located. Reporting will be enabled for the database that you select. The Management Reporter database will also be created on the selected server.
    
    Click **Next**.

9.  On the **Select a service account** page, enter the account to run the Management Reporter Windows service, and then click **Next**.

10. On the **Configure Management Reporter** page, enter the following information:

      - The name of the data mart database.
    
    Click **Next**.

11. On the **Configure an integration user** page, enter information about the user account that is used to integrate data between Management Reporter and Microsoft Dynamics AX. If the user does not already exist in Microsoft Dynamics AX, select **Create new account**. The user will be added, and the Microsoft Dynamics AX user ID will be *AxIntUsr*. If the user already exists in Microsoft Dynamics AX, select **Use existing account**, and enter a user ID. Click **Next**.

12. On the **Prerequisite validation results** page, resolve any errors. For more information about how to resolve prerequisite errors, see [Check prerequisites](check-prerequisites.md). When no errors remain, click **Next**.

13. On the **Ready to install** page, click **Install**.

14. After the installation is completed, click **Finish** to close the wizard.
    

    > [!NOTE]
