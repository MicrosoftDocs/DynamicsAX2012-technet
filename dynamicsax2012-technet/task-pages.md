You can use task pages to complete tasks in Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX, such as modifying records. You can open task pages from links or menus on other types of pages, such as list pages or entity overview pages. You can also open task pages from other task pages.

Task pages may include a toolbar, which you can use to complete related tasks or view related information. The options on the toolbar are specific to each page. Task pages can also include other elements, such as lists. For more information, see [Common page elements](common-page-elements.md).
