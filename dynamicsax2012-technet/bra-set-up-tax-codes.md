You can set up a default taxation code that is used for a sales tax code when you create the sales tax code, attach the sales tax code to a sales tax group, or attach the sales tax code to an item sales tax groups.

## Specify mandatory tax types

Use this procedure to specify which tax types require taxation codes.

2.  Click **Taxation code**, and then in the **Taxation code** area, select the **Mandatory** check box for each tax that requires a taxation code.

## Set up taxation codes

You can set up Sistema Público de Escrituração Digital (SPED) taxation codes that are used when you set up sales tax codes, sales tax groups, and item sales tax groups. You can specify fiscal values for the taxation codes. You can specify the SPED code, input taxation code, and output taxation code for the Imposto sobre Produtos Industrializados (IPI) tax type.

4.  In the **Tax type** field, select the type of tax for the taxation code.

5.  In the **Taxation code** and **Description** fields, enter the SPED taxation code and its description.

6.  In the **Fiscal value** field, select one of the following options to indicate the fiscal value of the taxation code:
    
      - **1. with credit/debit** – The transactions of the selected tax type are booked as credit in incoming fiscal documents or debit in outgoing fiscal documents. The calculated base and tax amounts are included as the taxable base amount and actual sales tax amount.
    
      - **2. without credit/debit (exempt or not taxable)** – The transactions of the selected tax type are not taxable. The tax base amount is included as the exempt base amount.
    
      - **3. without credit/debit (other)** – The transactions of the selected tax type are without credit in incoming fiscal documents or debit in outgoing fiscal documents. Tax is calculated but not booked separately. The calculated base and tax amounts are included as other base and other tax amounts.
