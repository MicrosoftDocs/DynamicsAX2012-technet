# Setting up bar codes (Retail essentials) 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

The topics in this section provide information about how to create bar codes. You can use bar codes to track inventory at the point of sale and in the warehouse. You can also use bar codes to manage loyalty cards, gift cards, and credit memos.

Products can have more than one bar code. For example, a product may have multiple bar codes if it comes from various manufacturers, or if it has a bar code from the manufacturer and an in-house bar code that you create. Bar codes can also include the weight or price of the product.

If you have products with variants, such as a shirt that comes in different sizes, colors, and styles, you can assign a bar code to each variant combination to track inventory more precisely and view sales statistics by variant. Retail essentials uses a bar code mask to generate bar codes automatically for each variant combination.

For information about how to print bar codes on labels, see [Print product labels (Retail essentials)](print-product-labels-retail-essentials.md).
