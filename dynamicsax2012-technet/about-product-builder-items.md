# About product builder items 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Before you can create a product model for an item, you must make the item configurable. This topic provides information about configurable items and how to make an item configurable.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This information applies only to Product builder.</P>



## Configurable items

The items that a production company would typically want to make configurable with the **Product Builder**, that is, configurable as an integrated part of the sales, purchase or production process, are those items that are sold and made to order. These are items for which the customer has some choices on the configuration of the finished product, in short, any finished items that are not stock items.

Each configurable item must be created in the **Released products** form as a type of item and with the **Modeling enabled** check box selected. Any other items that should be part of the bill of materials (BOM) must also be created in the **Released products** form, exactly as one would do for a standard BOM to which other items will be connected by way of the BOM lines.
