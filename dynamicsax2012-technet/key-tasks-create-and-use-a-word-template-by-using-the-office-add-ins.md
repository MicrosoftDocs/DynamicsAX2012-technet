# Key tasks: Create and use a Word template by using the Office Add-ins 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use the Office Add-ins for Microsoft Dynamics AX to export information from Microsoft Dynamics AX to Microsoft Word. If your organization uses the Office Add-ins, a tab for Microsoft Dynamics AX is added to the ribbon in Word.

The Office Add-in for Word lets you create document templates that you can reuse. If your organization uses a template library, you can share the Word template with other workers by saving your template into the template library.

The data that you can include in a document template is limited by the permissions that are associated with your assigned role. Generally, if you can view and modify specific data in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client, you can view, add, and modify the same data in a template. If you share a template with other workers, those workers must also have permission to view and modify the data in the shared template.
