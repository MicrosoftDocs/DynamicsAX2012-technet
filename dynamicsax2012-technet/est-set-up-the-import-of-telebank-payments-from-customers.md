You can import telebank payments from customers into the accounts receivable payment journal by using either of the generally accepted telebanking formats, Teleteenus (EE) v. 2.3 or Telehansa (EE) v. 5.116. The imported payments are linked to customers or to specific invoices by using reference numbers.

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Payment** \> **Methods of payment**.

2.  Select a method of payment. To create a method of payment, click **New**, and then enter the required details. For more information, see [Methods of payment - customers (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa499398\(v=ax.60\)).

4.  On the **Import** tab, in the **Available** list, select **Telehansa (EE) v. 5.116**. Click **\<** to add this file format to the **Selected** list.
