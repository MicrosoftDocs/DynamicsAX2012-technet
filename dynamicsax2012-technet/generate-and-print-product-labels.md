# Generate and print product labels 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

This topic explains how to generate and print product labels that you can attach to a product or a container. A product label contains all the information about the product, including the batch number, serial number, and expiration date.

When you work with labels in Retail, you can do the following:

  - Create labels for products for which the price or comparison price has changed in a store.
    
    To set up Retail to create product labels when prices change, you must assign product label reports to the relevant retail products. The product label reports provide the information that Retail needs to print the labels. You must set up product label reports no matter what version of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 you are using.

  - Create product labels manually, either for one product at a time or for categories of retail products.

  - In AX 2012 R3, generate product label files for multiple products at the same time.

  - Select a specific size for the product labels that you print.

  - Reprint labels at any time.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The procedure for completing this task has changed for <STRONG>Retail</STRONG> in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3. For more information, see the section later in this topic.</P>



## Prerequisites

Before you can generate and print product labels, you must set up Microsoft Dynamics AX to enable label printing. The following tasks must be completed:

  - Select options in the **Retail shared parameters** form to specify how labels should be generated for brick-and-mortar stores. For more information about the options in this form, see [Retail shared parameters (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh580625\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Select the reports that can be used to generate labels. The label reports contain information such as bar codes, prices, and relevant dates, and also specify the size of the labels to print and the orientation of the label page. After label reports are set up in this step, users select which report to use every time they generate labels.

## Specify which stores to print labels for

Follow these steps to specify which stores you want to print labels for. You can select whether to generate labels for all stores or only selected stores. This setting only applies to brick-and-mortar stores.

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Parameters** \> **Retail shared parameters**.

2.  In the **Retail shared parameters** form, on the **Labels** tab, select the option to use when generating labels.

## Set up product label reports

Follow these steps to set up the reports that users can select when they generate labels:

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Bar codes and labels** \> **Product label reports**.

2.  In the **Product label report setup** form, in the **Report name** field, click the arrow and select the product label reports to use. Add as many product label reports as you require for your products.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The <STRONG>Report name</STRONG> field contains a list of the reports that are available in the Application Object Tree (AOT). Based on the requirements of the business, you can also create new reports and add them to the list of available reports.</P>



## Generate and print product labels

To generate and print labels that you can attach to a product or a container, follow these steps:

      - In AX 2012 R3 click **Labels to print**.
    
      - Otherwise, click **Transactions**, and then click **Labels to print**.

      - In AX 2012 R3 click **Print labels**.
    
      - Otherwise, click **Print**, and then click **Print labels**.

8.  Select the printer to use to print the product labels, and then click **OK**.
