You must select a fiscal calendar for every legal entity. For more information, see [Ledger (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh209331\(v=ax.60\)).

Fiscal calendars are created in the **Fiscal calendars** form. There is no limit to the number of fiscal calendars that you can create, and each one can be selected by multiple legal entities. For more information about fiscal calendars and how they can be used, see [About fiscal calendars, fiscal years, and periods](about-fiscal-calendars-fiscal-years-and-periods.md).
