You can select the fiscal calendar to use for the ledger in the **Ledger** form. This is the same form where you select the chart of accounts, accounting currency, and other ledger details.

Fiscal calendars are created in the **Fiscal calendars** form. There is no limit to the number of fiscal calendars that you can create, and each one can be selected by multiple legal entities. For more information about fiscal calendars and how they can be used, see [About fiscal calendars, fiscal years, and periods](about-fiscal-calendars-fiscal-years-and-periods.md).
