# What's new: Country/Region Context 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009 and earlier versions, country/region configuration keys were used to enable and display country/region-specific features. To control feature availability based on the location of the legal entity, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 uses the country/region that is associated with the legal entityâ€™s primary address. For example, if the address of the legal entity is in Canada, users can see and work with Canada-specific features.

## New functionality

Country/region-specific features are now enabled for each legal entity instead of each instance of Microsoft Dynamics AX. Therefore, for example, a single instance can have one legal entity that is located in Germany, for which German-specific functionality is enabled, and another legal entity that is located in Canada, for which Canada-specific functionality is enabled. In this case, the set of functionalities that is enabled for one legal entity does not affect the other legal entities.

Country/region context simplifies setup, because parameters are no longer required if you want to enable country/region-specific features. These features are implicitly enabled or disabled based on the address of the legal entity.

## Comparison with AX 2009

The way that country/region-specific features are enabled and displayed has changed.
