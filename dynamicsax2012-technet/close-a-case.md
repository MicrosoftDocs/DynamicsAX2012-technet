# Close a case 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When a case has been resolved, either internally with an employee or externally with a customer or vendor, you can close the case. The case record is saved, but the record is removed from the case list.

1.  Click **Home** \> **Common** \> **Cases** \> **All cases**.

2.  In the list, select the case that you want to resolve.

3.  In the **Maintain** group, click the **Change status** button and select **Closed**.
    
    When you close a case, the service level agreement (SLA) associated with the case is also closed. If a follow up activity is required for the case, an activity is created and you will receive a prompt to complete the activity.
