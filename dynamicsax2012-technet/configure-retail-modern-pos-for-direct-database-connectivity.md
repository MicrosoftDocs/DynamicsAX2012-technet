# Configure Retail Modern POS for direct database connectivity 


This topic explains how to configure direct database connectivity for Retail Modern POS by using the Retail Channel Configuration Utility.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic does not apply to versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 prior to AX 2012 R3 Cumulative Update 8.</P>



Retail Modern POS can be configured to connect to a channel database either directly or through Retail Server. Offline mode is supported for both deployment options. For more information about supported deployment topologies, see [Retail Modern POS architecture](retail-modern-pos-architecture.md).

On each device where you want to configure direct database connectivity, you must use the Microsoft Dynamics AX Setup wizard to install the Retail Channel Configuration Utility. For more information, see [Install the Retail Channel Configuration Utility (Retail Store Database Utility)](install-the-retail-channel-configuration-utility-retail-store-database-utility.md).

The procedures in this topic assume that you have installed a supported version of Microsoft SQL Server on the computer where you plan to run the Retail Channel Configuration Utility. For a list of supported operating systems and SQL Server versions, see the [Microsoft Dynamics AX system requirements](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=165377). For information about how to configure SQL Server for channel databases and offline databases, see [Configure SQL Server for the Retail databases](configure-sql-server-for-the-retail-databases.md).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>For direct database connections to work, you must configure direct database connectivity and set the appropriate point of sale (POS) user permissions.</P>
> <P>Additionally, if you are changing a previously activated instance of Retail Modern POS so that it uses a direct database connection, you must restart dllhost.exe from Task Manager.</P>
