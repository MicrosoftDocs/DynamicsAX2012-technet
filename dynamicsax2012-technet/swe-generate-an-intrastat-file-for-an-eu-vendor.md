# (SWE) Generate an Intrastat file for an EU vendor 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The Intrastat declaration is the compulsory monthly declaration of movements of goods between European Union (EU) member states. Swedish companies can export Intrastat details for vendor transactions in a specific file format, and then submit the formatted file to Statistiska centralbyrÃ¥n (SCB) using the Intrastat Data Entry Package (IDEP).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can generate the Intrastat file only for the legal entities whose primary address is in Sweden.</P>



Before generating the Intrastat file, complete the following tasks:

  - Select the **Foreign trade** configuration key.

  - Set up Intrastat parameters to generate Intrastat transaction details and compression details.

  - Create an item, and then specify the **Commodity**, **Additional units**, and **Net weight** fields for the Intrastat transaction. For more information, see [Foreign trade parameters (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa620385\(v=ax.60\)), [Compression of Intrastat (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa584795\(v=ax.60\)), [Released product details (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa615563\(v=ax.60\)), and [Create items](create-items.md).
