# What's new: Call center features 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

We have added the call center as a new type of retail channel in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3. New call centers and call center catalogs are created in the **Retail** module. Many tasks that are related to the setup and management of a call center are performed in the new [Call center](call-center.md) module. For more information, see the following table.
