# Create a customer record 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can create a customer record by using either the **Create new customer** form or the **Setup** form. If you create a new customer record in the **Setup** form, you must identify the party record as a customer. For more information about how to create a customer record in the **Setup** form, see [Create a party record](create-a-party-record.md).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>To speed up the process of creating customer records, you can create templates that are based on the values in fields in customer records that you specify as template models. If a template is available when you create a new customer record, a form appears that displays the available customer templates. Select the template that applies to the new customer. The field values of the template are copied to the fields in the new customer record. You can change the fields and enter more information, as appropriate.</P>



1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Common** \> **Customers** \> **All customers**. On the **Action Pane**, on the **Customer account** tab, in the **Customer account** group, click **Customer account**.

    Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Common** \> **Customers** \> **All customers**. On the **Action Pane**, on the **Customer account** tab, in the **Customer account** group, click **Customer account**.

2.  In the **Customer** form, in the **Record type** field, select whether the customer is an organization or a person.

3.  If the customer already has a party record in the global address book, select the customer’s name. If the customer does not have an existing record, enter the customer’s name.

4.  Select the customer group and currency code that apply to the customer.

5.  Select the appropriate payment, delivery, and tax information for the customer.

6.  Select the country/region and the ZIP/postal code where the customer is located and enter any other address and contact information.

7.  Click **Customer account** to add more information to the customer record, or click **Customer account** to close the customer record. You can add more information to the record later.
    
    If you select to save the information that you entered and open the customer record to add more details, see [Customers (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa590606\(v=ax.60\)) for more information.

After you save the record, it is added to the global address book.
