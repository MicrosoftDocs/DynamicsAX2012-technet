# Bulk edit product attributes by using Excel (Retail essentials) 


This topic explains how to use Microsoft Excel to update attributes such as size, color, and dimensions for products that you sell in your retail stores.

In Retail essentials, you use product attributes to add merchandising details to the products that you offer in your store. Product attributes include things like color, size, product dimensions, and other product details.

You can edit product attributes at any time. You can edit them one by one, or you can bulk edit them by exporting them to Excel, editing them there, and then importing the changes back into Retail essentials. In Excel, you can edit all product attributes or you can edit only the product attributes that are assigned to a specific category.

**Using Excel in Retail essentials**

You can use Excel to bulk edit product attributes for products offered. In Retail essentials, bulk editing product attributes in Excel is even easier. Enhancements to functionality allow you to do the following:

  - Easily identify required attributes.

  - Enter URLs for images and videos directly in the spreadsheet and upload that data back to Retail essentials.

  - Select the appropriate value from a fixed list when multiple values are assigned to a specific attribute.

  - More easily assign an appropriate value to attributes that include a minimum and maximum value range. If minimum and maximum value ranges arenâ€™t defined for an attribute, the minimum and maximum value ranges that are defined for the system are used.
