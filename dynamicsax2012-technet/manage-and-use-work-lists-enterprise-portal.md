# Manage and use work lists (Enterprise Portal) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Work lists display Workflow work items, tasks, alerts, and activities that you can act on or must be notified about. Some items in the list, such as Workflow work items, may require that you perform some action. For example, you may have to approve the work item or delegate it to another employee. Other items, such as alerts, may give you helpful information about a predefined event, such as a shipping date or details about a sales order.

If a work list item is shown in bold type, you have not viewed or acted on the item. To view and act on a work list item, select the item in the list, and then right-click the item to open a menu of available commands.

The following table describes the commands that are available for most work list items.

<table>
