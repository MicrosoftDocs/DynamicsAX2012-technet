# (RUS) Specify an inventory profile in sales and purchase order lines when exploding a BOM 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

When you explode a bill of materials (BOM) on sales order lines or purchase order lines, the value of the **Inventory profile** field is specified on the order lines that correspond to the BOM lines:

  - If the **Inventory profile** field is not active for the specified item, the dimension value is not specified.

  - If the **Inventory profile** field is specified in an order header, the value of the **Inventory profile** field is specified on the order lines.

  - If the **Inventory profile** dimension is specified on a BOM line, the value of the **Inventory profile** dimension is specified on the order lines.

  - If the inventory profile parameter is specified in the **Bills of materials** area of the **Inventory and warehouse management parameters** form, the value of the **Inventory profile** dimension on the order lines is populated with the value that is set in the **Inventory and warehouse management parameters** form.
