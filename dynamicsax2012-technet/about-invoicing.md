# About invoicing 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The project type determines which invoicing procedure should be applied. Only the two external project types, time-and-material and fixed-price projects, can be invoiced. Time-and-material projects and fixed-price projects are always attached to a project contract.

  - Fixed-price projects – The customer invoice amount is based on invoice billing schedules. Invoicing is performed through an on-account setup, also referred to as a billing schedule. Fixed-price projects can be invoiced per project or per project contract.

  - Time-and-material projects – The customer invoice amount is based on transaction lines that are entered on projects. Transactions can be invoiced per project or per project contract.

Time-and-material projects and fixed-price projects can be attached to the invoice projects as follows:

  - On-account invoicing – Time-and-material projects and fixed-price projects can be invoiced on account. Two different types of on-account setups are required for the two project types.

  - Invoicing in the periodic section – Through the periodic functions, transactions can be invoiced across projects. The periodic functions provide an overview of transactions to be invoiced.

  - By using credit notes in invoicing – A credit note can be created for both time-and-material projects and fixed-price projects.
