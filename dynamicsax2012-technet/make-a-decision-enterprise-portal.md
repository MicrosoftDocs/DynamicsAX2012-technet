# Make a decision (Enterprise Portal) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A *decision* represents a point at which a workflow divides into two branches. To make a decision, you must select one of two choices. The choices are typically **Yes** or **No**, or **True** or **False**. The choice that you make will determine which workflow branch is used to process the submitted document.

1.  View the document that has the decision associated with it.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If your organization uses Role Centers, you can use the <STRONG>Work list</STRONG> Web part to view the decisions assigned to you. For more information, see <A href="view-your-work-items-enterprise-portal.md">View your work items (Enterprise Portal)</A>.</P>



2.  Review the workflow message bar for information about the decision. Click the icon on the message bar to view detailed instructions about the decision.

3.  A decision can be assigned to multiple people; however, only one person can make a decision. If this decision is assigned to multiple people, but you want to make it, click **Actions** \> **Accept**. This indicates that you will make the decision.

4.  Click **Actions** and then click one of the following options.
    
      - **\[Choice 1\]** – This is the decision that you want to make.
    
      - **\[Choice 2\]** – This is the decision that you want to make.
    
      - **Delegate** – Assign the decision to another user.
    
      - **View history** – View the workflow status and history of the document.
