# (FRA) About titres de recette (Public sector) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The titre de recette is used by the director to notify the accountant that the organization is entitled to collect a specific amount from another entity, and to authorize the accountant to collect that amount. The titre maintains the strict separation that is required between the operational role of the director and the accounting role of the accountant.

In Microsoft Dynamics AX, each titre is assigned a single free text invoice line. This guarantees that each titre concerns only one type of revenue and includes only one budgetary account.

A group of related titres, together with all supporting documentation, are assigned to a bordereau de titre for submittal to the accountant. The director must make sure that the bordereau de titre includes either operating revenue or capital revenue. It cannot include a mix.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> <P>A titre cannot be assigned a customer invoice that was entered through the payment journal.</P>
