# (RUS) Generate and print an Inventory act (INV-17) or Certificate (Appendix to INV-17) report for customers 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic has not been fully updated for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2.</P>



The inventory data is collected from the **Accounts receivable inventory act** register by using the **Counting act** form that is displayed in the **Account receivable counting lines** form under the following conditions:

  - If an approved register already exists on the inventory start date and the period of the approved register is after the period that includes the inventory start date, data from the register is displayed in the **Account receivable counting lines** form.

  - If non-approved registers exist on the inventory start date and the period of the register is after the period that includes the inventory start date, the registers will be recalculated.

  - If there is no approved journal on the inventory start date, a new journal will be created in the **Tax register journal** form and the registers will be calculated.

  - If there is no approved journal but the period of the existing non-approved journal is not after the inventory start date, then it is not possible to calculate the register. You must delete the existing tax register journal manually.

Before you create and generate the inventory act report, you must set up the debt intervals and set up the **Accounts receivable inventory act** register.
