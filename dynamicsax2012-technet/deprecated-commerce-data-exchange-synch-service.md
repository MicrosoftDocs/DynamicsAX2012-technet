# Deprecated: Commerce Data Exchange: Synch Service 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack and Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Commerce Data Exchange: Synch Service (Retail Store Connect) is the integrated service that periodically replicates data between the Microsoft Dynamics AX database and store databases.

Synch Service runs as a MicrosoftÂ Windows service, DBServer.exe, that listens for incoming requests or packages. If the service receives a read instruction, it connects to the source database, reads data, and stores the data in a data package file.
