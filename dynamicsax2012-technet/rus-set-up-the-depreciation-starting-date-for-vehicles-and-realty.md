1.  Click **Fixed assets (Russia)** \> **Setup** \> **Depreciation groups**.

2.  Create a depreciation group, and then enter the required details.

3.  Click the **General** tab.

4.  In the **Depreciation start date** field, select **Date of the registration** to specify the registration date for a fixed asset as the depreciation starting date.
