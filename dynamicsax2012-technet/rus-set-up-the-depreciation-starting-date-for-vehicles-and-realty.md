# (RUS) Set up the depreciation starting date for vehicles and realty 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use the **Depreciation groups** form to set up the depreciation starting date for fixed assets of type **Realty** or **Vehicle**. Depreciation is calculated based on the registration date for the asset. If an asset is registered after it is put to use, depreciation is calculated from the first day of the month of registration. If an asset is registered before it is put to use, depreciation is calculated from the first day of the month after the asset is put to use.

1.  Click **Fixed assets (Russia)** \> **Setup** \> **Depreciation groups**.

2.  Create a depreciation group, and then enter the required details.

3.  Click the **General** tab.

4.  In the **Depreciation start date** field, select **Date of the registration** to specify the registration date for a fixed asset as the depreciation starting date.
