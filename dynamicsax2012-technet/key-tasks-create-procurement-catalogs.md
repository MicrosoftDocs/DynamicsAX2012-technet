# Key tasks: Create procurement catalogs 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Create and maintain catalogs that company employees can use when they order items and services for internal use. To set up a catalog and make it available to employees, you must complete the following tasks:

  - Determine how you want users to navigate through the catalog on the procurement site.

  - Select the products that users can view and the vendors from whom users can order.

  - If users are permitted to order directly from a vendor, add access to external vendor catalog sites.

  - Activate and publish the catalog, and configure the catalog policy rule so that users can view the catalog on the procurement site.

  - Maintain the catalog by publishing changes to products or catalogs, and adding product images to the catalog.

## Configure the overall catalog settings

Use this procedure to create a new catalog and configure the settings that apply to the whole catalog.

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Common** \> **Catalogs** \> **Procurement catalogs**.

2.  On the **Procurement catalogs** list page, on the **Action Pane**, click **Catalog**.

3.  In the **Create catalog** dialog box, enter the catalog name, and then follow one of these steps:
    
      - If you want the navigation structure for your catalog to be created automatically, select the **Populate catalog using procurement category hierarchy:** check box. All products, attributes, and vendors that are assigned to the procurement categories are automatically added to the catalog.
    
      - If you want to create the navigation structure for your catalog manually, clear the **Populate catalog using procurement category hierarchy:** check box. You can then add products, attributes, and vendors to your catalog manually.

4.  In the **Catalogs** form, on the **Action Pane**, on the **Catalog** tab, click **Edit**.

5.  In the left pane, click the catalog's root node. Then, on the **Catalog settings** FastTab, follow these steps:
    
    1.  Enter a description for the catalog.
    
    2.  Select the default update type for the whole catalog. The following options are available:
        
          - **Static** – Manually control product updates to your catalog.
        
          - **Dynamic** – Automatically pass product updates from your product master to your procurement site.
        
          - **Both** – Set the default update type to either **Static** or **Dynamic** for individual categories.

6.  In the **Owner** field, select the catalog owner.

7.  Make sure that the **Catalog status** field is set to **Inactive**. The catalog should have a status of **Inactive** until you are ready to publish it.

8.  In the **Number of search results to display per page** field, enter the maximum number of search results that are displayed per page on the procurement site.

9.  On the **Price range** FastTab, add filters for price ranges. Users can then filter search results by price when they look for products in the catalog on the procurement site.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can also add price range filters for individual categories.</P>



10. On the **Presentations** FastTab, click **Edit**, and then enter the welcome text that you want to appear on the **Order products** site in Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX.

11. On the **Product relation types** FastTab, click **Add**, and then add the product relationships for the products in your catalog. Use the **Move up** and **Move down** buttons to set the order of precedence that is used when search results are displayed.

## Copy a catalog

Use this procedure to create a new catalog by copying an existing catalog. When you copy a catalog, all catalog categories and associated products are copied to the new catalog. You can then modify the new catalog to meet your requirements.

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Common** \> **Catalogs** \> **Procurement catalogs**.

2.  On the **Procurement catalogs** list page, select the catalog that you want to copy.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Catalog** tab, in the **New** group, click **Copy catalog**.

4.  After the new catalog is created, double-click the new catalog to open it. You can then make any changes that are required.

## Activate or inactivate a catalog

To make a catalog available on your procurement site, you must activate it and make sure that it is assigned to a catalog policy rule. You can also inactivate any catalogs that you no longer want to be available to your users.

For more information about how to set up catalog policy rules, see [Set up a procurement catalog policy rule](set-up-a-procurement-catalog-policy-rule.md).

### Activate a catalog

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Common** \> **Catalogs** \> **Procurement catalogs**.

2.  On the **Procurement catalogs** list page, select the catalog that you want to activate.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, in the **Publish** group, click **Activate catalog**.

### Inactivate a catalog

2.  On the **Procurement catalogs** list page, select the catalog that you want to inactivate.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, in the **Publish** group, click **Inactivate catalog**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>When a catalog is inactivated, pending transactions that are already in progress, and that include products from the catalog, are processed. Products from the inactivated catalog that are currently in the shopping cart are no longer valid, and the user is notified that the product is no longer available for order.</P>

## Preview and publish a catalog

When you create a catalog, you can preview it on the procurement site before you make it available to your employees. Only the catalog owner can preview the catalog.

To make the catalog available to your employees on the procurement site for the first time, you must publish the catalog. After the catalog has been published, any updates that are made to the catalog are published to the procurement site. The updates are published either automatically or manually, depending on the option that is selected for the catalog in the **Default update type** field in the **Catalogs** form. The following default update types are available for catalogs:

  - **Dynamic** – Catalogs are automatically updated whenever a change is made to the catalog.

  - **Static** – Catalogs must be manually updated.

  - **Both** – Catalogs that include product categories that have a default update type of **Static** must be manually updated when these categories are updated. Catalogs that include product categories that have a default update type of **Dynamic** are automatically updated whenever a change is made to the catalog.

Use these procedures to preview your catalog on the procurement site, and to manually update catalogs that have a default update type of **Static**.

### Preview a catalog

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Common** \> **Catalogs** \> **Procurement catalogs**.

2.  On the **Procurement catalogs** list page, select the catalog that you want to preview.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, in the **Publish** group, click **Preview catalog**.

The catalog opens in the Employee services portal in Enterprise Portal.

### Publish or update a catalog

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Common** \> **Catalogs** \> **Procurement catalogs**.

2.  On the **Procurement catalogs** list page, double-click the catalog that you want to publish or update.

3.  In the **Catalogs** form, update products, vendors, external catalog links, and other options as necessary.

4.  If your catalog has a status of **Inactive**, on the **Action Pane**, in the **Publish** group, click **Activate catalog**.

5.  On the **Action Pane**, in the **Publish** group, click **Publish catalog**.

View your catalog, and verify the catalog data in the Employee services portal in Enterprise Portal.
