# Delete requests for quotation 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can delete requests for quotation (RFQs) and RFQ replies from Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3. The corresponding RFQ journals are not deleted, but remain as a record in the system.

## Delete a request for quotation

Use this procedure to delete a single request for quotation. You can do this only if you have not sent the RFQ yet. The highest status on all lines in the RFQ must be **Created**.

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Common** \> **Requests for quotations** \> **All requests for quotations**.

2.  Open the RFQ that you want to delete.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, click **Delete**.

## Delete a group of requests for quotation

Use this procedure to clean up AX 2012 R3 by deleting old RFQs and the corresponding replies that you no longer need.

1.  Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Periodic** \> **Clean up** \> **Delete requests for quotations**.

2.  Click the **Batch** tab.

3.  Set the criteria for which RFQs to delete. For example, this can be all RFQs created before a specific date, or all RFQs that expired on a specific date/time.
