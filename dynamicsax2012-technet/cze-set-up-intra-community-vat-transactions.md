# (CZE) Set up intra-community VAT transactions 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

When you purchase products from countries/regions in the European Union, the payable value-added tax (VAT) must be paid to the tax authority in the VAT period that includes the document date. The document date is the date on which the sales invoice is issued. You can deduct the receivable VAT only after the products are received and the corresponding receipt document is posted.

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Setup** \> **Accounts payable parameters**.

2.  In the left pane, click **Ledger and sales tax**, and then, on the **Sales tax** FastTab, select the **Intra-community VAT** check box to enable intra-community sales tax.

3.  Select the **Document date for intra-community VAT** check box to use the document date as the registration date of the VAT transaction.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>When a purchase invoice is posted, the receivable VAT and payable VAT are posted at the same time. Receivable VAT is posted on the invoice document date. Payable VAT is posted on the VAT register date of the invoice.</P>
