You can also add, modify, or delete invoice charge transaction lines.

You can also set up and calculate charges for an intercompany transaction.

You must set up a charge code with the category set to **Intercompany percent**. When you create an intercompany purchase order or sales order, the charges code defined for the customer or vendor and item combination is used to calculate charges.

A sales order or purchase order is created automatically for the intercompany for the original purchase order or sales order when the charges category is set to **Intercompany percent**. The charges are added to both the original order and the automatically created order to match the invoice amounts.
