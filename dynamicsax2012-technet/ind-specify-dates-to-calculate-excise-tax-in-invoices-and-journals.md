      - **Delivery date** – For a purchase invoice, calculate the excise tax based on the date when the product receipt is posted. In journals, calculate the excise tax based on the date when the invoice is posted.
    
      - **Document date** – For a purchase invoice, calculate the excise tax based on the document date for the product receipt. For journal transactions, calculate the excise tax based on the document date that is entered on the **Invoice** tab in the **Journal voucher** form.
    
      - **Invoice date** – For both purchase invoices and journals, calculate the excise tax based on the date when the invoice is posted.
