# Create or update a vendor status change request 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use a vendor status change request to request a change to a vendor's hold status. A vendor's hold status determines whether purchase orders can be created for the vendor, whether the vendor invoice can be paid, and so on.

## Create a vendor status change request

1.  Click **Order products** on the top link bar, and then click **Vendor requests** on the Quick Launch.

2.  On the **Vendor requests** page, click **Vendor status**.

3.  On the **Vendor status change request** page, select your name in the **Requester** field, and then select the vendor account number in the **Vendor account** field.

4.  In the **Requested status** field, select the appropriate status. The following values are available:
    
      - **No** – No transaction types are on hold for this vendor. All types of transactions are permitted.
    
      - **Invoice** – No invoices can be created or posted for this vendor.
    
      - **All** – All transactions for this vendor are on hold.
    
      - **Payment** – No payments can be generated for this vendor. Payments that were generated before the hold was applied can be posted.
    
      - **Requisition** – No requisitions that reference this vendor can be created.
    
      - **Never** – No transaction types are on hold for this vendor, and the vendor cannot automatically be put on hold because of inactivity. This status is used for vendors who are used regularly but rarely. For example, you can use the **Never** hold status for a vendor that performs some kind of annual maintenance.
