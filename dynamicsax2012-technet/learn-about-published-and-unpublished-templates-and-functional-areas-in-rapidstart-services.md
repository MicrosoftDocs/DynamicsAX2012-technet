# Learn about published and unpublished templates and functional areas in RapidStart Services 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Beginning October 1, 2015, RapidStart services will no longer be supported. For more information, see the announcement on CustomerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/partnersource/northamerica/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued or PartnerSourcehttps://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/news-events/news-events/news/RapidStartServicesDiscontinued.

In Microsoft Dynamics ERP RapidStart Services, business experts answer questions about their business operations. The answers that they provide are used to configure an implementation of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 for an organization. These questions can be grouped together in question groups, and multiple question groups can be assigned to a functional area. Multiple functional areas can then be grouped together in templates, which are used as the basis for a configuration project in RapidStart Services.

Templates and functional areas in RapidStart Services can exist in two states: unpublished and published.

## Templates

When you first create a template, it is in an unpublished state. When a template is in this state, you can add functional areas to it and modify its metadata. If you want to modify a template that has been published, you must first unpublish it. When you unpublish a template, a message displays a list of projects that use the template.

When you publish a template, RapidStart Services verifies that the template includes at least one published functional area. The functional area must contain at least one question group that has at least one question. Other validation checks are also performed.

Only published templates can be added to configuration projects. Unpublished templates are not displayed in the list of templates that you can select for a configuration project.

## Functional areas

When you first create a functional area, it is in an unpublished state. When a functional area is in this state, you can add question groups to it and modify its metadata. If you want to modify a functional area that has been published, you must first unpublish it.

When you publish a functional area, RapidStart Services verifies that the functional area includes at least one question group that has at least one question. You cannot publish a functional area that does not include at least one question.
