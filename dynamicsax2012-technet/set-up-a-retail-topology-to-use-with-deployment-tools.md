# Set up a Retail topology to use with deployment tools 


Before you can use deployment tools to mass deploy retail components, you must enter information about the topology of the retail environment in Microsoft Dynamics AX. You’ll also specify settings for each component that will be deployed.

> [!NOTE]
> <P>The information in this topic applies only to Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3.</P>

This topic contains the following sections:

  - Step 1: Import or enter computer information in Microsoft Dynamics AX

  - Step 2: Set up a deployment plan in Microsoft Dynamics AX

  - Step 3: Export the retail deployment plan from Microsoft Dynamics AX

## Step 1: Import or enter computer information in Microsoft Dynamics AX

First, specify the computers to include in the deployment. You can use two methods to create the list of computers in Microsoft Dynamics AX. We recommend that you bulk import computer entities from Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager. If Configuration Manager isn’t available, you can manually enter information about individual computers in Microsoft Dynamics AX.

> [!NOTE]
> <P>Computer entities that you define in Microsoft Dynamics AX must already be discovered in Configuration Manager before you import the topology to Configuration Manager.</P>

## Bulk import computer entities from Configuration Manager (recommended)

If your environment includes System Center Configuration Manager, you can use the following procedure to import computer information into Microsoft Dynamics AX. Office Add-ins for Microsoft Dynamics AX, the Retail mass deployment toolkit, and the Configuration Manager console must be installed to complete this procedure.

For information about how to install the toolkit, see [Install the Retail mass deployment toolkit](install-the-retail-mass-deployment-toolkit.md). For information about how to install Office Add-ins, see [Install Office Add-ins](install-office-add-ins.md).

1.  Open a Command Prompt window, and change the directory to the folder where RetailConfigMgrToolkit.exe is located. By default, the file is located at \<Drive\>:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Dynamics AX\\60\\Retail Scaleout Deployment\\ConfigManagerToolKit.

2.  Run the following command to export discovered computers to a CSV file:
    
    **RetailConfigMgrToolkit.exe -o ExportMachines -f \<file name.csv\>**
    
    All computers discovered by Configuration Manager are exported to the CSV file.

3.  Open the Microsoft Dynamics AX client.

4.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Retail mass-deployment** \> **Target computers** \> **Computers**.

5.  On the ribbon, click **Export to Microsoft Excel**. A new Microsoft Excel document opens, in which the column names correspond to the fields in the form.

6.  In Excel, open the CSV file that you created earlier.

7.  Copy the records from the CSV file, and paste them into the Excel file.

8.  In Excel, on the ribbon, on the **Dynamics AX** tab, click **Publish** to publish the new records to Microsoft Dynamics AX. Computer records are created in the **Computers** form.

## Define security credentials

To set up and secure communication among the various Retail components, you must provide credentials and obtain certificates. During deployment, you need a way to provide this information without allowing too many people access to it. You can do this by saving credentials and certificate information in a clear-text xml file that is stored on a secure file share at headquarters. This type of file is called a security file. By allowing only deployment tools and a limited number of users access to security files, you help make your credentials and certificates more secure.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The deployment tools for Retail components support security files starting in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 Cumulative Update 8.</P>



A security file is required when you use mass deployment tools to deploy the following components.

<table>

<col style="width: 33%" />

</tbody>
</table>


For information about how to create and connect to a security file, see: [Create a security file for Retail deployment](create-a-security-file-for-retail-deployment.md).

## Optional. Manually enter log and computer information in Microsoft Dynamics AX

Use the following procedure to enter individual computer records in Microsoft Dynamics AX.

1.      

> [!NOTE]
> <P>This step is only available on AX 2012 R3 CU8.</P>

Under **Retail Mass-deployment** \> **Security** \> **Retail deployment log shares**, enter a location to store log files.

2.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Retail mass-deployment** \> **Target computers** \> **Computers**.

3.  Click **Retail computer** to add a new record.

4.  Enter a unique name to identify the computer record in Microsoft Dynamics AX.

5.  Enter identifying information about the computer, such as the computer name, and the domain or workgroup that the computer belongs to.
    
    If you are creating a topology for AX 2012 R3 CU8 and have defined a log share, you can also select it for each **Retail computer**.

## Set up retail computer clusters

Create one or more clusters of retail computers. Each cluster can contain one or more computers. You use a cluster to deploy a component to a group of servers for load balancing.

Clusters are used only to deploy components to web servers.

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Retail mass-deployment** \> **Target computers** \> **Retail computer clusters**.

2.  Enter a name and description for the cluster.

3.  Add retail computers to the cluster.

## Step 2: Set up a deployment plan in Microsoft Dynamics AX

After you have identified the computers to include in the deployment, you must specify the deployment settings for each Retail component that you want to deploy.


> [!TIP]
> <p>Avoid the use of spaces in configuration parameters when completing forms.</p>

## Create a deployment profile for a channel database

Define a deployment profile for each channel database that you plan to deploy.

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Retail mass-deployment** \> **Deployable components** \> **Channel database deployment**.

2.  Enter a name and description for the profile.

3.  Enter or select the following information.

## Step 3: Export the retail deployment plan from Microsoft Dynamics AX

After computers and deployment information have been defined in Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can export the deployment plan by using the Retail mass deployment toolkit.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>To run the ExportRetailTopology command, the toolkit must be able to connect to Microsoft Dynamics AX via .NET Business Connector, regardless of whether the Application Object Server (AOS) is locally or remotely installed.</P>



1.  Open a Command Prompt window, and change the directory to the folder where RetailConfigMgrToolkit.exe is located. By default, the file is located at \<Drive\>:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Dynamics AX\\60\\Retail Scaleout Deployment\\ConfigManagerToolKit.

2.  Run the following command to export the topology that you defined to an XML file:
    
    **RetailConfigMgrToolkit.exe -o ExportRetailTopology -f \<file name.xml\>**

3.  Import the topology XML file into the deployment tool that you’re using. For more information, see [Mass deploy Retail components by using System Center Configuration Manager](mass-deploy-retail-components-by-using-system-center-configuration-manager.md) or [Set up a self-service Retail deployment](set-up-a-self-service-retail-deployment.md).

## Use the Retail deployment visualizer to work with a graphical view of the topology

Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Retail mass-deployment** \> **Retail deployment visualizer**.

The retail deployment visualizer shows the deployment profiles that have been set up for each retail component.

The retail topology is arranged in a hierarchy, with the organization at the top, and a branch for each type of retail component. To list the deployment profiles that have been set up for each component, click a component node and then click the **Search** button in the right pane. To add a new deployment profile, select the related component node and then click **Insert** \> **(Component)**. The deployment profile form for that component opens.
