## Install retail components in AX 2012 R2 and AX 2012 Feature Pack

To use the retail components in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, you must select the **Extensions** model file when you install the Microsoft Dynamics AX database. For more information about how to install model files, see [Install the Microsoft Dynamics AX databases](install-the-microsoft-dynamics-ax-databases.md).

In AX 2012 R2 and AX 2012 Feature Pack, the available components differ from AX 2012 R3. Most importantly, you must install Synch Service instead of installing Async Client and Async Server.
