# (IND) About EPCG incentive schemes for export orders 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

When you create a new sales order to export products that meet the requirements for the Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) incentive scheme, you can assign an EPCG incentive scheme to the sales order.

Before you can create an export sales order for an EPCG incentive scheme, you must complete the following tasks:

  - Enable customs and EXIM incentive schemes. For more information, see [(IND) Enable customs and EXIM incentive schemes](ind-enable-customs-and-exim-incentive-schemes.md).

  - Set up customs and excise tax parameters. For more information, see [(IND) Setting up customs parameters](ind-setting-up-customs-parameters.md).

  - Set up parameters for EPCG schemes. For more information, see [(IND) Set up general ledger parameters for the EPCG incentive scheme](ind-set-up-general-ledger-parameters-for-the-epcg-incentive-scheme.md).

  - Define currency exchange rates to use for export transactions. For more information, see [Currency exchange rates (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh209477\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Set up an EPCG incentive scheme for the primary license. For more information, see [(IND) Create a primary EPCG license](ind-create-a-primary-epcg-license.md).

  - If you export technology products, set up a technology upgrade EPCG license. For information about how to set up a technology upgrade EPCG license, see [(IND) Create an EXIM EPCG scheme for a technology upgrade EPCG license](ind-create-an-exim-epcg-scheme-for-a-technology-upgrade-epcg-license.md).
