# (IND) Merge EPCG licenses 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can merge two or more Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) licenses into a single license. After you merge the licenses in Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can apply to the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) for approval to merge the licenses.

In Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can merge EPCG licenses only if the following conditions are true:

  - The issue dates of the selected licenses fall within the same fiscal period.

  - The status of all the selected licenses is **Approved**.

  - The port ID is the same for all the selected licenses.

  - The status of the selected licenses is either **Original** or **Domestic**. You cannot merge a combination of original and domestic licenses.
