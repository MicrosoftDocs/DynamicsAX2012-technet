_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

If a customer has an overdue balance, your organization might generate and send a collection letter to the customer to help collect on the account. You can use the **Collection letters** page to view a list of collection letters that have been generated, and then use the **View collection letter** page to view the details and transaction lines for a specific collection letter entry. You can also export collection letter data to Microsoft Excel.

1.  Click **Sales** on the top link bar, and then click **Customers** on the Quick Launch.

2.  Select a customer account for which collection letters have been created.

3.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Sell** tab, click **Collection letters**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If the <STRONG>Block</STRONG> check box is selected on the <STRONG>Collection letters</STRONG> page, the customer cannot be issued any additional invoices until the past-due amounts have been collected. You can change this field in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client.</P>



4.  To view the details of a collection letter entry, select a letter. On the **Action Pane**, on the **Collection letter** tab, click **Collection letter**. On the **View collection letter** page, you can view information about the collection letter entry and the transaction details.
