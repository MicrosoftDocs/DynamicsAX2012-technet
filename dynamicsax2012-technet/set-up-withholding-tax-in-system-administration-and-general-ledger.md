_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Withholding tax is a tax on vendors that does not create sales tax transactions. Withholding tax that is calculated on vendor payments is a liability. Therefore, only balance sheet accounts or liability accounts are valid accounts for posting withholding tax.

Withholding tax is reported in fixed reports.

1.  Click **System administration** \> **Setup** \> **Licensing** \> **License configuration**.

2.  Expand the **General ledger** node and select the **Withholding tax** check box.

3.  Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **Withholding tax** \> **Withholding tax codes**.

4.  Create withholding tax codes with values and limits.

5.  Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **Withholding tax** \> **Withholding tax groups**.

6.  Create withholding tax groups and add the relevant withholding tax codes on the **Setup** tab.
