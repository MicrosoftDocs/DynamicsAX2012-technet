# Create disposition codes 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic applies to features in the <STRONG>Warehouse management</STRONG> module. It does not apply to features in the <A href="inventory-management.md">Inventory management</A> module.</P>



This topic explains how to create disposition codes for the inbound receiving process. Disposition codes are a collection of rules that are used when damaged items are received. For example, when a work user uses a mobile device to receive items that were damaged, the user must scan a disposition code for damaged items. Microsoft Dynamics AX uses the disposition codes to generate an inventory status and a work template, and then searches for the location directive with the same disposition code to determine where to put away the returned items.

1.  Click **Warehouse management** \> **Setup** \> **Mobile device** \> **Disposition codes**.

2.  Click **New** to create a disposition code.

3.  In the **Inventory status** field, select the inventory status of the received items.

4.  In the **Work template code** field, select a work template code that is associated with a work order type, return order, or purchase order. You assign a work template to a disposition code only when you want to override the work template.

5.  In the **Return disposition code** field, select a return disposition code for a sales return order.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>After you select a <STRONG>Return disposition code</STRONG>, the disposition code is applicable only for the sales order return process.</P>
