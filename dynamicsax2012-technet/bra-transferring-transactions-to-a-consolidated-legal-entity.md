# (BRA) Transferring transactions to a consolidated legal entity 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can transfer all of the transactions from a selected subsidiary legal entity to a consolidated legal entity. When you transfer the transactions to the consolidated legal entity, the original transaction details, such as the default description, voucher number, transaction type, transaction date, and currency, are also transferred. You can also do the following:

  - Export or import the transactions as a .txt file by using the **Consolidate** form.

  - Verify the original legal entity and voucher information after consolidation by using the **Account number %1** form.
