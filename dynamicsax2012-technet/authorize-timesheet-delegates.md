      - Otherwise: **Home** \> **Common** \> **Timesheets** \>**All timesheets**.

2.  On the **Action Pane**, on the **Timesheets** tab, in the **Maintain** group, click **My delegates**.

3.  In the **My delegates** form, click **New** to add a new line.

4.  In the **Delegate** field, select the person whom you want to authorize as a delegate.

5.  In the **Start date** and **End date** fields, select the dates for the period in which the delegate is authorized to enter time on your behalf.

### Set up delegates for multiple workers

1.  Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Setup** \> **Timesheets** \> **Delegates**.

2.  In the **Delegate setup** form, click **New** to add a new line.

3.  In the **Worker** field, select the worker for whom you want to assign a delegate.

4.  In the **Delegate** field, select a delegate to work on behalf of the worker whom you selected in the **Worker** field

5.  In the **Start date** and **End date** fields, select the dates for the period in which the delegate is authorized to enter time for the worker.
