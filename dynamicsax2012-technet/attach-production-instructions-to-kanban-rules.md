# Attach production instructions to kanban rules 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use this procedure to attach production instructions to kanban rules that are configured to use the **Manufacturing** type and the **Fixed** replenishment strategy. When you attach production instructions to a kanban rule, the production instructions for a kanban job are displayed in the **Kanban board for process jobs** form. You can also display the production instructions on kanban cards that you print.

The following conditions must be set up before you can complete the procedure:

  - The type of document that is used for production instructions is specified in the **Production control parameters** form. Click **Production control** \> **Setup** \> **Production control parameters**. Click **Lean manufacturing**. In the **Production instruction** field, select **File**.

  - The document that contains the production instructions must be saved to a location on the hard disk drive of a computer that can be accessed. The document formats that are supported include .txt, .jpeg, and .gif. Because high-resolution graphics can adversely affect the printing performance, we recommend that you use the minimum resolution that is needed for the document.

  - The kanban rule must be configured to print the production instructions. Click **Production control** \> **Setup** \> **Lean manufacturing** \> **Kanban rules**. On the **Kanban and cards** FastTab, in the **Print instructions** field, select **Work instructions**.
