## Communicate with an applicant

When communicating with applicants, companies typically send the applicant either a hard copy document or an email message.

Companies typically receive many responses to job advertisements, which can make the task of corresponding with each applicant a burden. To avoid this, you can use the **Create application document** and **E-mail applicant** features to automatically prepare letters and emails for applicants. Both types of communications are stored in the **Document management** folder. For more information, see [Document management in sales and marketing](document-management-in-sales-and-marketing.md). Before you can use these features, you must complete the following prerequisite tasks:

  - [Set up application bookmarks](set-up-application-bookmarks.md)

  - [Create document types for applicant communication](create-document-types-for-applicant-communication.md)

  - [Create a document template and associate it with a document type](create-a-document-template-and-associate-it-with-a-document-type.md)

  - [Create application email templates](create-application-email-templates.md)
