# Set up an online store 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

This topic explains how to set up an online store, which is a type of retail channel that customers can access on the web. An online store gives a retailer an online presence so that their customers can purchase products from their online store in addition to their brick-and-mortar store. Customers who purchase products from the online store can have the products shipped to them, or they can pick up the products from a local store.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic has been updated to include information about features that were added or changed for <STRONG>Retail</STRONG> in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3.</P>



The process of setting up an online store includes the following overall tasks:

1.  Create the online store.

2.  Add the store to the appropriate organization hierarchies.

3.  Configure the store details.

4.  Publish the store to a Microsoft SharePoint site.

After you publish the store, you can create retail product catalogs that you can publish to the store. The retail product catalogs contain the products that you offer through the online store. For information about how to create retail product catalogs, see [Key tasks: Create retail product catalogs](key-tasks-create-retail-product-catalogs.md).

## Prerequisites

You create an online store in Microsoft Dynamics AX and then publish it to a SharePoint site. Before you can publish an online store, you must do the following:

  - In AX 2012 R2 and AX 2012 Feature Pack, set up a distribution location for the online store. For more information, see [Create distribution locations for retail databases](create-distribution-locations-for-retail-databases.md).

  - In AX 2012 R3, set up a channel database profile instead of a distribution location. The channel database profile sets up the links between the online store in Microsoft Dynamics AX and the database that you use to publish the online store. For more information about how to set up a channel database profile, see [Set up a channel database profile](set-up-a-channel-database-profile.md).

  - Configure the appropriate publishing and product catalog site collections for the SharePoint site. For information about how to configure the site collections for a SharePoint site, see [Deploy a Microsoft Dynamics AX online store](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=263679).

## Create an online store

Use this procedure to create the basic structure for the online store. The details that you define for the online store in Microsoft Dynamics AX control the behavior of the online store after it is published. For more information, see [About online stores](about-online-stores.md).

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Common** \> **Retail channels** \> **Online stores**. On the **Online stores** list page, on the **Action Pane**, on the **Channel** tab, click **Online store**.

2.  In the **Online store** form, on the **General** FastTab, enter information in the following fields:
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />

    </table>


3.  On the **Payment accounts** FastTab, in the **Connectors** field, select the payment connector that is used to connect to the payment provider. Then enter the configuration data to enable payment processing for transactions that are received through the online store.

4.  On the **Languages** FastTab, click **Add** to add the languages that can be displayed in the online store. Select the **Default** check box to specify the language that appears by default.

## Assign an online store to an organization hierarchy

Before you can assign product assortments, fulfill orders for the online store that you created, or generate reports that include information from it, you must assign the store to one or more organization hierarchies. At a minimum, you must assign the online store to an organization hierarchy that includes product assortments. For more information about how to create and modify organization hierarchies, see [Create or modify an organization hierarchy](create-or-modify-an-organization-hierarchy.md).

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Organization** \> **Organization hierarchies**.

2.  In the **Organization hierarchies** form, select the hierarchy to add the online store to, and then click **View**.

3.  In the **Hierarchy designer -** form, on the **Action Pane**, click **Edit**.

4.  Click **Insert**, and then click **Retail channel**. In the **Retail channel** form, select an organization to add the online store to, and then click **OK**.

5.  After you finish making changes, follow one of these steps:
    
      - To save a draft, on the **Action Pane**, click **Save as draft**. Your changes are saved, but the hierarchy does not become active.
    
      - If you have finished making changes to the hierarchy, click **Publish and close**. When you publish a hierarchy, you must specify an effective date. The effective date indicates when the hierarchy becomes active.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If you close the <STRONG>Hierarchy designer -</STRONG> form without saving changes, a message appears asking you to save the hierarchy as a draft or discard your changes. If you close the message without making a selection, your changes are discarded.</P>



6.  Repeat steps 2 through 5 to add the online store to additional organization hierarchies.

## Configure an online store

After you set up the basic information for an online store and add it to the appropriate organization hierarchies, you can add more configuration data for the store, such as assortments, delivery modes, and attributes. Then, publish the online store to create the basic store structure for the SharePoint site. After the online store is published, you can assign product catalogs to it and publish your retail products to the online store to make the products available to your customers.

Depending on the version of AX 2012 you’re using, use one of the following procedures to configure an online store.

## Configure an online store in AX 2012 R2 and AX 2012 Feature Pack

To configure an online store in AX 2012 R2 and AX 2012 Feature Pack, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Common** \> **Retail channels** \> **Online stores**. In the **Online stores** list, double-click a store.

2.  In the **Online store** form, on the **Action Pane**, on the **Channel** tab, in the **Inventory** group, click **View assortments**.

3.  In the **View assortments** list, double-click an assortment. Alternatively, on the **Action Pane**, in the **New** group, click **Assortment** to add a new assortment.

4.  In the **Assortments** form, on the **Retail channels** FastTab, add the online store. If you are adding a new assortment, enter any additional details for the assortment. When you are finished, close the form.

5.  In the **Online store** form, on the **Action Pane**, on the **Channel** tab, in the **Pricing** group, click **Price groups**.

In the **Map attributes** form, for each category in the online store, select the options that indicate how the attributes for each category or channel product should behave in the online store on the SharePoint site.
