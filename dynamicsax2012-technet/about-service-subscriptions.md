# About service subscriptions 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Subscriptions are based on a time-and-materials project. You can create subscriptions from a project, from the **Service subscriptions** form, or by using a service subscription group.

For each subscription, you can create an optional number of subscription fees. The subscription fees are the transactions that you invoice to the customer.

A period code indicates the extent of the subscription fee period, or the intervals at which the subscription should be invoiced.

The period code is defined in the service subscription group. It is defined for the subscriptions through the service subscription group. Any new subscription fee that you create has a suggested start date. This is the start date of the period, if it is the first period that is created, or the end of the previous period, if it is the second or later period.
