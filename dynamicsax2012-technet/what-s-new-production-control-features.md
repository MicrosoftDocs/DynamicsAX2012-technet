<td><p>A new option for automating material reservations has been added to the <strong>Reservation</strong> field in the <strong>Production orders</strong> form, where the value is set for a specific production order. A new option has also been added to the <strong>Production control parameters</strong> form, where the default value is specified.</p>
<p>If you select <strong>Release</strong>, all materials are reserved when the production order is released.</p>
<p>If you use production processes in the <strong>Warehouse management</strong> module, some new options are available. A <strong>Release to warehouse</strong> field has been added to certain production forms, and contains the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Require full reservation</strong> – Select this option if you want to create wave lines and picking work only if all of the materials that are required by a production order can be reserved when the order is released. If all materials are not available, wave lines and work are not created. However, the status of the production will change to <strong>Released</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Allow partial reservation</strong> – Select this option if you want to create wave lines even though some of the materials that are required by a production order are not available when the order is released. If the materials become available later, you can release the order again by using the new <strong>Release to warehouse</strong> button.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A new <strong>Release to warehouse</strong> button has been added to the <strong>Production orders</strong> form. This button will create a wave line for any reserved quantity on the bill of materials lines that is not already associated with a wave line. This button is used when the production order has a status of <strong>Released</strong>, and you must release additional materials to the warehouse.</p></td>

<p>(Lean manufacturing)</p></td>
<td><p>The material date calculation is based on the actual job schedule. When a job is sequenced in the schedule, the material date and time are recalculated based on the expected receipt date and time of the job. In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, the material date and time was always set to the start of the period, which caused dependent jobs to exceed their due date.</p>

<td><p>You can now combine event kanbans together with CTP. The ability to move firmed orders based on CTP is limited to event kanbans, and occurs only when sales order lines are created. Further application of moving orders requires additional supply policies to ensure that planning is accurate.</p>
<p>To support forward scheduling of kanban jobs based on futures dates, you can move planned kanban jobs to later periods. This capability is also useful in the kanban scheduling board, where the new <strong>Schedule from date</strong> function has been added. When you schedule jobs for a futures date, the jobs are added at the end of the planning period, and planned according to the capacity that is available on the date. As opposed to automatic planning, the schedule from date function enables you to schedule jobs past the planning fence that is defined in the production flow model.</p>

<td><p><strong>Reverse empty kanbans</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>You can reverse the status of a handling unit that is assigned to a kanban, from <strong>Empty</strong> to <strong>Received</strong>. This may be necessary if a user erroneously registers the status as <strong>Empty</strong>. When you reverse the status of the handling unit, the following conditions apply:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The status of the handling unit changes from <strong>Empty</strong> to <strong>Received</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The transactions for consumption from kanban supermarkets are reversed.</p></li>
<li><p>For kanbans that are generated for a fixed-quantity kanban rule, the invalid kanban that was generated may be deleted.</p></li>
<li><p>If circulating cards are used, the connection between the kanban and a kanban card is reestablished.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Flush material on any activity</strong></p>
<p>For production flows that consist of multiple process activities, you can assign picking activities for specific item and product dimensions to any of the activities. This also applies to activities that consume semi finished products. When kanbans are created, the Kanban board for process jobs displays the picking lines for each job, and material consumption is registered against the corresponding job. Forward-flushed material is registered when a job is prepared. Back-flushed material is registered when a job is completed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This feature changes the way that picking lines for kanbans that span over multiple activities are saved to the database. In Microsoft Dynamics AX, picking lines for kanbans are associated with the first activity, regardless of the flushing principle of the item on the BOM (bill of materials) line. In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, picking lines that have the finish flushing principle are associated with the last activity of the kanban by default.</p>
<p>A migration script upgrades active kanbans that have multiple activities to the new model.</p></td>

<td><p>New operations resource model for planning operations and managing work center capabilities</p>
<p>Scheduling</p></td>
<td><p>The way that resources are grouped for the purpose of managing capacity has been separated from the way resource requirements are specified for manufacturing activities.</p>
<p>This separation enables resources to be used at multiple locations, and it removes the need to define resources multiple times, depending on how they are used or what they are used for. In addition, available capacity can be viewed by resource capability, which simplifies manual scheduling and exception handling.</p>
<p>As a result, the Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009 manufacturing “work center” concept has been redefined and is now called “resource.”</p>
<p>Because the way production capacity is managed is now separate from the way manufacturing requirements are specified, you can do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use the same equipment at multiple locations. For example, you can move equipment and operators to different production locations, as needed, thereby sharing production equipment and production operators across sites.</p></li>
<li><p>More easily reschedule an operation and find a suitable replacement resource that can complete the required operation, thereby minimizing production delays.</p></li>
<li><p>Define capabilities to an operation resource (previously known as a work center) and match any requirements of an operation with the capabilities of any particular resource, thereby facilitating the identification of available production resources.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More detailed information about the Operations Resource Model can be found in the white paper titled <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=213134%26clcid=0x409">Implementing the Operations Resource Model for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 applications</a>.</p></td>

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, resources can be allocated to jobs and operations by matching the capabilities of the resources with the requirements of the operation.</p>
<p>In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, alternative resources with the same capabilities are taken into consideration. This applies, regardless of whether you run job scheduling or operations scheduling. The selection process is the same, and consists of matching the requirements of the operation with the capabilities of the resources. Other constraints, such as location, resource working time, and resource type, are also considered when the production is planned.</p>
<p>As a result, task groups have become obsolete in Microsoft Dynamics AX 20122, and they have been removed.</p>
