# Transfer absence journals for approval 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Absence journals contain absence registrations for a specific worker for a specific period of time. When all absence registrations have been created for a worker for the current absence period, you can transfer that absence journal for that absence period to be approved. You can transfer your own absence journal for approval, or if you are an absence administrator, you can transfer another worker’s absence journal for approval. The absence administrator is the person in charge of the absence setup that is associated with a worker.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Before you can transfer an absence journal for approval, you must specify absence information for a worker and create absence journals for the worker. For more information, see <A href="specify-absence-information-for-a-worker.md">Specify absence information for a worker</A> and <A href="create-absence-journals.md">Create absence journals</A>.</P>



## Transfer your own absence journal

1.  Click **Home** \> **Common** \> **Absences** \> **Register absences**.

2.  Verify that all your absence registrations have been created for the current period and then click **Transfer**.

## Transfer another worker’s absence journal

1.  Click **Home** \> **Common** \> **Absences** \> **Register absences for multiple workers**.

2.  Select the worker to transfer an absence journal for.

3.  Verify that all of the worker’s absence registrations are listed on the **Absence registration details** FastTab and then click **Transfer**.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Even if there were no absences during the absence period, you still need to transfer absence journals for approval.</P>
