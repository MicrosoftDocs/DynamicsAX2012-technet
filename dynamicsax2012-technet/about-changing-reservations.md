# About changing reservations 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can change reservations on sales orders. For example, you may have to cancel reservations in the following situations:

  - The priority of existing reservations must be changed. For example, if an important customer places a large order with your company and requests immediate delivery, you may have to cancel some reservations to deliver to that customer.

  - Deliveries are unfulfilled or canceled, and the on-hand inventory must be shared among the customers who are waiting for items.

  - Items were not reserved when the sales order was created, because the person who created the sales order planned to manually reserve items later.
