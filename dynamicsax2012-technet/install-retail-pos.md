# Install Retail POS 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

Retail POS is a component that is required for the day-to-day operation of Retail at a store. When you install the Retail POS component, the Retail Salt Utility is also installed. The Retail Salt Utility provides extra encryption for the passwords and credentials that are associated with the Retail system.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Retail components are available with Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, AX 2012 R2, and AX 2012 Feature Pack.</P>



At the store, install this component on each register computer. If you plan to use a stand-alone database server at the store, you must also install Retail POS on the database server, even if Retail POS will not be used on that computer. This step is required to set up the database. Additionally, install Retail POS on a communications server if that computer will also be used to process transactions.

In AX 2012 R3, you can use the Retail mass deployment toolkit to deploy Retail POS to a large number of client computers. For more information, see [Mass deploy Retail components by using System Center Configuration Manager](mass-deploy-retail-components-by-using-system-center-configuration-manager.md).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you are upgrading Retail POS, you should review <A href="scenario-upgrade-a-retail-system.md">Scenario: Upgrade a Retail system</A>.</P>



## Before you install Retail POS

  - On the computer where you plan to install this component, run the prerequisite validation utility to verify that system requirements have been met. For information about how to run the prerequisite validation utility, see [Check prerequisites](check-prerequisites.md).
    
    For more information about the hardware and software requirements for Microsoft Dynamics AX, see the [system requirements](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=165377).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > <P>Install <A href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2703853">Microsoft Sync Framework hotfix 2703853</A> on all computers on which you install the Retail POS. This hotfix can prevent potential data loss when synchronizing Retail offline databases with the channel database.</P>
