# (RUS) Allocate charges to other item invoices to include allocations to an item cost price 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can allocate charges that are incurred from one vendor invoice to the cost of items in another vendor invoice. You can allocate expenses from a vendor invoice line to a non-stocked or category-based purchase order line. You can also allocate non-stocked or category-based vendor invoice lines to purchase items as expenses.

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Inquiries** \> **Journals** \> **Invoice journal**.

2.  Select a vendor invoice, and then click **Charges** \> **Allocation**.

3.  In the **Charges allocation** field, select the method to use to allocate the charges, from the following options:
    
      - **Net amount** – Charges are allocated according to each line amount relative to the total net amount of the service invoice.
    
      - **Quantity** – Charges are allocated according to the number of units for each line relative to the total number of units for the service invoice.
    
      - **Gross weight** – Charges are allocated equally, according to the gross weight of the items that are received.
    
      - **Volume** – Charges are allocated equally, according to the volume of the items that are received.

4.  In the **Posting date** field, select the date of the allocation transaction.

5.  Select the **Select** check box to select a posted invoice that includes charges.

6.  In the **Allocation mode** field, verify that **Include to the cost price** is selected. **Include to the cost price** is the default allocation mode.
