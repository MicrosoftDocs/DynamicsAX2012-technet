# (RUS) Activate corresponding mechanism for accounting transactions 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

The account correspondence mechanism allows you to create correspondence relations between transactions. When the account correspondence mechanism is turned on, each new accounting transaction created will consist of a set of two-way corresponding transactions. When posting the accounting transactions, the corresponding relation is defined automatically. If non-corresponded transactions existed before the account correspondence mechanism was turned on, they would not be linked automatically.

1.  Click **General ledger** \> **Setup** \> **General ledger parameters**.

2.  Click **Ledger**, and then select the **Use corresponding mechanism** check box to activate the account correspondence mechanism.

3.  Click **Number sequences** and then select the number sequence code for **Correspondence pack**.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>After the correspondence mechanism is activated, all new transactions will have correspondence relations. If you cannot establish a correspondence link for a transaction, a message with a warning is displayed. Click this message to go to the manual correspondence function to correspond the transactions manually.</P>
