# Assign a sequence group to an operation resource or resource group 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use this procedure to assign a sequence group to an operation resource or a resource group. You can use the sequence group to sequence the operations that are assigned to the resource or resource groups. You can assign a sequence group to a resource group, and then assign another sequence group to a resource within that resource group. When you assign the resource group as the requirement type for an operation in the route, the sequencing of operations is performed based on the sequence group assigned to the resource group.

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Common** \> **Resources** \> **Resources**.
    
    –or–
    
    Click **Organization administration** \> **Common** \> **Resources** \> **Resource groups**.

3.  Click the **General** FastTab.
