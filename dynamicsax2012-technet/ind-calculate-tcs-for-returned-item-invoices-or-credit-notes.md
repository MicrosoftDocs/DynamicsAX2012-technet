# (IND) Calculate TCS for returned item invoices or credit notes 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic has not been fully updated for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2.</P>



If you create a credit note or create a returned item invoice using a credit note, only the TCS amount that is calculated on the original invoice is reversed. The TCS amount is not reversed if the TCS is already paid to the authority or the TCS settlement process is already run for the period.

If the returned item invoice or credit note is posted for a partial quantity, the proportionate TCS amount will be reversed.
