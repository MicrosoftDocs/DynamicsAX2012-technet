# About setting up inventory reservations 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can specify default inventory settings in three different forms:

  - The **Accounts receivable parameters** form defines whether items should be reserved automatically or manually. For more information, see [About item reservations for orders](about-item-reservations-for-orders.md).

  - The **Item model groups** form defines how to set up reservation dates. For more information, see [About setting up date-controlled reservations](about-setting-up-date-controlled-reservations.md). Date-controlled reservation takes the date of receipt of goods into consideration during auto-reservation of batches.

  - The **Customers** form is used to set up the warehouse from which inventory should be reserved for the customer. For more information, see [Set up warehouse reservations](set-up-warehouse-reservations.md). Typically, inventory is reserved from the warehouse from which it is most convenient to deliver to the customer.
