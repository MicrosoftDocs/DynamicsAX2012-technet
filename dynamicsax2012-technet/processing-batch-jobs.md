# Processing batch jobs 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This section describes how to use batch jobs. Batch jobs allow you to run tasks, such as printing reports or posting journals, at a different time. Batch jobs are added to a queue and are run automatically by a batch server. By using batch jobs, you can avoid slowing down your computer or the server during typical working hours.
