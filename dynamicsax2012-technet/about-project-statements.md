# About project statements 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Microsoft Dynamics AX provides many reports that you can use to view details about the projects that you are managing. However, when you want a quick snapshot view of the progress on a project, you can create a project statement by using the **Project statements** form.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The profit calculations that you can make on the <STRONG>Project statements</STRONG> form is based in part on selections that you make in the <STRONG>Project statements</STRONG> area of the <STRONG>Project management and accounting parameters</STRONG> form. For more information, see <A href="about-setting-up-profit-calculation.md">About setting up profit calculation</A>.</P>



Open the **Project statements** form from any of the following forms:

  - **Project contract details**

  - **Project**

  - **Project groups**

  - **Worker**

  - **Project categories**

  - **Category groups**

  - **Project report sort fields**

  - **Worker**

## Select criteria for the calculation

When you run project statements, you can determine the criteria that are used to calculate the project statement by making selections on the **General** tab in the **Project statements** form. Select options in the following areas:

  - **Include project types** – Include or exclude specific project types for the cost control calculation. If you open the form from a specific project, by default these options are not available and the calculation uses the project type of the selected project.

  - **Include transaction types** – Include or exclude specific transaction types for the cost control calculation. If you open the form from a specific category or category group, by default these options are not available, and the calculation uses the transaction type of the selected category.

  - **Project date**/**Ledger date** – Include transactions in a selected date range based on either the project date or ledger date.

  - **Data** – Select whether to calculate and view actual transactions, forecasted transactions, or a comparison of the two.

## View calculation results

After a calculation has been run, the information is displayed on the following tabs in the **Project statements** form:

  - **General** – General information about the basic profit and loss structure of the project.

  - **Profit and loss** – Information about accrued revenue. You can also view general information about the basic profit and loss structure of the project.

  - **WIP** – Information about WIP account balances.

  - **Consumption** – Information about the consumption of hours, items, expenses, and payroll transactions.

  - **Invoice** – Information about invoices and on-account invoicing.

  - **Hour rate** – The hour rates for hours that are posted to revenue and cost accounts.
