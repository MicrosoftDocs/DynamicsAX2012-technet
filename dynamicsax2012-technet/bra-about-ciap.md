# (BRA) About CIAP [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

CIAP stands for “Controle de Crédito de ICMS do Ativo Permanente,” which is fixed asset tax credit control. When a legal entity buys a fixed asset, the ICMS tax credit, which is calculated on that transaction and is included in the fixed asset price, can be appropriated in 48 installments. In order to have the correct calculation for this tax refund, the legal entity must present a specific fiscal book or report the information in the SPED Fiscal file to demonstrate the correct appropriation of ICMS tax credit amount.
