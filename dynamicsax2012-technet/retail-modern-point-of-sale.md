# Retail Modern Point of Sale 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 includes Retail Modern POS, a point-of-sale app for PCs, tablets, and phones. Sales staff can process sales transactions, customer orders, and perform daily operations and inventory management with mobile devices anywhere in the store, as well as at PC-based registers.

The Retail Modern POS app can either connect to a database directly, or to Retail Server.

## Learn

Retail Modern POS clients can communicate with databases in your store, or Retail Servers that are deployed in your store or in a data center. Retail Modern POS clients can also communicate with peripheral devices such as cash drawers, credit card readers, and printers either directly, or by using Microsoft Dynamics AX Hardware Station. If you use Hardware Station, it must be deployed in your store, so that all Retail Modern POS clients can connect to the same Hardware Station.

## Extend

You can customize the behavior of your modern POS system in several ways. For example, you can modify the information that is made available to modern POS by extending a commerce entity to include a new column from your Microsoft Dynamics AX database. You can then make use of that new column in commerce runtime in a service and workflow, and then expose it in the commerce runtime API. Because you modified the commerce entity, you would also need to customize the corresponding controller and metadata in Retail Server. For an end to end customization example, see Walkthrough: Extend Modern Point of Sale for Microsoft Dynamics AX.

In other extensibility scenarios, you wouldn’t need to modify every layer of the stack. For example, you could simply modify the way a workflow behaves without modifying the database schema.

The Retail SDK includes apps for various clients. You can customize those apps to match the branding of your organization or to extend their functionality.

## Configure

Before you can process transactions or perform any other retail operations using Retail Modern POS, you must first set up your retail store in Microsoft Dynamics AX. Each retail store can have its own payment methods, price groups, point-of-sale (POS) registers, income accounts and expense accounts, and staff.

The following tables describe the configuration tasks that you must complete in Microsoft Dynamics AX for a retail store.
