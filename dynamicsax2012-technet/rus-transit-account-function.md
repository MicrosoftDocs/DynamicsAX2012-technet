# (RUS) Transit account function 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use the **Transit account** function to change the date of a posted transaction. The banking operation type must be created, and a transaction account must be set. This function is applied to transactions of the types **Bank-Bank**, **Cash account-Bank**, and **Ledger-Bank**.

You cannot post incoming or outgoing payments if the selected bank account is inactive, or if the receipt date of the banking operation is outside the period when the account is active.
