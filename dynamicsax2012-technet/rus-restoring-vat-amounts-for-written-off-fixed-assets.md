# (RUS) Restoring VAT amounts for written-off fixed assets 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Deducted value-added tax (VAT) amounts can be restored for a fixed asset in the following situations:

  - A fixed asset is written off.

  - A fixed asset is used in a VAT-free activity.

  - VAT-free tangible property is produced by using a fixed asset.

To check for any discrepancies in the values of the fixed asset, in the lower pane of the **VAT restoring journal** form, on the **Fixed assets** tab, verify the amount details for each fixed asset.


> [!NOTE]
