Before you can offer products for resale in your stores, you must create and configure the products in Retail essentials. You can create the products, define the product properties and attributes, and assign the products to retail category hierarchies. To make the products available to your stores and add the products to an active assortment, you must release the products to the legal entities in which they are available.
