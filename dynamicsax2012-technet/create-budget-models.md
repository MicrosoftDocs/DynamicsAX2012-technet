# Create budget models 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use the **Budget model** form to create various budget models. You can use a single budget model for all or some of the budgets, or you can create a budget model for each budget.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic includes information about financial budgets. For information about budgets for projects, see <A href="about-project-budgets-and-forecasts.md">About project budgets and forecasts</A>.</P>



A budget model can contain many submodels, which you attach to the budget model on the **Submodel** FastTab. For example, you could create a budget that has submodels that represent the various departments of the legal entity.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Budget models that are used as submodels cannot contain other submodels. Also, if you use budget control, you cannot use budget models that have submodels.</P>



In the **Budget model** form, you can select the following check boxes for budgets that are based on a specific budget model:

  - To indicate that the budget model and the budgets that are based on the model cannot be changed, select the **Stopped** check box.

  - To indicate that budgets that are created from the budget model are included in cash flow forecasting, select the **Cash flow forecasts** check box.

<!-- end list -->

1.  Click **Budgeting** \> **Setup** \> **Basic budgeting** \> **Budget models**.

2.  Click **New** to create a budget model.

3.  Enter an identifier and a name for the budget model.

4.  Enter other details about the model as needed, and add any submodels. For more information, see [Budget model (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa586905\(v=ax.60\)).
