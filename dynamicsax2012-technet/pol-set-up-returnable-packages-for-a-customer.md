# (POL) Set up returnable packages for a customer 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use the **Return packages table** form to register packages that are returned by a customer, define packaging codes, and specify the deposit amount that is paid by the customer for each of the returned packages.

You can define the packing units and packing groups for an item in the **Packing units** form. You can set up number sequences for packing vouchers in the **Accounts receivable parameters** form.

## Set up a packaging code and specify the deposit amount

1.  Click **Inventory management** \> **Setup** \> **Packing material** \> **Return packages**.

2.  In the **Packaging code** field, enter a unique code for the returned package.

3.  In the **Package description** field, enter a description for the returned package.

4.  In the **Deposit** field, enter the deposit amount that is paid by the customer for the returned package.
