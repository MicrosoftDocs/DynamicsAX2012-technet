This topic describes the table collections that must be set up to support some common virtual company scenarios in the Travel and expense module of Microsoft Dynamics AX. For an overview of the concept of virtual companies, and for step-by-step instructions to create table collections and virtual company accounts, see [Virtual company accounts in Microsoft Dynamics AX](virtual-company-accounts-in-microsoft-dynamics-ax.md).

## Scenario: Share merchants

To share merchants for expense reports among company accounts, create a **Merchants** table collection to include in a virtual company. Include the TrvExpMerchant table in the table collection.
