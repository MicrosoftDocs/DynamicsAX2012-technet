# Set up application bookmarks 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When you send letters or email messages to applicants, you can use application bookmarks to automatically insert information about an applicant and the job that the applicant applied for. An application bookmark is a field that you make available for use in the templates for application email messages and application documents. You must set up application bookmarks for correspondence actions before you can create templates for application email messages and application documents.

For example, suppose that Lisa Andrews is an external applicant. She submitted an application for employment in response to a job ad that you created for the SO Processor recruitment project. After you evaluate Lisa’s qualifications, you determine that she is not qualified to be a sales order processor, and you will send her a rejection letter. Instead of creating a rejection letter manually, you use a template for application email messages. Lisa’s name and the job that she applied for are inserted automatically into the email message because the template that you used contains bookmarked fields for the applicant’s name and the job that the applicant applied for.

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Setup** \> **Recruitment** \> **Application bookmarks**.

2.  In the left pane, select the correspondence action to set up application bookmarks for.

3.  In the **Available fields** list, select a field, and then move the field into the **Bookmark fields** list. The field can now be used in the templates for application email messages or application documents for the correspondence action that you selected in step 2.

4.  Repeat step 3 for additional fields to make them available for use in application email templates or application document templates.

5.  Repeat steps 2 through 4 for each correspondence action.
