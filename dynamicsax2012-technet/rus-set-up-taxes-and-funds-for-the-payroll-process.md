## 1\. Set up a tax deduction code for income tax calculation

Use the **Deduction, discount, and relief codes** form to set up a deduction, discount, and relief code to calculate tax deductions to reduce the taxable base.

To set up a tax deduction code for income tax calculation, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Settlements with tax authorities** \> **Setup** \> **Income tax** \> **Deduction, discount, and relief codes**.

2.  Click **New** or press CTRL+N to create a tax deduction code.

3.  In the **Deduction code** and **Name** fields, enter an identification code and a name for the deduction code.

4.  In the **Deduction type** field, select the deduction code type.
    
    Select from the following options:
    
      - **Standard** – The deduction code applies to incomes of any pay type.
    
      - **Others** – The deduction code applies only to incomes of the pay types that use the income code to which you assign the deduction code.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Microsoft Dynamics AX applies the <STRONG>Others</STRONG> deductions to calculate tax deductions to reduce the taxable base before applying the <STRONG>Standard</STRONG> deductions.</P>



5.  Select the **For relative** check box to indicate that the deduction amount applies to the income of employees who have specific relatives, such as a brother, sister, son, daughter, mother, father, wife, or husband. For more information, see “1. Create and post a payroll journal” and “4. Verify worker payments and deductions” in [(RUS) Generate pay statements](rus-generate-pay-statements.md).

6.  In the **Rate (reference)** field, select the identification code of a payroll rate for the deduction code that is used by an employee.

7.  In the **Rate (value)** field, select the identification code of a payroll rate that determines the deduction amount.

8.  In the **Sequence** field, select the identification code of a sequence in which the deduction amount is calculated in the tax calculation procedure.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>This field is available only if you specify a rate in the <STRONG>Rate (reference)</STRONG> field and leave the <STRONG>Rate (value)</STRONG> field blank.</P>



9.  In the **Period of validity** field, select the duration that the deduction is valid for.

10. Select the **Tax refund** check box to allow a tax refund related to this deduction provision retroactively if the tax was already deducted at the beginning of the year.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You can select this check box only if you select <STRONG>Standard</STRONG> in the <STRONG>Deduction type</STRONG> field.</P>



11. Select the **Financial interest storno adjustment** check box to allow the storno adjustment of the loan-related financial interest along with this deduction provision.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>When an employee receives financial interest on borrowed amounts, the related taxes are deducted from the employee’s pay. If the employee confirms that this borrowed money is spent to purchase a house or a flat, all of the interest that is calculated is storno adjusted, and the employee gets a tax refund. For more information about borrowing deductions, see “2. Create borrowing deductions and calculate standard deductions” in (RUS) Configure standard deductions calculation.</P>



## 2\. Set up an income group for income tax calculations

Use the **Income groups for NDFL** to set up an income group that is used to calculate income taxes for a particular tax residence status and income type combination.

To set up an income group for income tax calculations, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll (Russia)** \> **Settlements with tax authorities** \> **Setup** \> **Income tax** \> **Income groups for NDFL**.

2.  Click **New** or press CTRL+N to create an income group.

3.  In the **Income group code** and **Name** fields, enter an identification code and a name for the income group.

4.  In the **Tax status** field, select the tax status of the employees that the income group applies to.
    
    Select from the following options:
    
      - **Resident** – The tax group applies to residents.
    
      - **Non-resident** – The tax group applies to non-residents.
    
      - **High paid non-resident** – The tax group applies to highly paid non-residents.

5.  In the **System rate** field, select a rate to apply to all of the employees of the legal entity.

6.  In the **Group rate** field, select a rate to apply to all of the employees in a payroll group instead of applying the value that you specify in the **System rate** field.

7.  In the **Fund** field, select a calculation base code for the income group.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You cannot select the same calculation base for different income groups that have the same tax residence status. This ensures that a single pay type in a calculation base appears only once in the tax base.</P>



8.  Select the **Standard deductions** check box to apply standard deductions to the income group.

9.  Select the **Other deductions** check box to apply other deductions to the income group.

10. In the **Sales tax code** field, select the sales tax code that applies to the income group.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>This sales tax code is assigned to the head office of the legal entity. The sales tax codes for each separate division are determined based on the codes that are assigned to the same sales tax group that contains the head office sales tax code.</P>



11. In the **Pay type** field, select the pay type that is used to register payroll transactions that are related to this income group for the tax that is calculated for the current fiscal year.

12. On the **General** tab, specify values in the following fields:
    
    1.  In the **Future period tax** field, select the pay type that is used to register payroll transactions that are related to this income group for the tax that is calculated for the future fiscal year.
    
    2.  In the **Last year’s debts repayment** field, select the pay type that is used to register payroll transactions that are related to this income group for the tax that is calculated for the previous fiscal year.
    
    3.  In the **Budget revenue code** field, select the classification code for budget revenue.
        

        > [!NOTE]
        > <P>You cannot select the same budget revenue code for multiple sales tax codes. This ensures that the selected budget revenue code tax payment document is unambiguously linked to a particular income group and the tax liability that is related to the document is used in the tax settlement.</P>



## 3\. Set up an income code for income tax calculations

      - **Fund deduction** – The deduction code is used for fund deductions only.
    
      - **Tax deduction** – The deduction code is configured by reusing the setup information for a tax deduction.
    
      - **Deductions in income types** – The deduction code applies to the earnings of specific pay types.
