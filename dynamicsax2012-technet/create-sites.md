# Create sites 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use this procedure to create one or more sites.

1.  Click **Inventory management** \> **Setup** \> **Inventory breakdown** \> **Sites**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a new entry.

3.  Enter a unique identifier and a description for the site.

4.  On the **General** FastTab, select a time zone. If you do not specify a time zone, the time zone that is defined in the **Company information** form is used as the default time zone.

5.  Save the entry.

After you have created a site, you can delete it, provided that the following conditions are met:

  - The site is not referenced from warehouses, production resources, or other master data.

  - No open on-hand inventory is associated with the site.

If either of these conditions exists, a message is displayed and you cannot delete the site.
