# Apply overrides 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to override item prices or charges on a sales order and how to complete a discount override on a sales order. Use overrides to increase or decrease an original charge amount at either the header level or line level of an order.
