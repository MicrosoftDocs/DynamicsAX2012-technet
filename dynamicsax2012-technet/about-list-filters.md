# About list filters 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

By using filters, you can display subsets of list information, based on criteria that you specify. This topic describes the filtering options that are available in Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX.

## The Quick Filter

The Quick Filter includes a text box and a list where you can select a field. The Quick Filter is located at the top of most list pages in Enterprise Portal. The following figure shows the location of the Quick Filter on a list page.

To use the Quick Filter, you specify one set of criteria, such as a specific name in a **Name** field or a telephone number in a **Telephone Number** field. After you apply the filter, the list page displays all records that contain the specified word or value in the specified field.

## The Advanced Filter

By using the Advanced Filter, you can specify multiple sets of criteria for multiple fields. You can use multiple operators, values, and words. The following figure shows an example of the Advanced Filter.

In the Microsoft Dynamics AX client, you can use the Advanced Filter to save a filter as a Cue. In Enterprise Portal, the Advanced Filter does not include this functionality. To learn more about advanced filtering in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client, see "Advanced filtering and query options" in the Microsoft Dynamics AX client Help.
