# Assign a worker to meters or process references 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can assign employees to a process reference or a meter that the employees are responsible for monitoring. For example, you assign your environmental manager the responsibility of reading and entering the data that is gathered about your organization’s emissions of hydrofluorocarbons. You then set up the assignment so that the reading and data entry must be completed one time every two weeks.

1.  Click **Compliance and internal controls** \> **Common** \> **Environmental sustainability** \> **Meters**.

2.  Select the process reference or meter that you want to assign an employee to, and then click **Assignments**.

3.  In the **Assignments** form, click **New** to add an employee assignment.

4.  Select the identifier of the employee that you want to assign to the process reference or meter.

5.  Select the group that the employee belongs to.

6.  Enter the frequency and interval times to specify how often the employee must monitor and report the data for the process reference or meter. For example, you enter 2 in the **Frequency** field, and then select **Week** in the **Entry interval** field. In this case, the data for the process reference or meter must be entered one time every two weeks.
