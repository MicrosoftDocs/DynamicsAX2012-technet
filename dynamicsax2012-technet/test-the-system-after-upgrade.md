# Test the system after upgrade 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

After you finish upgrade, test whether your Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 installation is functioning properly.

To test whether upgrade succeeded, perform (at a minimum) these tasks:

  - Restart all Application Object Server (AOS) instances.

  - Launch a client that is connected to each AOS instance that is running.

  - Test that users can execute the most common tasks for your system.

  - Test that the administrator can run the system maintenance tasks.

  - Test that developers can create a new development workspace and create code projects.

  - Test that users can execute the most vital tasks for your installation.

  - Test that users can read the reports that are generated.

  - Test that the security roles are working correctly. Users in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 should have access to the data they had access to on the source system and they should be able to do all the tasks for their assigned roles.

  - Validate that your Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 data is consistent with the Microsoft Dynamics AX source system data prior to upgrade.

  - Verify that features that required code upgrade function as expected on the new system.
