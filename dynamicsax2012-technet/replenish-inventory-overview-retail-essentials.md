## Methods for replenishing inventory

Typically, replenishment is performed at the head office. You can replenish the inventory at stores by using two methods:

  - **Cross-docking** – Create transfer orders that are based on purchase orders.
    
    The term cross-docking originated in distribution warehouses. At these warehouses, trucks arrive on one side of the loading dock, the shipments are unloaded and reorganized by destination, and then the shipments are loaded onto outgoing trucks on the other side of the loading dock.

  - **Buyer's push** – Create original transfer orders.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Regardless of which replenishment method you use, if the stores that inventory is being distributed to are in another legal entity, sales orders and purchase orders are automatically created.</P>



For both replenishment methods, you can specify one of three distribution methods:

  - Distribution based on location weight

  - Distribution based on replenishment rules

  - Distribution of a fixed quantity to all stores

Before you use either cross-docking or buyer's push to replenish inventory, you should set up the following elements:

  - Organization hierarchy

  - Replenishment rules

  - Service categories
