# Apply payments in sales orders 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

When you create a sales order for a call center, you can enter the customer's payment information directly into the sales order and then submit the payment. This topic describes how to enter and submit payment information for a sales order.

Call centers can accept any of the payment methods that have been set up for the call center, including cash, check, credit card, gift card, and customer accounts. Customers can also use multiple payment methods in a single order.

## Prerequisites

The following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you start.
