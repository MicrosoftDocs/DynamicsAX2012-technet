# What's new: Warehouse management features 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

A new module, **Warehouse management**, has been added in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3. This topic is a high-level overview of the feature areas that are included in the new module, and it also lists the new Warehouse management features that were added in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 Cumulative Update 8.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 includes new Warehouse and Transportation management modules that are enabled by a single configuration key, along with the previously released Warehouse management II module. Users should enable the configuration key for <STRONG>ONLY ONE</STRONG> of these modules, but not both, in a single-instance, single-partition deployment. Although technically feasible, enabling the configuration keys for both of these modules in a single-instance, single-partition deployment is not supported by Microsoft.&nbsp;</P>



## Workflows

Configure inbound and outbound workflows for standardized processes in **Production** and **Inventory management**. For more information, see the following topics:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><a href="setting-up-inbound-processes.md">Setting up inbound processes</a></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><a href="setting-up-outbound-processes.md">Setting up outbound processes</a></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Cluster picking

Assign orders to clusters to pick from a single location and configure profiles to control the validation and packing of items into shipping containers. For more information, see the following topic:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><a href="set-up-cluster-picking.md">Set up cluster picking</a></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Wave processing

Create and release work through automatic or manual processing of waves. For example, you can use waves to create, process, and release picking work for outbound loads or shipments. For more information, see the following topics:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><a href="set-up-warehouse-parameters-for-wave-processing.md">Set up warehouse parameters for wave processing</a></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><a href="create-a-wave-template.md">Create a wave template</a></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><a href="wave-processing.md">Wave processing</a></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Inventory control

Set up cycle counting thresholds, schedule plans, apply ad-hoc cycle counting, and configure real-time replenishment. For more information, see the following topic:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><a href="cycle-counting.md">Cycle counting</a></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Containerization

Set up container groups to sequence packing processes and create templates that support packing strategies. For example, by using automated containerization, you can have containers and picking work created for shipments when a wave is processed. For more information, see the following topic:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><a href="set-up-containerization.md">Set up containerization</a></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Mobile devices

Use scanners and other mobile devices to optimize precision in the picking and put-away processes. You can configure the flow for system-directed push strategies and user-directed pull strategies. For more information, see the following topic:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><a href="setting-up-mobile-devices.md">Setting up mobile devices</a></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Deferred reservation strategy

Defer reservation details beyond the point of entering an order. The deferred reservation strategy is based on a reservation hierarchy, which you can assign to inventory items. For more information, see the following topic:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><a href="set-up-reservation-hierarchies.md">Set up reservation hierarchies</a></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Work

Monitor the processing and the amount of work in a warehouse, push work to dedicated warehouse workers, and trace completed work. For more information, see the following topic:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><a href="set-up-a-work-pool.md">Set up a work pool</a></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Integration with the Quality control module

Include quality control in any inbound or outbound processes that you set up for warehouse items. For example, the quality control features enable you to prevent reservation of items that have not passed a quality test. For more information, see the following topics:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><a href="testing-products-sample.md">Testing products (sample)</a></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><a href="inventory-blocking.md">Inventory blocking</a></p></td>
</tr>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Use cross-docking to move packages of products through a warehouse while using limited or no storage</p></td>
<td><p>Cross-docking is useful if you purchase products from different vendors, the vendors prepack cartons that contain a mix of products or product variants, and you want distribute the cartons to one or more retail stores. This feature works with or without the Warehouse management module.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="cross-docking-packages-in-warehouse-management.md">Cross docking packages in Warehouse management</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Set up a company policy for sales order fulfillment and create batch jobs to release sales orders and transfer orders to the warehouse</p></td>
<td><p>You need to set up a default company policy for sales order fulfillment rates. The policy controls the percentage of the total price or the quantity of an order that must be reserved physical before a sales order can be released to the warehouse. You can also set up a policy for specific customers. Customer-specific policies override the default policy.</p>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Allocate batch numbers in Warehouse management</p></td>
<td><p>You can define policies that control when batch numbers are allocated by setting up one or more number groups, and then assigning them to products. It’s possible to allocate batch numbers when you perform a physical receipt of a product, or when you create a line that includes a product on a source document, such as a purchase order. You can also manually allocate batch numbers to products.</p>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Use product variants in warehouse management processes</p></td>
<td><p>Product variants are defined by product masters with product dimension variations, for example, a single towel in different sizes and colors. Instead of creating multiple products, you create a single product master and use the various combinations of sizes and colors as different product variants. You can use product variants in the following processes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To define stocking limits.</p></li>
<li><p>To configure work confirmation and bar code scanning on mobile devices.</p></li>
<li><p>To create replenishment templates.</p></li>
<li><p>To set up rules for converting units of measure.</p></li>
<li><p>To assign fixed warehouse locations.</p></li>

<p></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Use additional production processes in a warehouse</p></td>
<td><p>It’s now possible to use the following production processes in a warehouse:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deliver picked materials to the exact locations where the materials are consumed in production.</p></li>
<li><p>Define a specific output location for a production order or a batch order. This enables the warehouse worker to know exactly where to pick up the goods for put away work.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate put away work for warehouse-enabled items when you use the reporting as finish process on the Microsoft Dynamics AX client. (Previously you could only do this from a mobile device.)</p></li>
</ul>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Use bar code lookup in inbound processes</p></td>
<td><p>Bar code lookup functionality can be used with products and product variants to support several inbound operations that are carried out by warehouse workers on mobile devices.</p>
