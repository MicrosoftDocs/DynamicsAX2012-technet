You can specify that each purchase or planned purchase must be validated during processing to guarantee that the purchase does not exceed the budget funds that are available. You can use budget control for journals of the daily, allocation, and project expense account types. The vendor invoice recording journal and the vendor invoice approval journal can also be included in budget control. If you are using budget control for expense accounts, authorized users can override the available budget by transferring budget funds from other accounts. Those users can also reject purchases.</p>

Additionally, it is now easier to identify newly transferred budget register entries in the <strong>Budget register entry</strong> form, because these entries have a budget type that resembles their origin. For example, budget register entries that are created from a fixed asset budget transfer have a budget type of <strong>Fixed assets</strong>.</p>

The vendor invoice distribution accounts and amounts are validated to determine whether budget funds are available. If the budget check is successful, budget tracking records are created that have a category of <strong>Actual expenditures</strong>. The whole cost of the vendor invoice line is evaluated. Any taxes or charges are included in the evaluation. The date on the vendor invoice line is associated with the appropriate fiscal period and budget interval to determine the budget period for validation.</p>

<td><p>Budgeting workflows</p></td>
<td><p>When you set up a review workflow, you can associate the workflow with a budget code to require that budget register entries use a review process. When a specified budget code is used on a budget register entry, a review process is required. You can define conditional statements for the review process to determine whether budget register entries are manually or automatically reviewed and approved. If you are using budget control, you can set up workflows so that a budget manager can approve budget register entries. Each budget account entry on a budget register entry can have its own review process. You can also set up rules that are independent of any review processes. For example, you can set up budget transfer rules to allow the transfer of budget funds among only a subset of departments. If budget transfer rules are violated, budget register entries can be assigned to a specific user for approval.</p>

## More about budget control in AX 2012

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, budgeting was primarily informational. AX 2012 provides budgeting and budget control solutions for public and private sector organizations. Budget register entries have replaced ledger budget tables, and are available in workflows that can be used for routing and review.

Budget control is a process that monitors a budget, and that can provide feedback about the availability of funds when budget register entries, accounting journals, and source documents such as purchase orders and invoices are entered. Although budgeting and budget control are important to any organization that wants to control spending, they are of particular interest to public sector organizations, because the budgets of these organizations are often enacted into law and cannot easily be exceeded or revised.

## New functionality in budget control

Budget register entries are now used to create budgets and provide an audit trail of budget-related activities. Budget register entries can be categorized by transaction type, such as amendment, transfer, and original budget. Therefore, you can quickly understand how a budget has changed. Workflows can guarantee that budget register entries undergo review. Existing AX 2009 ledger budget records are converted to budget register entries in AX 2012.

Budget control is based on the ledger for a legal entity. Users can define budget control to monitor budgets and provide feedback about the availability of funds. Users can also define the calculation that determines the budget funds that are available, and can specify dimensions and dimension values separately from a main account for budget control.

## Special considerations for budget control

There are three system configurations for budgeting and budget control:

  - Basic configuration provides budget register entries and workflows.

  - Advanced configuration adds budget control.

  - Public sector configuration adds apportionment and preliminary budget register entries.

## Comparison with budget control in AX 2009

Budgeting and budget control has changed considerably since AX 2009. AX 2012 includes changes to the following areas:

  - Budget manager/analyst Role Center

  - Financial dimensions for budgeting and budget control

  - Budget rate type and exchange rates

  - Budget models

  - Budget cycles

  - Budget control configuration

  - Budget control on source documents and accounting journals

  - Budget register entries

  - Workflow for budget register entries

  - Budget transfer rules

  - Budget transfers, allocations, and recurrences

  - Budget reports and inquiries

  - Web services interface for budget register entries

## More information

For more information about budgeting and budget control, see the white papers [Implementing the Budget Control Framework for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Applications](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=213130%26clcid=0x409) and [Implementing Budgeting for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Applications](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=213129%26clcid=0x409).

## More about budget planning in AX 2012 R2

AX 2012 R2 adds budget planning to the **Budgeting** module that was introduced in AX 2012.

Budget planning is the process of preparing the budgets that will be adopted by an organization. Private sector and public sector organizations can configure budget planning, and set up their own budget planning processes that are secure, flexible, and easy to use. By using budget planning, you can perform the following tasks:

  - Associate budget planning processes with budget cycles, ledgers, and organization hierarchies.

  - Analyze and update budget plans by using multiple scenarios. You can then automatically route the budget plans together with worksheets, justifications, and attachments for reviews and approvals.

  - Consolidate multiple budget plans at one level of the organization into a single parent budget plan at a higher level in the organization. You can also develop a single budget plan at a high level in the organization and allocate the budget to lower levels of the organization.

## New functionality in budget planning

Budget planning builds on key features that are introduced in AX 2012, such as the role-based and data security models, the financial dimension framework, account structures, and account rules. Budget planning adds budget planning advanced rules and additional tasks and elements to workflow. You can configure workflows to review and approve budget plans, and to integrate the stages in your budget planning processes with the business requirements of your budget planning organization.

Budget planning is integrated with other AX 2012 R2 modules, so that you can bring in information from previous budgets, actual expenditures, fixed assets, and human resources. Budget planning is also integrated with Excel and Microsoft Word, so that you can use these tools to work with your budgeting data. For example, a budget manager can import a department’s budget request to an Excel worksheet from a budget plan scenario. The data can be analyzed, updated, charted, and then published back to the budget plan lines, where the data can be routed for approval.

## Special considerations for budget planning

The budget manager must be assigned to a role that has permission to create and maintain organization hierarchies. The budget manager should either create an organization hierarchy that has a **Budget planning** purpose or assign the **Budget planning** purpose to an existing organization hierarchy.

Workflows route the budget plans through the organization, based on the workers in the budgeting organization hierarchy. Users who work with budget planning must be associated with workers whose positions report to an organization unit in the budget planning organization hierarchy. If users outside the budget planning organization hierarchy have to review budget plans, these users must be assigned to a budget planning user group that can be associated with the budget plan that they have to review.

Office Add-ins must be configured and enabled, and a template author must build the Excel and Word templates. The templates are used to structure the data for the worksheets and justifications by using the fields that are available through the Budget planning web service. For Enterprise Portal, network locations that have the appropriate security must be available for the templates, attachments, worksheets, and justifications.

## Comparison with budget planning in AX 2009

  - Financial dimensions for budget planning

  - Budget planning and Office Add-ins

  - Budget planning configuration

  - Budget planning workflow configuration

  - Proposed projects and proposed fixed assets

  - Budget planning processes

  - Generating budget plans from source data

  - Budget plan data entry
