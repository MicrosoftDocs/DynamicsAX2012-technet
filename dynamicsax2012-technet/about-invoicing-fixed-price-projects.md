# About invoicing fixed-price projects [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Invoicing a fixed-price project consists of defining a billing schedule and performing the invoicing procedure.

## Billing schedule

You can invoice fixed-price projects on a billing schedule. You set up the billing schedule for the project in the **On-account** form. (Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Inquiries** \> **Transactions** \> **On-account**.)

The billing schedule is defined in terms of one or more milestones for the project. You specify payment for each milestone in the **On-account** form.

For example, you can set up a billing schedule as follows:

  - 20 percent when the project contract is signed.

  - 30 percent on first delivery.

  - 15 percent on second delivery.

  - 35 percent on final delivery

## Invoicing procedure

When the milestone payments are ready to be invoiced, you apply the procedure for invoicing on-account amounts.
