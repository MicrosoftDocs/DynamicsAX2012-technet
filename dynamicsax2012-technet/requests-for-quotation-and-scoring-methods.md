# Requests for quotation and scoring methods 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

This feature is available only if **eProcurement** in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 is installed.

Assigning a score to a bid is useful when you compare replies to requests for quotation (bids). This topic contains frequently asked questions that you might have about scoring methods and criteria.

A scoring method consists of a set of scoring criteria that apply to the RFQ case. For example, you might want to rate a vendor on past performance, or rate whether the company is environmentally friendly or a good collaborator, or give a score based on price. Typically, a purchasing manager creates scoring methods and criteria for purchasing agents to use. One or more methods and criteria can then be assigned as a default for a solicitation type, so that when you create a new RFQ of that type, the set of criteria defined by the method is automatically applied to the case that you create. For more information, see [Create and use a solicitation type](create-and-use-a-solicitation-type.md).

## How do I create scoring methods and criteria?

Typically, you first create the method, and give it a name and description that indicate the type of criteria youâ€™ll be rating, such as price. Then you create the criteria, which could be unit price or discount, for example, and you create a range for scoring, such as currency or points.

You perform these tasks on the **Scoring method** form. (Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Setup** \> **Request for quotation** \> **Scoring method**.) For more information, see [Create and use scoring criteria and methods](create-and-use-scoring-criteria-and-methods.md).

## How do I apply a scoring method to my RFQ?

You apply the scoring method to the RFQ on the **Request for quotation details** page, by clicking **Scoring criteria** on the **Action pane**. You can also change an existing method, and you can add or delete criteria, if no scoring has been done for any of the RFQ replies. For more information, see [Create and use scoring criteria and methods](create-and-use-scoring-criteria-and-methods.md).

## Where do I assign scores to received bids?

When you receive a reply to your RFQ (a bid), open it, and fill in the scores for your criteria on the **Requests for quotations reply details** form, on the **Bid scoring** FastTab. When all the bids are scored, you can compare the scores and rank them. For more information, see [Compare bids and award a contract](compare-bids-and-award-a-contract.md).
