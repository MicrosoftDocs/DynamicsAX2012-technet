# Post packing slips and update information for shipping carriers 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This topic applies to features in the **Inventory management** module. It does not apply to features in the [Warehouse management](warehouse-management.md) module.

Use this information to post packing slips and update shipping carrier information for sales orders. If the **Shipping carrier** configuration key is selected, shipping information for a sales order must be transferred to the shipping carrier software from Microsoft Dynamics AX before the invoice for the sales order can be posted.

You can view shipping information in the sales **Packing slip journal** form and in the **Carrier transaction information** form.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If the <STRONG>Test mode</STRONG> check box is selected for the shipping carrier software interface, the <STRONG>Test mode</STRONG> form is displayed for each packing slip that you post. Use this form to enter information to simulate the information that you would receive from the shipping carrier software. When you are satisfied that shipping carrier information is set up correctly in Microsoft Dynamics AX, clear the <STRONG>Test mode</STRONG> check box to enable the system to transfer information from the shipping carrier software.</P>

If the card is rejected, a message is displayed and the invoice is not printed. You can remove the shipment from additional processing, and then notify the employee who is responsible for invoicing that the credit card was rejected.</P>

    
      - For the invoices that are posted, shipping charges are moved to the invoice as miscellaneous charges. For more information, see [About sales order information for shipping carriers](about-sales-order-information-for-shipping-carriers.md).
