# View history for a distribution schedule 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

The **Download history** form shows information about the jobs that were previously run for a selected distribution schedule. A run of a job is referred to as a session. Use the information in this form for troubleshooting. You can also run a session again from this form.

To display complete status information in this form, you must run the batch job that processes status messages for Commerce Data Exchange. For more information, see [Process status messages for data exchange](process-status-messages-for-data-exchange.md).

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Periodic** \> **Data distribution** \> **Distribution schedule**.

2.  Select a distribution schedule, and then click **History**.

3.  In the **Download history** form, you can view the following information about each session that was tried for the selected distribution schedule.

    <li><p><strong>Create failed</strong> – The data package could not be created. Review the detailed error message for more information.</p>
    <p>After you have resolved the error, run the distribution schedule again. If the distribution schedule runs as part of a batch job, it is run again the next time that the batch job runs.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Download failed</strong> – The data package could not be downloaded. Review the detailed error message for more information.</p>
    <p>After you have resolved the error, Async Client tries the download again according to the retry interval.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Apply failed</strong> – The data package could not be applied to the channel database. Review the detailed error message for more information.</p>
    <p>If there is a configuration issue, fix the issue, and wait for the next retry by Async Client. If there is a data issue that you can’t resolve by modifying the database schema, cancel the session.
