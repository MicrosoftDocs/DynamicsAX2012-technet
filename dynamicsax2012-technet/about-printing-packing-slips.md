# About printing packing slips 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

If you work with direct delivery, a packing slip can be printed automatically for the intercompany purchase order and the original sales order when you post the packing slip on the intercompany sales order.

To print packing slips automatically, in the **Intercompany** form for purchase orders, select both of the **Print packing slip automatically** fields.

If you update the packing slip on the intercompany sales order, the changes are reflected automatically on the intercompany purchase order and the original sales order.
