# (JPN) Depreciate and retire a fixed asset with asset retirement obligation 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

After you set up an asset retirement obligation (ARO) document and attach it to a fixed asset, you can acquire a fixed asset and generate an ARO transaction during the acquisition. You can adjust ARO amounts up or down to calculate interest expenses in case there are changes in the estimated retirement cost for the fixed asset. You can depreciate the fixed asset over the course of its useful life, and then retire the asset.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic does not apply to versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 prior to cumulative update 7 for AX 2012 R2.</P>



When you acquire a fixed asset, you can generate an ARO transaction to post the ARO amounts to the ledger during the acquisition. To do this, when you create an acquisition journal for the fixed asset, click **Functions** \> **Generate asset retirement obligation transactions** on the **Journal voucher** form. The ARO transactions are created in the **Journal voucher** form based on the ARO document that you attached to the fixed asset. You can then post the ARO transactions by clicking **Post**. For more information, see [Journal voucher - Fixed assets (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa620564\(v=ax.60\)).

Follow the steps in this topic to generate an ARO proposal for an interest expense, retire a fixed asset, and view ARO settlement amounts.

## Generate an ARO proposal for an interest expense

Use the **Journal voucher** form to generate an ARO proposal for an interest expense, and then post the interest expense. You can generate this proposal at the end of each quarter or fiscal year of the asset’s useful life.

To generate the ARO proposal for an interest expense, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Journals** \> **Fixed assets**.

2.  Select the fixed asset to generate the proposal for, and then click **Lines**.

3.  In the **Journal voucher** form, select the acquisition journal that is used to acquire the fixed asset, and then click, **Proposals** \> **Asset retirement obligation - accretion expense**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You must use this option only when the acquisition date and the date when ARO is recognized for the asset are on the same day. If ARO is recognized after the acquisition date, you must click <STRONG>Proposals</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Capitalized asset retirement obligation</STRONG>.</P>



4.  In the **To date** field, select the ending date of the period to generate the proposal for.

5.  Click **Select** to specify a query to filter the assets that are included in the proposal, and then click **OK**.

6.  In the **Asset retirement obligation - accretion expense** form, click **OK** to generate the interest expense proposal.

7.  In the **Journal voucher** form, click **Post** to post the journal.

You can use the **Asset retirement obligation details** form to view the posted ARO amounts for the fixed asset. For more information, see [(JPN) Set up asset retirement obligation for fixed assets](jpn-set-up-asset-retirement-obligation-for-fixed-assets.md).

## Retire a fixed asset and view ARO settlement amounts

After you depreciate the asset and post subsequent ARO amounts over the course of the asset’s useful life, you can use the **Fixed asset posting profiles** form to retire the asset. For more information, see [About fixed asset disposal](about-fixed-asset-disposal.md).

After you retire the asset, you can use the **Value models** form to view the ARO settlement amounts.

To view ARO settlement amounts, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Common** \> **Fixed assets** \> **Fixed assets**.

2.  Select the fixed asset that you retired, and then click **Value models**.

3.  In the **Value models** form, click **Inquiry** \> **Profile**.

4.  In the **Profile** form, in the **Amortization of asset retirement obligation** field, you can view the ARO settlement amounts for each month of the fixed asset’s useful life.
