A single Microsoft Dynamics AX implementation can include multiple legal entities. You can use the **Select company** form to open a different legal entity. You can also specify the legal entity that should open by default every time that you start Microsoft Dynamics AX.

## Open a different legal entity

Use one of the following two methods to open a different legal entity.

  - On the address bar, click the first arrow in the address bar, and then select the legal entity to open.

  - On the status bar, click the identifier of the current legal entity, such as DAT, to open the **Select company** form. Select the legal entity to open, and then click **OK**.

## Select a default legal entity

1.  Click **File** \> **Tools** \> **Options**.

2.  In the **Start company accounts** field, select the legal entity to open every time that you start Microsoft Dynamics AX, and then click **Close**.
