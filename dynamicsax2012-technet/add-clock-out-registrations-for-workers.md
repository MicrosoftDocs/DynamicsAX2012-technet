# Add clock-out registrations for workers 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A supervisor or manager can insert missing clock-out registrations for workers who forgot to make those registrations. Missing clock-out registrations can be inserted by running a batch job for a group of workers, or for one worker at a time.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>It is also possible to make clock-in registrations for workers, but it is more likely that a missing registration form a worker is a clock-out registration.</P>



## Clock out a worker

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Common** \> **Time and attendance** \> **Calculate**.

2.  Select the worker, and then click **Clock-in and out** \> **Missing clock-out**.

3.  In the **Clock out** section, insert the **Date** and **Time** for the clock-out registration.

4.  To create a clock out registration record in the raw registrations table, select the **Create lines** check box.

## Clock out a group of workers

1.  Click **Human resources** \> **Common** \> **Time and attendance** \> **Approve**.

2.  Click **Clock-in and out** \> **Clock out workers**.
    
      - If you want to clock out all the workers in the selected calculation group or approval group, enter the profile date for the clock-out registration and then click **OK**.
    
      - If you want to clock out specific workers, click **Select** and then select the relevant workers.
