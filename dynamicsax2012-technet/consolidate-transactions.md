# Consolidate transactions 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use the consolidation functionality to combine the financial results for several subsidiary companies into results for a single, consolidated company. The subsidiaries can be in the same Microsoft Dynamics AX database or in separate databases.

The accounts for subsidiaries may be recorded in programs other than Microsoft Dynamics AX. To import the financial results for these subsidiaries into results for a consolidated company, you must create comma-delimited export files that contain the correct information.

If the data for subsidiaries is recorded in foreign currencies, you can consolidate financial results in compliance with Regulation 52 of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The GAAP are created and interpreted by the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) and the International Account Standards (IAS).

Depending on the translation method that is required in your country/region, you can select different exchange rates for the various types of ledger accounts in the consolidated company. You can also specify the account in the consolidated company to which exchange differences are posted.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>We recommend that you use Management Reporter for Microsoft Dynamics ERP to combine the financial results for multiple legal entities in a consolidated format. Management Reporter lets you create consolidated financial reports across legal entities, use Microsoft Excel to import consolidation data from other sources, and translate amounts into any number of reporting currencies without having to run the consolidation process in Microsoft Dynamics AX.</P>
> <P>For more information about how to consolidate transactions by using Management Reporter, see <A href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=389548">Financial consolidations and currency translation</A>.</P>
