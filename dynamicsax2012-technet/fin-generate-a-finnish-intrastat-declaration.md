# (FIN) Generate a Finnish Intrastat declaration 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The Intrastat declaration is used to report the movement of goods between European Union (EU) member states. Finnish companies can use the Intrastat form to generate an Intrastat declaration in CSV format for submittal to the Finnish customs authority. For more information, see [About Intrastat](about-intrastat.md).

Before you generate an Intrastat declaration, complete the following tasks:

  - Set up Intrastat parameters to generate Intrastat transaction details and compression details. You can compress export transactions based on commodity code, transaction code, transport, or country/region. Import transactions can be compressed on the basis of commodity, country/region, or country/region of origin. For more information, see [Compress (class form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa590820\(v=ax.60\)), [Compression of Intrastat (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa584795\(v=ax.60\)) and [Foreign trade parameters (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa620385\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Create an item and specify the **Commodity**, **Additional units**, and **Net weight** fields for the Intrastat transaction. For more information, see [Commodity codes (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa617816\(v=ax.60\)).

  - Create an Intrastat service point. For more information, see [(FIN) Intrastat service point (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa600293\(v=ax.60\)) and [Intrastat (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa619055\(v=ax.60\)).
