# About questions 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Questions are required in order to create a complete questionnaire.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Before you can set up questions, you must create answer groups and answers. For more information, see <A href="create-answer-groups-and-answers.md">Create answer groups and answers</A> and <A href="prerequisites-for-questionnaire.md">Prerequisites for questionnaire</A>. For information about how to design questionnaires, see <A href="using-questionnaires.md">Using questionnaires</A> and <A href="designing-questionnaires.md">Designing questionnaires</A>.</P>



Questions can be either open-ended or closed-ended. The responses to open-ended questions are not controlled, and respondents can type their answers.

Closed-ended questions require a list of predefined response options, and a respondent can select one or more responses. Questions should be designed to elicit specific information from a respondent. Closed-ended questions must be linked to an answer group, which provides the response options for each closed-ended question.

Questions can be arranged in a conditional question hierarchy, so that secondary questions are dependent on the answer selected by a respondent for the previous question. Questions can also be written first, and then arranged into a hierarchy later.

## Possible next steps

The following links provide a logical progression to follow in the sequence. Depending on the questionnaire features that you are using, refer to the following information about the next steps:
