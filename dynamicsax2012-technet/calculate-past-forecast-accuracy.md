# Calculate past forecast accuracy 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic describes how to calculate the accuracy of past demand forecasts against past actual demand. In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, forecast accuracy is measured by using these key performance indicators: mean absolute deviation (MAD) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

When you calculate forecast accuracy you define the period during which historical data is collected. You can also select criteria to filter the data. For example, you can filter the data for a particular company or item allocation key. After you’ve calculated the forecast accuracy, view the results in a Microsoft Excel file.

## Prerequisites

The following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you start.

## Calculate past forecast accuracy

To calculate forecast accuracy, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Master planning** \> **Periodic** \> **Demand forecasting** \> **Calculate demand forecast accuracy**.

2.  Complete the following fields.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><p>Field</p></th>
    <th><p>Description</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Forecast bucket</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Select the forecast bucket to use when forecast accuracy is calculated.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Start of historical horizon</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Select the start date of the period during which historical data is collected.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>End of historical horizon</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Select the end date of the period during which historical data is collected.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Excel demand forecast file path</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>This field contains, by default, the location for saving the demand forecast file that is specified in the <strong>Demand forecasting parameters</strong> form, but you can override it. For example, reuse the path but rename the file to ForecastAccuracy.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


3.  In the **Filters** field group, click **Select** to open a query where you can select the filter criteria to apply when the forecast accuracy is calculated. For example, you can calculate the forecast accuracy for a specific item allocation key.
    
    The use of filters also improves performance.

4.  Click **OK** to run the calculation.

## View the demand forecast accuracy sheet in Excel

To view the **Forecast accuracy** in Excel, follow these steps:

1.  Open the demand forecast accuracy file. You can do this in the following ways:
    
      - After you calculate forecast accuracy, and a message informs you that the demand forecast accuracy was calculated, double-click the message or click **Open Excel file**.
    
      - Browse to the location that you specified in the **Excel demand forecast file path** field.

2.  In the Excel file, click **Enable Content**. This enables the content in the **PivotTable** report, so that you can modify it. You only have to do this step the first time that you open the Excel file.

3.  In the **Forecast accuracy** sheet, in the **PivotTable Field List**, select **Released products \> Released product** to display the following columns:
    
      - **Error absolute** – The difference between the historical demand quantity and the adjusted forecast quantity.
    
      - **Forecast error percentage** – The error absolute quantity expressed as a percentage of the adjusted forecast quantity.
