# (POL) Create a free text invoice 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

A free text invoice is an invoice that is not attached to a sales order. A free text invoice contains a header, and one or more lines for items or services that are not tracked in inventory. Use a free text invoice for sales that do not require a sales order or packing slip. For example, you can use a free text invoice for a consulting fee or services fee, or for a miscellaneous fee for an event reimbursement.

For more information about free text invoices, see [Key tasks: Free text invoices](key-tasks-free-text-invoices.md).
