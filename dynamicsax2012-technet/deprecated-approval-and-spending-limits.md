<td><p>Reason for deprecation</p></td>
<td><p>The approval and spending limits feature in AX 2009 did not provide the precise level of control over expenses and approvals that some companies require.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Replaced by another feature</p></td>
<td><p>Yes. The feature has been removed, and a replacement feature is available. The Signing Limits feature in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 provides advanced configuration and administration capabilities, so that companies can enforce corporate spending and approval limits at a more precise level. Additionally, the Signing Limits feature enables spending and approval limit self-service requests to be submitted via the employee self-service portal. Employees can use self-service requests to request a signing limit for business expenses. Managers who approve employee expenses can use self-service requests to request an approval limit. Therefore, this feature automates and simplifies the process for requesting and approving spending and approval limits by using workflow.</p>
