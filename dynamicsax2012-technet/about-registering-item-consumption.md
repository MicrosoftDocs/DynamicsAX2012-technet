# About registering item consumption 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can register consumption of items in **Project management and accounting** in several ways. You can either sell or purchase from a project or reserve items for a project.

## Sales order items

To sell items from a project, you can create a sales order from the project itself. You can only create sales orders from time and material projects.

## Consumption items

You can order items for consumption on a project from the company's inventory, or you can purchase them from an external vendor. Items can be consumed on all types of projects except time projects.

The way in which you order items depends on where you are ordering them from:

  - To order items from the company's inventory, you must enter the order as an item requirement. If you use the **Item requirements** form, you can set it up so that you receive items as partial deliveries. This means that you can postpone consumption of a quantity of the items until the items are required.

  - To order items from an external vendor, you must create the order as a purchase order in the **Purchase order** form.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The packing slip for a project-related sales order cannot be canceled if the items have already been marked for packing.</P>

<li><p>The purchase order is created from an item requirement.</p></li>
</ul></td>
