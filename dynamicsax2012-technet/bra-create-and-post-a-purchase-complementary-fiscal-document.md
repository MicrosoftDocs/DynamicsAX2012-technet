# (BRA) Create and post a purchase complementary fiscal document 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can create a purchase complementary fiscal document to adjust a purchase fiscal document that was generated for an incorrect price, Imposto Sobre Produtos Industrializados (IPI), or Imposto Sobre Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços (ICMS) amount. For more information, see [(BRA) About purchase complementary fiscal documents](bra-about-purchase-complementary-fiscal-documents.md).

You cannot add lines to or delete lines from a purchase complementary fiscal document. You can specify the price or tax adjustment for a specific line. When you post the purchase complementary fiscal document, the adjustment is posted to the fiscal document.
