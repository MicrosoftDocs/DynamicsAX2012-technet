Each company generates an EU sale and purchase list detailing sales and purchase transactions with other European Union states. The list is used for tax authority reporting purposes. According to the VAT Information Exchange System (VIES), each EU member state must collect, store, and process specific information from its exporting companies about their trade with other member states.
