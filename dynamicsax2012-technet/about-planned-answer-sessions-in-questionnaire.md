_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Planned answer sessions are questionnaires that you have designed and selected the respondents for. For more information, see [Using questionnaires](using-questionnaires.md).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Before you can set up planned answer sessions, you must design a questionnaire. For more information, see <A href="distributing-questionnaires.md">Distributing questionnaires</A> and <A href="using-questionnaires.md">Using questionnaires</A>.</P>



In the **Planned answer session** form, you can create a planned answer session for an individual employee. The list in the form displays all planned questionnaires.

Planned answer sessions are also used in the **Questionnaire schedules** form, where you can plan questionnaires for multiple people:

  - Applicants

  - Contact persons

  - Employees

  - Course participants

  - Organizational units

  - Recruitment projects

## Notify a respondent

If you use a planned answer session to plan a questionnaire for an individual respondent, you must notify the person manually, for example, by telephone or by using your default email application.
