# About compliance resources 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When you click **Compliance resources** on the Quick Launch, the contents of the **Compliance resources** folder are displayed.

You can use this folder to store and share information about compliance. For example, you might want to add information about industry-specific compliance regulations that apply to your organization.

A default controls library is automatically included in this folder. You can use the default controls library to help define the control matrix. When the control matrix is complete, you can import it by using the **Import controls** page, or use it as a reference to manually enter the controls by using the **Internal controls** page. You can obtain an updated version of the default controls library by clicking the link in the default controls library file.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The <STRONG>Compliance resources</STRONG> folder is a SharePoint library. Therefore, you can control access to this document library. For more information, see the Microsoft&nbsp;SharePoint documentation.</P>
