## Optional: Set up the parameter to process return transactions during a different shift in the same way that you process return transactions during the same shift

Use this procedure to set up parameters to process return transactions during a different shift in the same way that you process return transactions during the same shift.

To perform this task, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Setup** \> **Parameters** \> **Retail parameters**.

2.  Select the **Process as a return in the same shift** check box to process return transactions during a different shift in the same way that you process return transactions during the same shift.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You must clear the <STRONG>Process as a return in the same shift</STRONG> check box to process return transactions by specifying the disbursement slip number or by automatically creating a disbursement slip at the POS. When you clear this check box, a fiscal receipt is not generated for the return transaction that is performed during a different shift.</P>
