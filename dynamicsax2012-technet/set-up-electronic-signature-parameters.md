# Set up electronic signature parameters 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use this procedure to set up general parameters for electronic signatures.

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Electronic signature** \> **Electronic signature parameters**.

2.  Enter the notice that signers will receive when a signature is requested. You can enter any text. Typically, this text tells the user what it means to sign a document electronically.
    
    Click the **Translations** button to enter notice text in additional languages.

3.  If signers are required to include comments when they provide a signature, select **Require comments**.

4.  Enter a time limit in seconds. If a signature that is required is not provided in the time limit, the **Sign document** form will close, and the tried change will be canceled.

5.  In the **Signature alert recipient** field, select the person who will receive an email alert if the validation process fails for a signature.
