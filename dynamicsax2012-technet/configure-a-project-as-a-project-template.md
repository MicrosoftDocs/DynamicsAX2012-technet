# Configure a project as a project template 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This topic explains how to designate an existing project as a project template. When you create a project by using the Project Copy Wizard, you select a project template. The project template that you select depends on the project structure that you want to replicate. You can replicate a single project, or a parent project with all its subprojects.

When you use the Project Copy Wizard, the structure of this project is available as a project template. However, not all components of the source project can be copied by using the wizard. For example, worker assignments and item requirements are not copied.

For more information about the Project Copy Wizard and the types of data that you can copy to the new projects, see [Project copy wizard (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/aa556743\(v=ax.60\)). For information about how to use the Project Copy Wizard to create a new project, see [Create a project](create-a-project.md).

To designate a project as a template, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Common** \> **Projects** \> **All projects**.

2.  Select or open the project that you want to use as a template.

3.  On the **Project** tab, in the **Maintain** group, click **Edit**.

4.  On the **Project hierarchy** FastTab, select the **Project template** check box.
