# About batch order sequencing 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can use batch order sequencing to define sequences that you can assign to items. A sequence is an item characteristic that is used to sort items in groups so that the items with similar characteristics are scheduled for production together.

You can assign one or multiple sequences to an item. You can prioritize or rank the sequences based on their importance in the sorting sequence. For example, items that are produced in a certain area of the production facility can have many characteristics. It is important to group those items that share a high-level characteristic, such as a known allergen. After the items are sorted by the high-level characteristic, they are then sorted by lower-level characteristics such as color or viscosity.

By using batch order sequencing, you can create a production route for a released product and identify specific resources in the route, where it is very important that production is correctly sequenced to maintain good quality, improve yields, and reduce changeover activities.

You can perform the following tasks for batch order sequencing:

  - Create a batch order sequence and define values for the sequence. For more information, see [Set up product sequences](set-up-product-sequences.md).

  - Create a sequence group and assign sequences to the sequence group. For more information, see [Set up sequence groups](set-up-sequence-groups.md).

  - Assign a sequence and sequence values to an item, item group, or all items. For more information, see [Assign sequence values to an item](assign-sequence-values-to-an-item.md).

  - Assign a sequence group to an operation resource or resource group. For more information, see [Assign a sequence group to an operation resource or resource group](assign-a-sequence-group-to-an-operation-resource-or-resource-group.md).

  - Set up sequencing parameters for a master plan. For more information, see [Set up sequencing parameters for a master plan](set-up-sequencing-parameters-for-a-master-plan.md).

  - Create a production route for a released product. For more information, see [Create a production route for a product](create-a-production-route-for-a-product.md).

  - Run the sequencing operation that sequences planned batch orders that were already generated by master scheduling. For more information, see [Sequence planned batch orders](sequence-planned-batch-orders.md).
