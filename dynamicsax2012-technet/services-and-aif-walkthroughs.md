# Services and AIF Walkthroughs 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

This topic lists and describes documentation that contains walkthroughs of various features of services and Application Integration Framework (AIF) in Microsoft Dynamics AX. You can browse walkthroughs by the type of service, such as system service or document service. Subsections of each service type let you browse walkthroughs in other ways, such as by the type of adapter or the type of document service.

## Document Services

The following sections list walkthroughs for document services.

### By Document Service

The following table lists walkthroughs by the type of document service.

## Custom Services

The following topic contains a walkthrough for custom services:

  - [Walkthrough: Exposing an X++ Class as a Data Contract](walkthrough-exposing-an-x-class-as-a-data-contract.md)

## External Web Services

The following topic contains a walkthrough for how to consume an external web service:

  - [Walkthrough: Calling an External Web Service from X++](walkthrough-calling-an-external-web-service-from-x.md)

## System Services

System services are Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) services that are included with Microsoft Dynamics AX that enable clients to interact with and retrieve system information. This section lists walkthroughs for the three types of system services: the metadata service, the query service, and the user session service.

### Metadata Service

The metadata service returns information about AOT objects in Microsoft Dynamics AX such as tables, services, extended data types (EDTs), enums, and queries. The following table lists walkthroughs that show how to use the metadata service.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
