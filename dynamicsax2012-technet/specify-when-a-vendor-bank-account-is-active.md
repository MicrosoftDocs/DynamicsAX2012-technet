# Specify when a vendor bank account is active 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Vendor bank accounts are used when you pay a vendor electronically. You can modify the active and expiration dates for a vendor bank account to specify when a bank account is available to accept payments. You might modify the dates when a vendor no longer uses a specific bank account, or when a bank account exists but you cannot yet send payments to it.

By default, all bank accounts have blank active and expiration dates, so that they are always active.

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Common** \> **Vendors** \> **All vendors**.

2.  Select the vendor whose bank account you are modifying.

3.  On the Action Pane, on the **Vendor** tab, click **Bank accounts**.

4.  On the **General** FastTab, enter a date in the **Active date** field to specify when the bank account is available to accept payments. Leave the field blank to specify that the bank account is available immediately.

5.  Enter a date in the **Expiration date** field to specify when the bank account is no longer available to accept payments. Leave the field blank to specify that there is no known date when the bank account will no longer accept payments.
