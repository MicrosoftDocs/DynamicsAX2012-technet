# Set up rebates 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

This topic explains how to set up parameters, types, and groups for customer rebates. A rebate is a partial refund of a payment that a customer previously paid for an item or service. Rebates are usually given as part of a promotion or marketing activity. A customer can use a rebate as a deduction on an outstanding balance or take the amount of the rebate as a credit. Rebates are configured so that the appropriate department and promotional category in your organization is billed appropriately for the credit that is returned to the customer.

## 1\. Configure rebate parameters

Use this procedure to configure the default journal information for rebates that are offered by your organization.

1.  Click **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Accounts receivable parameters**.

2.  In the **Accounts receivable parameters** form, in the left pane, click **Rebate program**.

3.  To create a customer rebate when the customer order is invoiced, select the **At invoicing** check box.

4.  In the **AR consumption journal** field, select the journal that will be used to post a credit note for the rebate amount in the name of the customer who will receive the rebate.

5.  In the **AP invoice journal** field, select the accounts payable journal to which rebates will be posted, and in the **Terms of payment** field, select the payment code that represents how rebates will be paid to vendors. In this situation, the customer is a vendor who is receiving the rebate. A vendor account must be created for the customer so that they can receive rebate payments.

6.  In the **Rebate accrual journal** field, select the journal to post accruals to when a rebate claim is processed. When the rebate is transferred to a customer or vendor account, the interim account to which the rebate was posted is cleared.

7.  In the **Trade spending journal** field, select the journal to use when posting trade allowance management type rebates.

8.  In the **Freight journal** field, select the journal to use when posting freight type rebates.

9.  If rebates are cumulated on a weekly basis, in the **Starting day of week** field, select the day of the week on which rebates should be cumulated.

## 2\. Set up rebate types

Use the procedure to set up types of rebates that can then be applied to a rebate program.

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Setup** \> **Rebate program** \> **Rebate program types**.

2.  In the **Rebate program types** form, click **New**.

3.  Enter the ID and a brief description of the rebate type.

4.  In the **Rebate program type** field, select the rebate type.

5.  In the **Default accrual account** field, select the main account to which accrued rebate amounts will be posted.

6.  In the **Default expense account** field, select the main account to which the expenses that are related to rebate claims will be posted.

7.  Repeat steps 2 through 6 to set up more rebate types.

## 3\. Set up customer rebate groups

Use this procedure to create customer rebate groups. After you set up the customer rebate groups, customers can be associated with a group. Next, you can define the rebate agreements for these groups.

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Setup** \> **Rebate program** \> **Customer** \> **Customer rebate groups**.

2.  In the **Customer rebate groups** form, click **New**.

3.  Enter a name and a brief description for the customer rebate group.

## 4\. Set up item rebate groups

Use this procedure to create item rebate groups. After you set up the rebate groups, items can be associated with a group. Next, you can define the rebate agreements for these groups.

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Setup** \> **Rebate program** \> **Item** \> **Item rebate groups**.

2.  In the **Item rebate groups** form, click **New**.

3.  Enter a name and a brief description for the item rebate group.
