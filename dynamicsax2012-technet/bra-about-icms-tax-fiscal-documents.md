# (BRA) About ICMS tax fiscal documents 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can use Imposto sobre Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços (ICMS) tax fiscal documents to transfer ICMS tax amounts between fiscal establishments by issuing a nota fiscal elêtronica (NF-e), and recover the ICMS tax amount in installments for the purchase of fixed assets.

You can do the following:

  - Create and post an ICMS tax fiscal document to transfer the ICMS tax amount to a customer or vendor, or recover the ICMS tax amount in installments for the purchase of fixed assets by a legal entity.

  - Add fiscal document text to an ICMS tax fiscal document.

  - View the voucher transactions that are related to an ICMS tax fiscal document in the **Voucher transactions** form.

  - Cancel a posted ICMS tax fiscal document and generate a canceled voucher transaction. The canceled voucher transaction is created with an invoice amount that is the same as that of the original invoice, but the invoice amount is negative.

  - Post the canceled invoice, and view the original and canceled voucher transactions in the **Voucher transactions** form.

  - Print an ICMS tax fiscal document from the **General ledger** module. The footer text that you set up in the **Print management setup** form is not printed in ICMS tax fiscal documents.
