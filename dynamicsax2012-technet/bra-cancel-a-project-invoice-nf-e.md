# (BRA) Cancel a project invoice NF-e 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use this procedure to cancel a project Nota Fiscal eletrÃ´nica (NF-e). You can cancel a project NF-e that is incorrect.

You can cancel the NF-e before you submit it to the Secretaria da Fazenda (SEFAZ). Alternatively, you can cancel the NF-e after it is approved by SEFAZ. SEFAZ must approve the cancellation for a project NF-e that has been processed or approved.

1.  Click **Project management and accounting** \> **Common** \> **Projects** \> **All projects**. Select a project, and then, on the **Action Pane**, on the **Project** tab, in the **Maintain** group, click **Edit**. Alternatively, in the **All projects** list, double-click a project line.

2.  On the **Manage** tab, click **Invoice journals**.

3.  Select a project invoice, and then click **Invoice cancellation**.

4.  Click **Yes** to open the **Invoice cancellation** form.

5.  In the **Reason code** field, select the reason code for the invoice cancellation.

6.  In the **Comments** field, enter any additional details about the invoice cancellation. The comments in this field are sent as the reason for NF-e cancellation.

7.  In the **Canceling invoice date** field, select the date of the invoice cancellation.

8.  Click **Cancel project invoice** to open the **Invoice posting** form.

9.  Click **OK** to cancel the invoice.
