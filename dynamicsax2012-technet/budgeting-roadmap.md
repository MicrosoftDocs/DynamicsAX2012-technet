# Budgeting roadmap 


This topic is a roadmap to additional information about Budgeting in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. It includes links to information about how to get started, configure, and use Budgeting, and which modules integrate with Budgeting.

You can use Budgeting to set up, create, and view budgets. Budgeting can include budget control, which you can use to monitor the budget funds that are available for planned and actual purchases and expenditures. You can create budget register entries for the original budget, budget transfers, and budget revisions. You can also create budget register entries for encumbrances and pre-encumbrances for purchases and planned expenditures. Budget register entries can be created automatically when budgets are transferred to the general ledger from other modules, such as Project management and accounting or Fixed assets.

You can determine which financial dimensions from the chart of accounts are available for basic budgeting and budget control. When you configure budget control, you define budget intervals, budget cycle time spans, budget thresholds, budget managers, budget groups, and the calculation that is used to check for available budget funds. The available budget funds can be verified when source documents and accounting journals are entered. You can view the status and history of budget register entries, budget control statistics, actual versus budgeted amounts, budget details, and budget funds available.

In Budgeting, you can configure and set up budget planning processes based on the budget cycles and ledger for your organization. The budget planning processes contain stages and workflows that automatically route budget plans for review and approvals. You can compare and analyze the budget plans that contain data in multiple scenarios, so that you can develop and adopt optimal budget proposals that work well for your organization.
