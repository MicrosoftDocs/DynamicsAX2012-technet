_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic includes information about features that were added or changed for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2. This information also applies to AX 2012 R3. See the section later in this topic.</P>



Expense categories in **Travel and expense** can be integrated with the expense categories in **Project management and accounting**. When you create expense categories in **Travel and expense**, you can mark them as categories that can be used to track expenses in **Project management and accounting**. After you select this option, the categories become available in the list of project categories.

You can also create a category in **Project management and accounting** and include it in the **Travel and expense** categories or the **Production control** categories. Expense categories that you create in **Project management and accounting** can be applied only to expense transactions.

## New or changed for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2

You can activate or inactivate an expense category even if the expense category is used on an expense report. You can also inactivate the subcategories of an expense category but keep the expense category active.
