# What's new: Country-specific features for Brazil (BRA) 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, we changed and added country-specific functionality for Brazil. This topic is divided into two sections. The first section outlines the key features that have a broad impact on Brazilian installations, such as features that support fiscal establishments, fiscal documents, and specific requirements for regulatory reporting. The second section describes additional changes to country-specific functionality for Brazil. For more information about specific features for Brazil, see [TechNet Library for Application Users - Brazil](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=299904).

## New functionality

Country/region-specific features are now enabled for organizations that have some of or all their operations based in Brazil. These features are implicitly enabled when you install AX 2012 R2 and then set up a legal entity that has an address in Brazil.

## Comparison with Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009

Features for Brazil have changed considerably since AX 2009. Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 includes new functionality for fiscal establishments and fiscal documents.

<td><p>Updates to Fiscal operation codes for Brazil</p></td>
<td><p>The Códigos Fiscais de Operações E Prestações (CFOP) codes now include a direction (incoming or outgoing) and a purpose (return, shipment, or fiscal establishment transfer). The CFOP matrix lets you determine the CFOP codes that are used in each transaction, and new transaction types were added:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Free text invoice</strong> – CFOP codes that can be used in free text invoices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Item requirement</strong> – CFOP codes that can be used in project item requirement forms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Third party transfer</strong> – CFOP codes that can be used for shipments of items to customers or vendors, or receipts of items from customers or vendors, in transfer orders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fiscal establishment transfer</strong> – CFOP codes that can be used for transfers between fiscal establishments in transfer orders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tax fiscal document</strong> – CFOP codes that can be used for tax fiscal document transactions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the earlier transaction types are still valid:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sales</strong> – CFOP codes that can be used in sales orders and sales quotations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Purchase</strong> – CFOP codes that can be used in purchase orders, purchase quotations, purchase requisitions, and vendor invoices.</p></li>

<td><p>Use fiscal establishments to post sales and purchases for Brazil.</p></td>
<td><p>A fiscal establishment is a physical location of a legal entity. A fiscal establishment requires tax registration numbers (CNPJ or IE), issues and receives legal documentation, and assesses or pays taxes. Because a legal entity can have multiple fiscal establishments, each fiscal establishment is now required to issue and receive fiscal documents in processes that involve sales orders, sales returns, purchase orders, purchase returns, free text invoices, transfer orders, and tax fiscal documents.</p>
<p>In processes that involve sales orders, sales returns, purchase orders, purchase returns, and transfer orders, the fiscal establishment is determined by a relation that is defined between the fiscal establishment and the site.</p>
<p>In processes that involve free text invoices and tax fiscal documents, the fiscal establishment has to be determined by the user before fiscal document posting.</p>

<td><p>You can create and post a purchase invoice by specifying the CFOP codes. You must specify CFOP codes for a purchase order, a returned item, or an item that has a product type of <strong>Item</strong>. You can also specify the fiscal document type for a return purchase order.</p>
<p>You can also perform the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Set up the fiscal document text for a purchase order or a vendor invoice.</p></li>
<li><p>Create reference invoices that link one or more vendor invoice references when an invoice is created.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate, post, and print the vendor invoice from a non-taxpayer vendor, and then post the purchase invoice.</p></li>

<td><p>Check payments and Bordero payments for Brazil</p></td>
<td><p>You can use a check or the Bordero method of payment to make vendor payments. The check or Bordero payment is generated by Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). When you use a check, you can post and print one check per bank or vendor. The check is issued in the name of the bank or the vendor. When you use the Bordero method of payment, you can post and print one Bordero payment per bank. You can also generate the Bordero report for a bank.</p>
<p>You can reverse a check or Bordero payment. When you reverse a payment, the transaction is canceled, and the related vendor invoices are available for settlement. If taxes were withheld from the check or Bordero payment, the withholding taxes are also reversed.</p>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Brazilian fiscal documents for the direct delivery process</p></td>
<td><p>You can now relate taxes with fiscal values 1 and 3 by setting a delivery item sales tax group and a delivery sales tax group for the sales order when a CFOP has an associated delivery CFOP that allows a delivery slip to be used together with the Nota fiscal eletrônica (NF-e) feature when a delivery slip fiscal document is posted.</p>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Fiscal document texts</p></td>
<td><p>Brazilian law requires that you print text for some transactions. Legal text is a short message that is printed on fiscal documents and the Documento Auxiliar da Nota fiscal eletrônica (DANFE). Legal text provides additional information for a fiscal document, such as the fiscal purpose of the document or complementary information about the fiscal document.</p>
<p>You can now set up master data for legal text, and link that data to the CFOP, vendor, customer, item, sales order, or purchase order. You can set legal text so that it is printed automatically on fiscal documents and DANFE. Legal text is also sent to Sistema Publico de Escrituração Digital (SPED).</p>

<td><p>Withholding tax for Brazil</p></td>
<td><p>Withholding tax can now be determined by fiscal document line. Therefore, the process now resembles the process for determining taxes.</p>
<p>You can specify a withholding tax group for customers and vendors. You can also specify an item withholding tax group that is used by default for items on sales order and purchase order lines, but that can be modified.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="bra-set-up-a-withholding-tax.md">(BRA) Set up a withholding tax</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Updates to Sales and purchase operation types in Brazil</p></td>
<td><p>Companies in Brazil follow a different process for posting purchase orders and sales orders when there is no inventory movement or related customer/vendor transaction. You implement this process by configuring the purchase and sales operation types in the <strong>Operation type</strong> form. The operation types control the process of sales and purchase postings while you perform the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create inventory movements.</p></li>
<li><p>Create customer/vendor transactions.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify posting account numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify customer/vendor posting profiles</p></li>

<p>For more information, see <a href="bra-set-up-operation-types.md">(BRA) Set up operation types</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Enhancements for Brazilian tax calculations</p></td>
<td><p>You can set up taxation codes based on the validity period that is specified by the government. Multiple fiscal values can be specified for one taxation code. When the taxation code is selected for the sales tax code and the item sales tax group, the correct taxation code and fiscal value should be selected.</p>
<p>The following new tax types were added:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>ICMS-ST</strong> – This tax type determines tributary substitution of Imposto Sobre Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços (ICMS).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ICMS-DIF</strong> – This tax type determines whether a purchase has a differential rate in an interstate purchase of ICMS.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For ICMS-ST Tax types, you can select a tributary substitution method of either <strong>Markup</strong> or <strong>Simplified</strong> to calculate the tributary substitution. Tax substitution is the collection of sales tax at the first point of sale, where the markup tax rate is estimated by the fiscal authorities. This is done to expedite the collection of taxes.</p>
<div class="alert">

> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can no longer change the taxation code or fiscal value on sales order and purchase order lines.</P>

<td><p>Complementary invoices</p></td>
<td><p>You must create a complementary invoice or nota fiscal complementar to adjust a fiscal document that was generated for an incorrect price, Imposto Sobre Produtos Industrializados (IPI), or ICMS amount. A complementary invoice is issued only to adjust a positive difference. For example, a complementary invoice is generated if the price of an item on the original invoice is incorrect, and the correct price for the item is higher than the price that is recorded on the original invoice. You can create a complementary invoice to adjust errors in the price or quantity of goods or services, in the tax percentage, or in the tax calculation. The complementary invoice is a fiscal document that complements the original fiscal document. All information except miscellaneous charges is updated from the original fiscal document. You cannot add or delete lines from a complementary invoice.</p>
