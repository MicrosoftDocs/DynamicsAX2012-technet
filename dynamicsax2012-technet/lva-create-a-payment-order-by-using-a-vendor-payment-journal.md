You must also create a payment specification code for the method of payment that you selected in the **Methods of payment - vendors** form. For more information, see [Vendor payment specification (form)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa554108\(v=ax.60\)).

4.  In the **Debit** field, enter a debit amount in the currency that is selected for the journal line.
