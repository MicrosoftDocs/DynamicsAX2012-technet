This topic explains how to change a tender declaration after you have entered opening or closing amounts on a register. For example, a register’s opening amounts may have been entered incorrectly.

## Change a tender declaration

    The denomination of the coin or note is displayed in the **Amount in transaction currency** field.

5.  In the **Quantity** field, enter the new amount of coins or notes.

6.  Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each coin or note whose quantity you want to change.
    
    The results of your changes appear in the **Total** field.

7.  When you’re finished making changes, click **Close**.
