[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use this procedure to review the details of a packing slip for a fixed asset transfer and to print the transfer packing slip. If your organization moves a fixed asset from one department to another and the two departments are not in the same location, the transfer must be verified by a packing slip. You must also generate a transfer packing slip if the employee who is responsible for the fixed asset changes.

1.  Click **Fixed assets** \> **Inquiries** \> **Packing slips**.

2.  In the left pane, select a packing slip, and then review the details of the packing slip.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>You create packing slips in the <STRONG>Fixed asset transfer</STRONG> form. For more information, see <A href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn126117(v=ax.60)">(LTU) Fixed asset transfer (modified form)</A>.</P>



3.  To add or change information, click **Transportation details**.

4.  In the **Transportation details** form, add or change information as appropriate, and then close the **Transportation details** form.

5.  When the information in the **Packing slip details** form is correct, click **Fixed asset packing slip**.

6.  In the **Fixed asset packing slip** form, select print options, and then click **OK** to print the packing slip.
