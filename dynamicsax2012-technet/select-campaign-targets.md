# Select campaign targets 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You select campaign targets in the **Contact details** form. Therefore, the recipients of a campaign must be registered in the **Contact details** form.

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Common** \> **Campaigns** \> **All campaigns**. Select the campaign for which you want to define targets, and then click **Edit**.

2.  Click the **Targets** FastTab, and then select **Select targets**.

3.  Click CTRL+N to create a new line.

4.  In the **Query name** field, enter a unique name for the query.

5.  In the **Class description** field, select a relevant job description for the query.

6.  Click **Run query** to modify the active query.

7.  Close the forms to save your changes.
