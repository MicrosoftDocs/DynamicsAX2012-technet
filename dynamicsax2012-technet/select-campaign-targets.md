2.  Click the **Targets** FastTab, and then select **Select targets**.

3.  Click CTRL+N to create a new line.

4.  In the **Query name** field, enter a unique name for the query.

5.  In the **Class description** field, select a relevant job description for the query.

6.  Click **Run query** to modify the active query.

7.  Close the forms to save your changes.
