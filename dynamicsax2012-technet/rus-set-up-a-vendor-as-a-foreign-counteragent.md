# (RUS) Set up a vendor as a foreign counteragent [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use the **Vendors** form to set up a vendor as a foreign counteragent, so that the vendor can transfer goods that must be imported. The vendor must be set up as a foreign counteragent before you can create a customs journal for the import operation.

1.  Click **Accounts payable** \> **Common** \> **Vendors** \> **All vendors**.

2.  On the **Action Pane**, in the **New** action group, click **Vendor** to create a vendor account, or double-click an existing vendor account.

3.  On the **General** FastTab, select the **Foreign counteragent** check box to indicate that the vendor is a foreign counteragent.
