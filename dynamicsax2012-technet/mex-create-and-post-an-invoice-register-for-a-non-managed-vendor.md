A non-managed vendor is a vendor with whom the company does not maintain an ongoing business relationship.

4.  In the **Account** field, select the vendor account.

5.  In the **Invoice** field, enter the vendor invoice number.

6.  In the **Debit** field, enter the amount to be paid.

7.  In the **Approved by** field, select the ID code of the employee who will approve the invoice line.

8.  Click the **General** tab and in the **Type of operation** field, select the operation type for the vendor for the DeclaraciÃ³n Informativa de Operaciones con Terceros (DIOT).
