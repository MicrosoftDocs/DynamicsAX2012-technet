_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

For example, the **In** status displays the number of items received through a purchase order, production order, transfer order, physical count, and other receipt transactions. The **Out** status displays the number of items issued through a sales order, production order, transfer order, physical count, and other issue transactions.
