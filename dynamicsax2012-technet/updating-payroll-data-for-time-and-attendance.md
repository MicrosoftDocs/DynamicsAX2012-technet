# Updating payroll data for time and attendance 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In **Time and attendance**, payroll data that has been generated based on worker registrations can be transferred to a payroll file. It is also possible to recalculate balances that relate to payroll calculation.

## Transfer payroll data

You can transfer payroll data to an external file so that a payroll system can use the data. You define the file name and format for the external file. The transfer is executed based on a **Pay period**, and it will only contain data for the workers who are connected to the selected **Pay period**.

Click **Human resources** \> **Periodic** \> **Time and attendance** \> **Payroll** \> **Transfer to pay**.

## Recalculate worker balances for count units

You can recalculate the balance of count units for selected workers.

If you change the setup of a count unit, recalculate the worker balances for count units. Click **Human resources** \> **Periodic** \> **Time and attendance** \> **Payroll** \> **Recalculate worker balances**.

## Recalculate payroll statistics

If you change the setup of a payroll statistic, recalculate the worker balances for the statistic. Click **Human resources** \> **Periodic** \> **Time and attendance** \> **Payroll** \> **Recalculate payroll statistics**.
