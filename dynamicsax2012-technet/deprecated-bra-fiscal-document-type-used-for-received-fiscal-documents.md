# Deprecated: (BRA) Fiscal document type used for received fiscal documents 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009 for Brazilian installations, a fiscal document type is required to receive a fiscal document. Foundation changes in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 changed the functionality for the receipt of fiscal documents. Therefore, the country-specific feature is not required.
