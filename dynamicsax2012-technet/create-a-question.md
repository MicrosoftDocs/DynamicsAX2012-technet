# Create a question 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Use the **Questions** form to create questions for a questionnaire.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Before you can set up questions, you must specify prerequisites for questionnaires and create answers. For more information, see <A href="prerequisites-for-questionnaire.md">Prerequisites for questionnaire</A> and <A href="using-answers-and-questions-for-questionnaire.md">Using answers and questions for questionnaire</A>.</P>



Depending on your selection in the **Input type** list, you can create two kinds of questions:

  - **Closed-ended questions** – Respondents can select from a predefined list of answers. For example, closed-ended questions should require specific facts. When you create closed-ended questions, click the **Alternative button**, or select **Check box** or **Combo box**. To allow respondents to select more than one answer, select the **Check box** input type.

  - **Open-ended questions** – Respondents enter their answers, which cannot be predefined in a list, such as text, a number, a date, or a time. For example, an open-ended question might ask for an opinion.

<!-- end list -->

1.  Click **Home** \> **Common** \> **Questionnaires** \> **Design** \> **Questions**.

2.  Click **New** to create a new line.

3.  In the **Type** field, select the type of questionnaire for the question.

4.  In the **Input type** field, select the input option that best suits the question.

5.  In the **Text** field, type the question text, and also include punctuation.
    
    If the question requires more than one line, you can also type the question in the **Text** field on the **Text** tab.

6.  In the **Answer group** field, select the group of answers to use.
    
    Answer groups are relevant only when you use closed-ended questions.

7.  On the **Text** tab, you can add instructions to clarify the question.
    
    During an answer session, the instructions are displayed with the question to help users.
