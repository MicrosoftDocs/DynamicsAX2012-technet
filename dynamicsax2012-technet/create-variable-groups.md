# Create variable groups [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Variable groups are useful for grouping modeling variables in the user dialog box. In other words, you can use them to control the appearance of the user dialog box.

If an item requires many modeling variables, it might be a good idea to create several variable groups and use them to divide the modeling variables into logical sections and subsections. This procedure enables you to present the product model’s modeling variables to the user in an organized way—that is, as tab pages and field groups or as folders and subfolders, depending on the setup in the **Product builder parameters** form.

1.  Click **Product information management** \> **Setup** \> **Product builder** \> **Groups** \> **Variable group**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a new line.

3.  Type a unique name for the variable group in the **Variable group** field.

4.  Type its description in the **Description** field.
