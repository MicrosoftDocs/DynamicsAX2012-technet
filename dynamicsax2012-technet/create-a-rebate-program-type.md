Use this procedure to create a rebate program type. You use rebate program types with rebate agreements.

1.  Click **Sales and marketing** \> **Setup** \> **Rebate program** \> **Rebate program types**.

2.  Press CTRL+N to create a new rebate program type.

3.  In the **Rebate program ID** field, enter a unique name or identifier for the rebate program type.

4.  In the **Rebate program type** field, select the program type:
    
      - **Rebate** ─ This rebate type is typically processed by sending a check to the customer or by deducting the rebate amount from the customer's invoice.
    
      -  **Freight** ─ Freight rebates accrue based on region and are not passed to the customer. They are used only for reporting.
    
      - **TMA** ─ Trade & Merchandising Allowance (TMA) rebates accrue until they are passed on to the customer, which is usually by credit note.

5.  In the **Default accrual account** field, select the account to use to accrue rebates to be paid to the customer.

6.  In the **Default expense account** field, select the account to use for disbursing rebate payments to customers.
