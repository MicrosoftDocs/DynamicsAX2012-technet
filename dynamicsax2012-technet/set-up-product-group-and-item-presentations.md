# Set up product group and item presentations 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In the **Presentations** form, you can add descriptive text and an image for each product group. You can also add a description and an image for specific items. Both product groups and items are presented together with images, headings, and additional information.

When a customer clicks a product group in Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX, a list of the product items in that group is displayed. The text and image for the product group are displayed above the list of product items. When a customer clicks a product item, the product is presented together with a picture, summary, and product description.
