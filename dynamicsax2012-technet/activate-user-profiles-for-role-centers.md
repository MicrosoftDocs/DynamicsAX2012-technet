# Activate user profiles for Role Centers 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Default user profiles are available for various roles in the organization, such as chief financial officer and accounting manager. These profiles contain role-specific information, and determine the content that is displayed on Role Center pages. You must select the profiles that you want to use in your Microsoft Dynamics AX system.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> <P>For this release, default user profiles are not associated with default security roles. Selecting user profiles will not affect the security roles that are available.</P>



After you import user profiles, you must do the following:

  - Install Enterprise Portal, if it is not already installed.

  - Configure Role Centers. For more information, see [Checklist: Configure Role Centers](checklist-configure-role-centers.md).
