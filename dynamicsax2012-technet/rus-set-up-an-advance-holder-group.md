2.  Press CTRL+N.

3.  In the **Group** field, enter the code for the new group.

4.  In the **Description** field, enter the description of the advance holder group.

5.  In the **Offset account** field, select the general ledger offset account to be used for the advance holder group.

6.  Press CTRL+S or close the form.
