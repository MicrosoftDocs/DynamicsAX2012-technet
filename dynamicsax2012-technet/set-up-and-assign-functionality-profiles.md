# Set up and assign functionality profiles 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack_

Use a functionality profile to configure the point of sale (POS) functionality for all registers in a store. The settings in a functionality profile put limits on staff logons, specify information about secondary currencies, control the aggregation of products and payments, specify reason codes, enable X and Z reports, and so on.

After the functionality profile is set up, you can assign it to one or more stores.
