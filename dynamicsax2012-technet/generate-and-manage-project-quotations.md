# Generate and manage project quotations 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

As the initial step in the project phase, you can use project quotations to approach a customer with an attractive, binding offer.

A project quotation might encompass elements such as the items and services that are quoted, basic contact information, special trade agreements and discounts, and possible taxes and surcharges.

Your ability to monitor, review, and control the pipeline of project quotations and orders is an important part of project management. Various tools in Microsoft Dynamics AX can help with these tasks. Tools such as correct reference data definitions (quotation types, quotation origin, and prognosis and probability) help you analyze the pipeline. You can use these tools to categorize the reasons why a project quotation was won or lost and determine the possible value of the quotation.

You can view most of this data in various outputs such as reports or statistics in the **Project management and accounting** module.
