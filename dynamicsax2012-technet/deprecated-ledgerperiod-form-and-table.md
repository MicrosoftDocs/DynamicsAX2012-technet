# Deprecated: LedgerPeriod form and table 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, the LedgerPeriod table and form are used to create and maintain the fiscal periods for a company.

## Overview

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Reason for deprecation</p></td>
<td><p>Global organizations operate as different legal entities in different geographical areas. However, they share a lot of data, such as charts of accounts, currencies, exchange rates, and calendars. Defining this reference and master data once and sharing it across legal entities reduces the cost of maintaining such data across the organization. However, ledger periods, and the associated AssetCalendar tables, did not provide sufficient support for this scenario and have been replaced with more robust shared fiscal calendars. The following tables have been deprecated:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AssetCalendar</p></li>
<li><p>AssetCalendarPeriod</p></li>
<li><p>AssetCalendarYear</p></li>
<li><p>LedgerPeriod</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Replaced by another feature</p></td>
<td><p>Yes. The feature is no longer available and has been replaced with shared fiscal calendars.</p>
