# (BRA) Set up fiscal books parameters per state 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can enter adjustments for Imposto sobre Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços (ICMS) taxes that have been applied in the period that is covered by a Sistema Publico de Escrituração Digital (SPED) fiscal text file. Each state defines whether the adjustments can be made to tax amounts in general, or to tax amounts on fiscal documents. For example, Sao Paulo allows general adjustments, while Rio de Janeiro allows both general adjustments and adjustments to fiscal documents.

This topic explains how to specify default adjustment codes and CIAP options for each state by using the **Fiscal books parameters per state** form. An adjustment is automatically made for the tax assessment for the amount of the ICMS differential. This adjustment is made for a fiscal document or in general, depending on the requirements of the state.

For information about how to enter ICMS and ICMS tributary substitution (ICMS-ST) tax adjustment transactions, see [(BRA) Assess, pay, declare, and adjust ICMS and ICMS-ST taxes](bra-assess-pay-declare-and-adjust-icms-and-icms-st-taxes.md). For information about how to work with Controle de Crédito de ICMS do Ativo Permanente (CIAP) fixed assets, see [(BRA) Working with fiscal books for fixed assets](bra-working-with-fiscal-books-for-fixed-assets.md).
