# (BRA) Post a payment with the Bordero method of payment and generate the Bordero report 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Bordero is a method of payment that is used to generate a batch of vendor payments and print them on the Bordero report. The Bordero report is sent to the bank that is responsible for paying the bills that are listed on the Bordero report.

When you post the payment journal that uses the Bordero method of payment, the following events occur:

  - The posting levels that are defined for the journal in the **Detail level** field on the **General** tab in the **Payment journal** form, or in the **Detail level** field in the **Journal names** form, do not apply to the payment journal.

  - The posting level for the method of payment that uses the Bordero export format that is specified in the **Posting level** field in the **Methods of payment - vendors** form applies to the journal. For more information, see [(BRA) Set up a check or Bordero method of payment for a vendor](bra-set-up-a-check-or-bordero-method-of-payment-for-a-vendor.md).

All the payment lines in the payment journal that uses the Bordero method of payment are grouped by bank and updated with the same Bordero number. You must select **One voucher number only** in the **New voucher** field in the **Journal names** form to assign one voucher number to all the payment lines.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You must assign a continuous number sequence for Bordero payments before you can generate a Bordero payment. For more information, see <A href="bra-set-up-a-number-sequence-for-bordero-payments.md">(BRA) Set up a number sequence for Bordero payments</A>.</P>
