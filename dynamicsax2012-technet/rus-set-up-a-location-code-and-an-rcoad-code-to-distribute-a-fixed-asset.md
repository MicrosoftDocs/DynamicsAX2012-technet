# (RUS) Set up a location code and an RCOAD code to distribute a fixed asset 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

Use the **Distribution** form to set up a location code and a Russian Classification of Objects and Administrative Division (RCOAD) code. The location code and RCOAD code are used to distribute a fixed asset to a location that has an RCOAD code that differs from the RCOAD code of the head office or a separate company division. An RCOAD code is a legislative or territorial code that is defined for each region or territory of the Russian Federation. The location code is based on the location that the fixed asset is distributed to. You can distribute a fixed asset that is located in one location to other locations, such as the head office or another company division.

1.  Click **Fixed assets (Russia)** \> **Setup** \> **Tax reporting** \> **Distribution**.

2.  Click **New** to create a location code.

3.  In the **Territory** field, enter the location code of the location to which the fixed asset is distributed.

4.  In the **RCOAD** field, enter the RCOAD code for the fixed asset.

5.  In the **Sales tax code** field, select the sales tax code to use to post sales tax for the fixed asset.
