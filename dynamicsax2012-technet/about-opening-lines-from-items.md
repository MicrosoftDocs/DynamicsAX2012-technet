# About opening lines from items 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can view the bill of material (BOM) versions and their related BOM lines.

View the bill of materials (BOM) versions that are associated with the item in the Item form. You can link new BOM versions and edit existing ones. In addition to the **BOM number** and **Name**, the window shows the date interval for which the version is valid. A check in the **Active** field indicates that the BOM is active. A check in the **Approved** field indicates that the BOM has been approved. The **Approved by** field shows who approved it. You can mark more than one BOM version as active, if the valid periods do not overlap.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>To create a new BOM, click <STRONG>Create BOM</STRONG>.</P>



You can view the BOM lines that make up the BOM. You can create and modify the lines. You must specify the **Item number**, **Quantity**, and a sales unit. Remember that a BOM might be associated with more than one BOM item, which means that changes here might affect other BOM items. In the **BOM** form, you can see which BOM items are associated with a BOM.
