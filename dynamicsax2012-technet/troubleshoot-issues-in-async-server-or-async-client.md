# Troubleshoot issues in Async Server or Async Client 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

Use the information in this topic to troubleshoot issues with Commerce Data Exchange: Async Server or Commerce Data Exchange: Async Client.

## Test connections

Use the Async Client Configuration Tool to test connections between Async Client and other components.

1.  Start the Async Client Configuration Tool. By default, the executable file is located at C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Dynamics AX\\60\\CDX\\Async Client\\\<DatabaseName\>\_Package. Double-click the **AsyncClientConfigurationUtility.exe** file.

2.  Test connections to other components, as shown in the following table.
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><p>Async Client connection</p></th>
    <th><p>How to verify the connection</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>Async Server</p></td>
    <td><p>On the <strong>Async Server connection</strong> tab, in the <strong>Authentication information</strong> section, click <strong>Test connection</strong>.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p>Channel message database</p></td>
    <td><p>On the <strong>Channel configuration</strong> tab, in the <strong>Channel message database</strong> section, click <strong>Test connection</strong>.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>Channel database</p></td>
    <td><p>On the <strong>Channel configuration</strong> tab, in the <strong>Channel database</strong> section, click <strong>Test connection</strong>.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


## Troubleshoot connectivity issues

If connection tests for Async Client are not successful, we recommend that you verify the following information.

  - Verify that the URL to Async Server is correct. Double-check the server name, web site name, port number, and protocol that are used.

  - Verify that the channel database ID is correct in the Async Client configuration. The value that you set for the channel database ID must match the value that is set in the **Channel database** form in Microsoft Dynamics AX.

  - Verify the user name and password for the connection to Async Server. The user name and password must match the values that were set in the **Channel database** form in Microsoft Dynamics AX.

  - Run the **Sync metadata** process in the **Retail scheduler parameters** form. This process synchronizes configuration data for Commerce Data Exchange with the message database at headquarters.

  - Make sure that initial data has been distributed to the channel database. In the **Channel database** form, click **Full data sync** and then select the distribution schedule that is named **Full sync**.

  - On the location computer, verify that remote connections to Microsoft SQL Server are enabled, and that SQL Server users and permissions are set up correctly. For more information about these requirements, see [Configure SQL Server for the Retail databases](configure-sql-server-for-the-retail-databases.md).

  - Use ping, Telnet, or another network utility to verify that the location computer can connect to the Microsoft Dynamics AX computer at the head office. If it cannot, make sure that the firewall at headquarters is open to the required ports or programs. If the firewall is already open, work with the network administrator to correct the network configuration.
