# (RUS) About worker table numbers for advance holders 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

A worker can be an employee or a contractor, and can hold several positions in an organization. An employee or a contractor can also be an advance holder who is accountable for the expense amount that is provided by the organization. To specify a worker as an advance holder, you must enter a unique worker ID in the **Worker ID** field in the **Worker** form. You must also select the **Advance holder** check box in the **Advance holders** form to indicate that the selected worker is an advance holder.

Transactions for these workers can be posted by using advance holder accounts. The worker ID that is specified for each advance holder can be used to track all advance holder transactions. This number is retrieved as an account number for advance holder transactions in the **General journals** and **Advance holder transactions** forms.
