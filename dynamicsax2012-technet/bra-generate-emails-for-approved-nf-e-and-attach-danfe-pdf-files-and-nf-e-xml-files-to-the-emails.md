# (BRA) Generate emails for approved NF-e and attach DANFE PDF files and NF-e XML files to the emails 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

You can generate the Documento Auxiliar da Nota Fiscal Eletrônica (DANFE) for a Nota Fiscal eletrônica (NF-e) as a PDF file. You can then send the DANFE PDF file and the NF-e XML file that are generated for an approved NF-e to a third-party customer or vendor via email. You must set up an email template before you can generate emails for approved electronic fiscal documents. For more information, see [(BRA) Set up email parameters and email templates for an NF-e](bra-set-up-email-parameters-and-email-templates-for-an-nf-e.md).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This topic does not apply to versions of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 prior to cumulative update 7 for AX 2012 R2.</P>
