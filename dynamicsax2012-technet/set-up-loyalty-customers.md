To set up customers for your loyalty program, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Retail** \> **Common** \> **Loyalty** \> **Loyalty customers**.

2.  On the **Loyalty customer** list page, on the **Action Pane**, in the **New** group, click **Loyalty customer** to create a new loyalty customer.
    
    Retail generates a new loyalty card number if an automatic number sequence is set up.

3.  On the **Loyalty customer** FastTab, in the **Customer account** field, select a customer account for the loyalty customer.

4.  Click in another field. Retail automatically enters information about the customer in the other fields on the **Loyalty customer** FastTab.

5.  On the **Lines** FastTab, click **Add line** to add a new loyalty card for the customer.

6.  In the **Loyalty card type** field, select the type of loyalty card.

7.  In the **Scheme ID** field, select a scheme ID.
