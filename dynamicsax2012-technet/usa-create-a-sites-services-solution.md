# (USA) Create a Sites Services solution [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

After you sign up for and configure your account, you can create your own Sites Services solution with the new solution wizard. For example, you can create a marketing campaign that collects and tracks sales leads, or you can publish customer service information and collect customer feedback. You can also use the solutions that are included with Microsoft Dynamics AX. For more information about the solutions that are included with Microsoft Dynamics AX, see [(USA) Activate or deactivate a solution](usa-activate-or-deactivate-a-solution.md).

Creating the initial solution requires administrator privileges, but adding pages to a solution does not.

1.  Click **Organization administration** \> **Setup** \> **Sites Services** \> **Configuration checklist**.

2.  Click **Create new solution** to open the Sites Services solution wizard.

3.  Follow the instructions in the wizard to create a solution. In the wizard, you specify the following information:
    
      - General information – The name and a description of the solution.
    
      - Page template – The template to use for the pages in the solution. Several layouts are available.
    
      - Subsite URL – The web address for the solution.
    
      - Documents to include – The information from Microsoft Dynamics AX that you want to include.
    
      - Records to publish – The individual records from Microsoft Dynamics AX that you want to include.
    
      - Availability – The module in Microsoft Dynamics AX where you want the solution to appear.

After you complete the wizard, the new solution is activated and ready to have pages added to it. The pages for the site are based on the templates that were created in the wizard. Adding pages to the solution does not require administrator privileges. For more information, see [(USA) Create and manage site pages](usa-create-and-manage-site-pages.md).
