# (BRA) Match a received NF-e XML document against a vendor invoice 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3_

Follow the steps in this topic to automatically match a vendor’s Cadastro Nacional da Pessoa Jurídica (CNPJ) and Inscrição Estadual (IE) and the total amounts in the received Nota Fiscal electronica (NF-e) XML document against a vendor invoice. If you select the **Block NF-e posting if XML does not match** check box on the **NF-e federal** FastTab in the **Fiscal establishments** form, you can post only the electronic fiscal documents for which the XML document information matches the vendor invoice information.

If there are divergences between the received XML document information and the vendor invoice information for the following values, you can approve the divergences to post the vendor invoice:

  - Total fiscal document amount

  - Total product amount

  - Total freight amount

  - Total other charges

  - Total Imposto Sobre Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços (ICMS) base amount

  - Total ICMS-ST (ICMS tributary substitution) base amount

  - Total ICMS-ST amount

  - Total Imposto Sobre Produtos Industrializados (IPI) amount

If you have approved the divergences once and the divergences change, you can cancel the earlier approval and request a new approval.

If there are divergences in the vendor’s CNPJ and IE, these divergences cannot be approved, and the vendor invoice cannot be posted.

## Verify the vendor invoice information and the received NF-e XML information, and then approve divergences

Use this procedure to verify the vendor invoice information and the received NF-e XML information. If there are divergences for the total amounts in the fiscal documents, you can verify the divergences, and then approve or request approval for the divergences.

    –or–
    
    Click **Procurement and sourcing** \> **Common** \> **Purchase orders** \> **All purchase orders**.

2.  Select an approved purchase order for which the NF-e XML document is received. For more information, see [Create vendor invoices from purchase orders](create-vendor-invoices-from-purchase-orders.md) and [(BRA) Enter vendor invoice lines to a vendor invoice for a purchase order](bra-enter-vendor-invoice-lines-to-a-vendor-invoice-for-a-purchase-order.md).

3.  On the **Action Pane**, click **Invoice** \> **Invoice**.

4.  In the **Document model** field, select the fiscal document model.

5.  In the **Vendor invoice** form, in the **Access key** field, enter the identification code of the access key for the vendor invoice.

6.  On the **Action Pane**, click **NF-e XML matching details** to open the **View the NF-e XML and vendor invoice matching details** form, and then verify the details of the vendor invoice and the received NF-e XML document.
    

    > [!NOTE]

> [!NOTE]
> <P>The discount in the vendor invoice line is for a unit, whereas the discount in the NF-e XML line is the total for a line. The discount for a unit of the item is recalculated when you update the discount rate.</P>
