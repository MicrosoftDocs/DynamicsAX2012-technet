# Garnishment and tax levy enrollment tasks 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2_

This topic describes how to enroll workers in garnishments, tax levies, and any associated administrative fees. In Microsoft Dynamics AX, garnishments and tax levies are managed by using the benefit framework. This framework helps make sure that the payroll impact of garnishments and tax levies is handled correctly.

If you have questions about garnishments and tax levies that are not answered in this topic or in [Garnishment and tax levy setup tasks](garnishment-and-tax-levy-setup-tasks.md) or [Garnishments, tax levies, and administrative fees](garnishments-tax-levies-and-administrative-fees.md), contact your legal advisors.

## Enroll a worker in a garnishment or tax levy

When the payroll department receives notice of a court-ordered garnishment or tax levy, the federal government requires that deductions begin within a specific number of days. As with other garnishment rules, some states might use the federal rules, or they might set their own requirements. For example, a state might require that deductions begin with the first payroll payment at least three days after the order is received, which could be the current pay period. Therefore, make sure that you get workers correctly enrolled as quickly as possible.

When you enroll a worker, you will set up payroll information together with garnishment or tax levy details. The steps to enter the garnishment or tax levy details vary, depending on whether the garnishment enhancement hotfix is installed. Make sure that you use the correct steps.

To enroll a worker in a garnishment or tax levy, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Payroll** \> **Common** \> **Workers** \> **Workers**.

2.  Select a worker, click **Personal information**, and then click **Benefits**.

3.  Click **Add**.

4.  In the **Benefit** field, select **Eligibility bypassed**.

5.  Select the benefit for the garnishment or tax levy.
    
    Dependent and beneficiary information isn’t required for a garnishment. You don’t have to do anything on the **Dependents** or **Beneficiaries** FastTabs.

6.  On the **Payroll details** FastTab, enter this information.

    <p>The calculation order is important when the result of the calculation for one benefit is used in the calculation for another benefit. For example, in some states, the deductions for union dues and health plans reduce disposable income. To make sure that the garnishment is calculated correctly, you must make sure that union dues and health plans have a lower calculation priority number than the garnishment does.</p>
    <p>For tax levies, voluntary benefit enrollments that were in place before the tax levy typically have a higher priority than the tax levy. Those benefits must therefore have a lower calculation priority number than the tax levy.</p>

12. If the garnishment enhancement hotfix is installed, on the **Comments** FastTab, click **Add** to enter information about the garnishment or tax levy types you entered or changed.

If your organization charges an administrative fee for handling garnishments, continue with “Optional: Enroll workers in administrative fees” in this topic.

## Optional: Enroll workers in administrative fees

Administrative fees, such as garnishments and tax levies, are processed as benefits in AX 2012. Administrative fees aren’t permitted in every state. Where they are permitted, they are never mandatory. It is up to your organization to decide whether to charge them.

The steps to enroll a worker in an administrative fee vary, depending on whether the garnishment enhancement hotfix is installed.

  - If the garnishment enhancement hotfix isn’t installed, enroll the worker in one administrative fee benefit for each administrative fee that the worker is charged. For each administrative fee benefit, the amount in the **Amount or rate** field on the **Payroll details** FastTab of the **Benefit** form must match the amount in the **Administrative fee** field on the **Garnishment details** FastTab or the **Tax levy details** FastTab of the **Maintain benefits** form.

  - If the garnishment enhancement hotfix is installed, enroll the worker in one administrative fee benefit. The amount in the **Amount or rate** field on the **Payroll details** FastTab of the **Benefit** form for the benefit should equal the sum of all the administrative fees that the worker is charged.

### Enroll a worker in an administrative fee if the garnishment enhancement hotfix is not installed

1.  Click **Payroll** \> **Common** \> **Workers** \> **Workers**.

2.  Select a worker, click **Personal information**, and then click **Benefits**.

3.  Click **Add**.

4.  In the **Benefit** field, select **Eligibility bypassed**.

5.  Select the benefit for an administrative fee.
    
    Dependent and beneficiary information isn’t required for an administrative fee. You don’t have to do anything on the **Dependents** or **Beneficiaries** FastTabs.

6.  On the **Payroll details** FastTab, enter this information.

## Additional setup requirements when a worker is enrolled in multiple garnishments or tax levies and the garnishment enhancement hotfix is not installed

This section applies only if the garnishment enhancement hotfix isn’t installed.

When a worker has more than one garnishment order or tax levy, it might not be possible to deduct the full amount of every garnishment and tax levy. Federal and state laws dictate the maximum amount that can be deducted for all garnishments, tax levies, and administrative fees combined. State laws dictate how to allocate the total amount among the various garnishments and tax levies, based in part on the garnishment type and the calculation priority.

When a worker’s garnishments have the same type and calculation priority, the amounts are calculated automatically. If a worker has more than one kind of garnishment, you might have to perform some of the calculations manually. Procedures for both situations are described later in this topic.

## Set up multiple garnishments of the same type

When a worker has more than one garnishment of the same type and the same calculation priority, you must specify the **Multiple garnishment method** to use to allocate the amount of the deduction among the garnishments, as described in “Enroll a worker in a garnishment or tax levy” earlier in this topic.

When multiple garnishments must be processed together, make sure that the garnishments have the same values in these fields in the **Maintain benefits** form:

  - **Calculation priority**

  - **Garnishment type**

  - **Multiple garnishment method**

A garnishment that has a different value in any one these fields isn’t included with the garnishments that are processed together.

To make sure that garnishments of the same type are calculated correctly, you might have to adjust the calculation priority on one or more of the garnishments so that they match. You should seek guidance from your legal advisors any time that a worker has more than one garnishment or tax levy of the same type.

## Examples of multiple garnishments of the same type

A worker has the following child support orders. Because the calculation priority, garnishment type, and multiple garnishment method of all three child support orders match, the three garnishments are processed together.

**Wages and other factors that influence the garnishment amount**

The worker’s gross wages for the pay period are 2,000.00, and the total amount of taxes and benefits that are excluded from the worker’s disposable income is 600.00. Therefore, the worker’s calculated disposable income is 2,000.00 minus 600.00, or 1,400.00.

The maximum amount that can be withheld from the worker’s pay for these garnishments is 55 percent of 1,400.00, or 770.00.

The total amount that is required by the three garnishments is 45.000 + 225.00 + 200.00, or 875.00.

Because 875.00 is more than 770.00, which is the maximum allowed, the multiple garnishment method must be applied.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If the total garnishments that were requested were less than the maximum withholding allowed, the full amount of each garnishment would be taken and no multiple garnishment method would be applied.</P>



**How the pro rata amount for each garnishment is determined**

In this example, these are the garnishment amounts for the **Pro rata** method:

  - Total amount from all three support orders: 875.00

  - Maximum amount of withholding allowed: 770.00

  - Percentage applicable to the first order: 51 percent (450.00 / 875.00)

  - Percentage applicable to the second order: 26 percent (225.00 / 875.00)

  - Percentage applicable to the third order: 23 percent (200.00 / 875.00)

  - First garnishment amount: 392.70 (770.00 x .51)

  - Second garnishment amount: 200.20 (770.00 x .26)

  - Third garnishment amount: 177.10 (770.00 x .23)

**How the amount is determined by using the Equal method**

Based on the same wages and other factors described above, these are the garnishment amounts for the **Equal** method:

  - Maximum amount of withholding allowed: 770.00

  - Divide by 3 because there are three orders: 256.67

  - Third garnishment amount: 200.00 (the lesser of 256.67 and the requested amount)

  - Second garnishment amount: 225.00 (the lesser of 256.67 and the requested amount)

  - First garnishment amount: 345.00 (the maximum amount of 770.00 reduced by 200.00 from Garn03 and 225.00 from Garn02)

**How the amount is determined by using the First-in method**

Based on the same wages and other factors described above, these are the garnishment amounts for the **First in** method:

  - Maximum amount of withholding allowed: 770.00

  - First garnishment amount: 450.00. This is satisfied in full, and then is subtracted from the maximum amount, which leaves 320.00 for the other two garnishments.

  - Second garnishment amount: 225.00. This is satisfied in full, and then is subtracted from the 320.00 remaining, which leaves 95.00 for the third garnishment.

  - Third garnishment amount: 95.00.

After the amount that is remaining reaches 0 (zero), no additional amounts can be deducted for any garnishment.

## Set up multiple garnishments of different types

When a worker has multiple garnishments of different types, the individual limit that applies to each garnishment can be automatically determined. However, the final deductions against a single limit for the combined total of all of the garnishments can’t be determined. As a result, when there are multiple garnishments of different types, you must manually calculate the total disposable income limit and determine whether the combined amount of all of the garnishments and tax levies exceeds the maximum deduction limit.

If the combined amount exceeds the maximum deduction limit, set the following field values in the **Maintain benefits** form for each garnishment and tax levy that the worker is enrolled in.
