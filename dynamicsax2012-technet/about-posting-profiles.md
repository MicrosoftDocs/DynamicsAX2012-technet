# About posting profiles 


[!INCLUDE[archive-banner](includes/archive-banner.md)]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Posting profiles specify the ledger accounts that are affected when source documents are posted to the general ledger or when journal entries are journalized. You can set up default posting profiles for customers or vendors. The posting profiles for customers or vendors will be used as default entries when source documents or journal entries are created.

Each posting profile is associated with only one offset account. Posting definitions, on the other hand, can be associated with multiple offset accounts. If posting definitions are used, they replace posting profiles for the source documents and journals where they are used. For more information, see [About posting definitions](about-posting-definitions.md).

Posting accounts are specified for items in the inventory **Posting** form.

You can use posting profiles with all journals and source documents.
